[0:00:24] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls.
[0:00:31] SPEAKER_00: You're listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm Brooke Thomas, and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:38] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're having conversations about the awakening spiritual path, and what does
[0:00:42] SPEAKER_00: that mean?
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_00: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything, the beauty and the crazy, the joys and the messes,
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: the bliss and the grit that is a human life?
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_00: After we aired our episode on Healing the Lymphic System, which is two episodes back
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_00: now, we got a similar question from many of our listeners.
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_00: It was phrased in many different ways, but it circled around a theme.
[0:01:06] SPEAKER_00: The question essentially was, for those of us on a path, so much of our instruction,
[0:01:12] SPEAKER_00: whether that be in various spiritual and or psychological settings, is on how to turn
[0:01:17] Unknown: towards ourselves, turning towards our pain, our experiences, and how to really be with
[0:01:26] SPEAKER_00: what we are feeling and experiencing.
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_00: And certainly, Vanessa and I have talked about that quite a lot here on the show.
[0:01:34] SPEAKER_00: Yet dynamic neural retraining systems, which is what we had discussed in the Lymphic System
[0:01:38] Unknown: episode, seems to instruct turning away.
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_00: So what gives?
[0:01:45] SPEAKER_00: Is that bypass?
[0:01:48] SPEAKER_00: Are we suddenly on a whole new track here?
[0:01:52] SPEAKER_00: So we wanted to spend this episode really clarifying what we are talking about when
[0:01:56] SPEAKER_00: we discuss limbic impairment and how understanding limbic impairment has been a profound missing
[0:02:01] Unknown: puzzle piece for both Vanessa and I in our different ways, but heavily related to our
[0:02:07] SPEAKER_00: own unfolding experience.
[0:02:10] SPEAKER_00: Yet it doesn't throw out the baby with the bathwater either.
[0:02:14] SPEAKER_00: So what is it to navigate the full nuance of coming home to ourselves, of turning towards
[0:02:22] Unknown: our inner landscape, and at the same time to acknowledge, as we have many times and
[0:02:28] SPEAKER_00: in many ways, that quite a lot of this inner landscape, maybe all, is not the me we think
[0:02:34] SPEAKER_00: it is.
[0:02:35] SPEAKER_00: For some of us, what we call me is actually a habitual and established trauma loop, which
[0:02:42] SPEAKER_00: does not need to be fed any longer if we want to be free.
[0:02:46] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, there are a few ways you can help support us.

[0:03:12] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[0:03:13] SPEAKER_00: The last thing before we head into the conversation, Vanessa and I curse on occasion, so if you're
[0:03:18] SPEAKER_00: a non-swearing company, you might want headphones.
[0:03:20] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:03:31] Unknown: Hello, darling.
[0:03:36] Unknown: Hello.
[0:03:37] SPEAKER_01: So good to see you post-holiday break.
[0:03:44] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_01: I'm feeling like, uh-oh, did I forget how to do this over the break?
[0:03:48] SPEAKER_01: Will I be any good anymore?
[0:03:52] SPEAKER_01: Well, for all of you listening, we aired Judith Blackstone's conversation last week, but that
[0:03:58] SPEAKER_01: happened pre-holiday break.
[0:04:00] Unknown: So we're coming fresh off of some restorations sprinkled with some family time.
[0:04:07] Unknown: So dun-dun-dun.
[0:04:13] SPEAKER_01: And you know, I think some people are probably a little bit behind on listening possibly
[0:04:18] SPEAKER_01: with all that happens in the holiday season.
[0:04:22] SPEAKER_01: But in mid-December, we shared an episode.
[0:04:24] SPEAKER_01: Do you remember what it was called, Brooke?
[0:04:27] SPEAKER_01: Healing Your Lymphic System.
[0:04:30] SPEAKER_01: Healing Your Lymphic System.
[0:04:32] SPEAKER_01: And we got a lot of responses on that, right?
[0:04:35] SPEAKER_01: We got a lot of emails and comments and remarks.
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_01: And so it seems like it hit a chord.
[0:04:41] Unknown: Yeah, I would say maybe more than, I'd put it in the top 2% of episodes.
[0:04:47] SPEAKER_00: They got a lot of responsiveness.
[0:04:49] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:04:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think so too.
[0:04:51] SPEAKER_01: And I think, you know, in part, one of the wonderful things that you and I have been
[0:04:56] SPEAKER_01: to is actual tools for transformation.
[0:04:59] SPEAKER_01: You know, like how we move beyond the phase of grace and just sitting with emptiness and
[0:05:05] Unknown: into a stage where we're looking for actual, don't make me say it, biohacks for transformation.
[0:05:13] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: For those listening, what Vanessa knows that you might not know is that I rail against
[0:05:20] SPEAKER_00: the biohack industry all the time.
[0:05:22] SPEAKER_00: And I caught myself saying it in one of our private conversations.
[0:05:25] SPEAKER_00: I was like, oh, oh, right.
[0:05:27] Unknown: I mean, ultimately, it's just figuring out what are the most straightforward ways.
[0:05:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:05:34] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_01: Through to wholeness and potentiality and all these beautiful things.
[0:05:39] SPEAKER_01: And the conversation with Judith, I'm hoping for all of you, was a beautiful one because
[0:05:45] Unknown: Judith has such powerful practices to create inner transformation.
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_01: And an awareness of the wholeness that you already are.
[0:05:56] SPEAKER_01: However, we wanted to build upon the episode we did on healing the limbic brain by addressing
[0:06:03] SPEAKER_01: one of the questions that we received.
[0:06:06] SPEAKER_01: And we received it from different people in different ways.
[0:06:11] SPEAKER_01: And when we did that episode, it was really, you know, you Brooke were asking me questions.
[0:06:16] SPEAKER_01: And I was just speaking about a participant about my experience.
[0:06:20] SPEAKER_01: And so we kind of laid out a lot of concepts, but we didn't have time to necessarily dive
[0:06:25] SPEAKER_01: into the depths of all of them.
[0:06:27] SPEAKER_01: Since then, you and I both have been practicing DNRS, but also, naturally, we went and read
[0:06:33] SPEAKER_01: a bunch of things about neuroscience and we've kind of jumped down deep into the hole.
[0:06:39] SPEAKER_01: So I think it'll be a good time to clarify a few of the questions that some of you might
[0:06:44] SPEAKER_01: have had around that episode.
[0:06:46] Unknown: And we're just going to give one listener's email a read and then we'll dive in.
[0:06:53] Unknown: Okay, so our listener says, Wow, fascinating DNSR episode.
[0:07:02] SPEAKER_01: Makes sense to avoid feeling certain neural patterns with constant attention.
[0:07:07] SPEAKER_01: DNRS seems to offer the possibility of turning away rather than toward in a way that heals.
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_01: This has me so curious.
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_01: It seems like most of the practices I do are turning toward, for example, Reggie Ray's
[0:07:24] SPEAKER_01: and Judith Blackstone's.
[0:07:27] SPEAKER_01: Something in me relaxed a bit when I sensed into letting go of constantly turning toward,
[0:07:33] SPEAKER_01: but I'm feeling unsure as if this is what I'm most familiar with.
[0:07:39] SPEAKER_01: I wonder if attuning to love or fundamental consciousness while turning towards makes
[0:07:44] Unknown: the difference.
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_01: And she goes on to say some pleasantries and personal stuff.
[0:07:51] SPEAKER_01: So we thought this would be something really juicy to talk about today.
[0:07:56] SPEAKER_01: The turning towards versus the turning away and what are the subtleties of it.
[0:08:04] SPEAKER_01: And do you want to read that quote from Annie Hopper's book, Brooke?
[0:08:08] SPEAKER_01: I feel like I've been on a talking spree.
[0:08:12] SPEAKER_01: And since, just as a reminder or just in case you're tuning in for the first time, since
[0:08:17] SPEAKER_01: DNRS, which is dynamic neural reintegrate, no, retraining systems, dynamic neural retraining
[0:08:23] SPEAKER_01: systems was created by a woman named Annie Hopper.
[0:08:27] SPEAKER_01: And she writes about it in a book called Wired for Healing.
[0:08:31] SPEAKER_01: And it's a specific neural retraining, just like it says, program designed to help people
[0:08:37] SPEAKER_01: with the condition she has termed limbic impairment, which all of us can hold or think of as a
[0:08:45] SPEAKER_01: chronic over activation of the limbic system within the brain.
[0:08:51] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_00: And typically, you know, for what it's worth, most of the people who come to train with
[0:08:57] SPEAKER_00: her are people who are dealing with chronic mystery type illnesses or things that get
[0:09:01] SPEAKER_00: chucked in the mystery pile.
[0:09:03] Unknown: So multiple chemical sensitivities, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, these kinds of things.
[0:09:14] SPEAKER_00: And you are doing it for like, if we had a label about what brought us each in besides
[0:09:20] SPEAKER_00: this constant inquiry that we have over here on Blessed Grid about consciousness and the
[0:09:24] Unknown: interrelationship of that with what our nervous system's habits are, you're doing it for chronic
[0:09:30] SPEAKER_00: illness and I'm doing it for PTSD and anxiety.
[0:09:33] SPEAKER_00: So a couple of different perspectives on that.
[0:09:37] SPEAKER_00: So I'm going to read a quote from Annie Hopper related to the question that you just read.
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_00: What I learned was that it wasn't particularly productive to keep analyzing the same negative
[0:09:48] SPEAKER_00: emotions and thoughts as one might in a behavioral psychology model.
[0:09:52] SPEAKER_00: The negative emotion that would normally dissipate with attention and acknowledgement in a traditional
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_00: therapeutic method actually grow stronger in the case of limbic system injury.
[0:10:02] SPEAKER_00: The more attention that you give to an established trauma pattern, the more rooted it becomes
[0:10:07] SPEAKER_00: as a dysfunctional pathway in the brain.
[0:10:10] SPEAKER_00: What I also recognized was that simply observing the thoughts or feelings was not enough.
[0:10:15] SPEAKER_00: Observation skills created some distance, but this alone did not stop the trauma pattern.
[0:10:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to read just a teensy bit more.
[0:10:23] SPEAKER_00: However, when the experience is addressed from a therapeutic perspective of understanding,
[0:10:28] Unknown: compassion, self-love, and empowerment, a different emotional response and a different
[0:10:33] Unknown: understanding of this experience can be generated.
[0:10:39] SPEAKER_00: So to speak to this a little bit from my perspective, I mean, all of this is exactly what you and
[0:10:44] SPEAKER_00: I have been circling for our lifetimes, but in particularly for the last few years and
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_00: doing it in public here on Blessed Grid.
[0:10:53] Unknown: As we become more conscious, as we live our path, as we heal, whatever phrases you want
[0:11:01] SPEAKER_00: to use, I mean, you and I in some ways are just like this living lab, right?
[0:11:06] SPEAKER_00: Like, well, how does it go?
[0:11:08] SPEAKER_01: So much.
[0:11:10] Unknown: And we're willing to be, because we're not promoting any particular dogma or any particular
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_00: blueprint or the one lineage or anything.
[0:11:23] SPEAKER_00: We're basically just co-exploring and then we can genuinely report on, well, what's the
[0:11:28] SPEAKER_00: truth of this for me?
[0:11:30] SPEAKER_00: What was my experience like?
[0:11:31] Unknown: Which doesn't mean that's some kind of prediction about what that means for everyone.
[0:11:39] Unknown: And one of the things that we've struck on frequently is that, you know, it's where do
[0:11:48] SPEAKER_00: spiritual teachings and a spiritual path and a healing path intersect with what our nervous
[0:11:53] Unknown: system is up to?
[0:11:55] Unknown: And turns out you and I, for our own reasons, have limbic system impairments and that that
[0:12:02] Unknown: actually gives us a particular experience of life.
[0:12:08] SPEAKER_00: And so in my case, I can think of several times, you know, and I've spoken on the show
[0:12:14] SPEAKER_00: a great deal about the fact that I went through a dark night of the soul.
[0:12:18] Unknown: Some people may be familiar with that listening, but there were ways that because my nervous
[0:12:27] Unknown: system knew how to be hypervigilant, knew how to be terrified, knew how to be stuck
[0:12:34] Unknown: in a trauma loop.
[0:12:37] Unknown: It would do that.
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_00: That's what it knows how to do.
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_00: And so I could bring practices to my life, practices of awareness.
[0:12:46] SPEAKER_00: I could have experiences of awakening.
[0:12:51] SPEAKER_00: And ultimately they would get translated in a way where I experienced them as being traumatized
[0:12:57] SPEAKER_00: to the point that at the worst stage of it, I wasn't super functional.
[0:13:02] Unknown: And I was dealing with strange things like limb weakness, arms and legs not being real
[0:13:09] SPEAKER_00: functional at certain times, got a lot of medical tests, things like that.
[0:13:12] Unknown: And if I look back and I'm like, okay, well, what?
[0:13:16] SPEAKER_00: Yes, I had had some very big openings and awakening experiences, which were initially
[0:13:22] Unknown: interpreted as what great news, what a relief.
[0:13:26] SPEAKER_00: And then my limbic loop would sort of take over and it would be experienced as annihilation
[0:13:32] SPEAKER_00: of the self.
[0:13:33] SPEAKER_00: And annihilation of the self means annihilation of the self.
[0:13:35] Unknown: So it feels like a trauma.
[0:13:39] SPEAKER_00: And I would do practices where I would think that, okay, well then I guess I had better
[0:13:45] SPEAKER_00: turn towards more.
[0:13:48] SPEAKER_00: So in one case, I was dealing with some memories resurfacing again in a PTSD type way.
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_00: And so it was like, okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to really double down.
[0:14:02] Unknown: I'm going to go to bed for whatever days if I need to.
[0:14:08] SPEAKER_00: And I'm going to, I did for two days, it was two days where I didn't have my son.
[0:14:11] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, I'm clearing my whole calendar and I'm going to go to bed, not to sleep,
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_00: and just keep turning towards, keep evoking.
[0:14:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to put my foot on the gas and be like, all right, if it means I get to be over
[0:14:28] Unknown: feeling of being terrified and wanting to die, then I'll just pedal to the metal, you
[0:14:36] SPEAKER_00: know, like really, really go back and replay the memories.
[0:14:40] SPEAKER_00: And I was doing ho'oponopono practice with it thinking that that would be, which is actually
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_00: gorgeous, gorgeous practice and very, was in some ways helpful.
[0:14:48] Unknown: But the problem was my brain was like so good at recreating the memories and all of the
[0:14:56] Unknown: sensations that came with them that I was re-traumatizing myself.
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_00: Now I can say this out loud now and it's like, duh, you know, anyone with just like a very
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_00: basic understanding of trauma care can go, duh.
[0:15:10] SPEAKER_00: But when you're the person, like even though I've studied, I've received a lot of trauma
[0:15:14] Unknown: therapy, very good care, I, my life's devoted to this.
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_00: Like I've read all the books, I know all the really interesting ways and practices, but
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_00: when your brain, when that's its habits, it is not duh in that moment.
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_00: You do not realize that you're re-injuring yourself.
[0:15:32] SPEAKER_00: And there's so much confusion about what to do, you know, so it was months and months
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_00: and months and months later.
[0:15:41] SPEAKER_00: And even still, it's like just getting clarity of like, oh, because we can code it in so
[0:15:47] SPEAKER_00: many different ways.
[0:15:49] SPEAKER_00: Like there's a lot of information out there like, oh, well on the spiritual path, sometimes
[0:15:54] Unknown: people's lives completely fall apart because they, you know, know that they're God or whatever.
[0:16:02] SPEAKER_00: That's true.
[0:16:03] Unknown: It happened to me, but does it have to happen?
[0:16:06] SPEAKER_00: Or is it just because these are people who have limbic system impairments?
[0:16:11] Unknown: And if we could take spirituality out of the woo-woo land and pair it with really coherent
[0:16:21] SPEAKER_00: understanding of the nervous system and limbic system loops, could we just get rid of this
[0:16:28] Unknown: whole notion that we are going to be doomed or go through a period of extreme dark night?
[0:16:36] SPEAKER_00: I actually don't know the answer to this question, but I am really curious about it.
[0:16:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know.
[0:16:42] SPEAKER_01: I mean, this is just our question.
[0:16:43] SPEAKER_00: This is the inquiry, right?
[0:16:44] SPEAKER_01: Like this is the inquiry that we're up to.
[0:16:49] SPEAKER_01: I know it's, I feel like the lens of limbic impairment, you know, when you understand,
[0:16:55] SPEAKER_01: but it's like you only have 98% of a puzzle and that one piece is an important piece that
[0:17:02] SPEAKER_01: integrates the whole picture.
[0:17:05] Unknown: That's how I feel when I got this understanding that Annie put forward and it's not just Annie.
[0:17:12] SPEAKER_01: Dr. Joe Dispenza talks about it.
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_01: Dr. Bruce Lipton talks about it.
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_01: Norman Deutsch, like so many, yeah, there's so much of this.
[0:17:20] SPEAKER_01: There are so many people out there who are speaking to this, but when I got this understanding
[0:17:25] SPEAKER_01: of the limbic impairment, for some reason, maybe it was ripe timing or maybe it was the
[0:17:30] SPEAKER_01: way Annie put it forward.
[0:17:32] SPEAKER_01: It was like something locking into place.
[0:17:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I agree.
[0:17:36] SPEAKER_01: And it was like a new lens that I could then go back, like you were describing, Brooke,
[0:17:41] Unknown: and see all sorts of things through that lens, something I hadn't understood before or even
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_01: maybe things I understood, but now I had a much different articulation of them.
[0:17:56] SPEAKER_01: So I want to say before I forget, if you're listening and you're wondering, do I have
[0:18:01] SPEAKER_01: limbic impairment?
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_01: Because we're going to be talking about this for the conversation.
[0:18:06] SPEAKER_01: You can go onto the website for DNRS.
[0:18:09] SPEAKER_01: We have the resources and the show notes, but Google it.
[0:18:13] SPEAKER_00: You'll find it.
[0:18:14] SPEAKER_01: Retraining your brain or something, but you'll find it.
[0:18:19] SPEAKER_01: And I think on the website, definitely in the book, there's a like a little quiz you
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_01: can take to see if you have a limbic impairment.
[0:18:26] Unknown: So before we forget to say that.
[0:18:31] SPEAKER_01: And it is something particular.
[0:18:33] SPEAKER_01: It is a chronic state of overactivation of the survival mechanisms in your body.
[0:18:42] SPEAKER_01: So if you've listened to us talk about vagal tone and the nervous system, we talk about
[0:18:48] SPEAKER_01: a chronic overactivation of the fight or flight or freeze nervous systems.
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_01: We're just talking about the same thing only in the command center in the brain.
[0:18:58] SPEAKER_01: We're in a reciprocal bottom up top down relationship, but most of the chemistry is
[0:19:04] SPEAKER_01: made by the brain.
[0:19:05] SPEAKER_01: So here we are.
[0:19:07] SPEAKER_01: We're talking to what Dr. Bruce Lipton, who's a biologist who speaks about this a lot.
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_01: He calls the brain the chemist.
[0:19:15] SPEAKER_01: It is the one designing the internal environment of the body.
[0:19:19] SPEAKER_01: So even though not everybody has this chronic overactivation of the limbic system that might
[0:19:26] SPEAKER_01: be called the limbic impairment.
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_01: Look around at our culture.
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_01: There's no doubt in my mind that it may not be to such an extreme that they could manifest
[0:19:38] SPEAKER_01: dark night of the soul or terror loops or suicidality or hopelessness, things that you
[0:19:45] SPEAKER_01: and I have experienced.
[0:19:46] SPEAKER_00: Or the chemical sensitivities and all those other things.
[0:19:49] SPEAKER_00: Chronic illnesses.
[0:19:50] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:19:52] SPEAKER_01: But nevertheless, most people can relate to this conversation and what it's like to be
[0:19:59] SPEAKER_01: hijacked by the thought structures that exist within the limbic portion of the brain.
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_01: So I think that's just interesting to say.
[0:20:10] Unknown: Well, let me pause there.
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_01: Do you have something to say before I keep going on a tear?
[0:20:15] SPEAKER_00: No, I don't.
[0:20:16] SPEAKER_00: And I love your tears.
[0:20:17] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, go nuts.
[0:20:19] Unknown: But maybe we, I mean, I feel like you framed it pretty well.
[0:20:24] SPEAKER_00: I was just going to say maybe we say like, what does limbic system impairment even mean?
[0:20:28] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you just wove it into that whole bit of conversation.
[0:20:32] Unknown: But yeah, we're talking about a actual anatomical structure in the brain that is stuck in a
[0:20:41] SPEAKER_00: rut basically.
[0:20:42] SPEAKER_00: It's stuck in a feedback loop and it's creating symptoms.
[0:20:46] Unknown: And those symptoms can vary from person to person, whether it's anxiety or illness or,
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_00: you know, chronic fatigue syndrome, vertigo, who knows?
[0:20:58] SPEAKER_00: And that this can happen, and I think this is important to say because our culture does
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_00: a bang up job of if there's ever a bridge between the mind and the body, which there's
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_00: not even not a bridge because they're the same thing.
[0:21:09] SPEAKER_00: But even the mind body bridge is like this funny, like you travel across.
[0:21:13] SPEAKER_00: It's like they're the same thing.
[0:21:16] Unknown: But because we don't understand that interrelatedness and because we're a shame culture, we do the
[0:21:23] SPEAKER_00: whole it's all in their head.
[0:21:25] Unknown: And it's all in their head usually means you're making it up or subconsciously you wanted
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_00: to get attention or, you know, even if we put the subconscious on it, we usually make
[0:21:37] SPEAKER_00: it about being needy or being a mess or none of these things are true.
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_00: So these impairments come upon a person 100% in innocence, whether it's because of exposure
[0:21:52] SPEAKER_00: to a toxin or it's because of experiencing repeated trauma.
[0:21:57] SPEAKER_00: This is an acquired brain injury that has nothing to do with a messed up person being
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_00: super needy.
[0:22:04] SPEAKER_00: So want to say that.
[0:22:06] SPEAKER_01: I know even when people say it's like all in your head.
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_00: It's like, yeah, it's like, well, it doesn't have the implication.
[0:22:12] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_01: You mean like, yeah, it's in my brain.
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_01: But, you know, as we are learning, rewiring your brain is no simple thing.
[0:22:21] SPEAKER_01: So it's no different than having any other kind of exactly like you wouldn't say to someone
[0:22:25] SPEAKER_00: with diabetes.
[0:22:26] SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's all in your pancreas.
[0:22:27] Unknown: It's like, well, yeah, I didn't choose it.
[0:22:36] SPEAKER_01: What I've been realizing.
[0:22:37] SPEAKER_01: So now I've been doing the practices.
[0:22:39] SPEAKER_01: Oh, a month.
[0:22:41] SPEAKER_00: Happy anniversary.
[0:22:44] SPEAKER_01: And I went home for the holidays to be around my family and I stay in the house with my
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_01: mom and dad.
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_01: This has always been a little bit of an intense overexposure for me.
[0:22:55] SPEAKER_01: Now the interesting thing is my mom and dad are very nice to me.
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_01: That's not the problem.
[0:23:00] SPEAKER_01: They're not abusive.
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_01: There's nothing happening in this current moment with them towards me or in our relationship.
[0:23:07] Unknown: But they have very over activated limbic brains.
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_01: And once you start to feel it, you can discern what I'm talking about.
[0:23:18] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:23:19] Unknown: It's like you can feel when someone's in a hijack versus when someone's just got a different
[0:23:25] SPEAKER_01: opinion than you or versus when someone's just having an adaptive emotion that's going
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_01: to move through them.
[0:23:31] SPEAKER_01: Like you can start to sense this terrain, especially easy for me once I felt it in myself.
[0:23:37] SPEAKER_01: You know, usually once I can feel all of these subtle nuances in myself, I could then see
[0:23:43] SPEAKER_01: the pattern and how it's opening up in other people.
[0:23:46] Unknown: So I'm in the house with them.
[0:23:49] SPEAKER_01: Within two or three days, my brain is on fire limbic mode.
[0:23:53] SPEAKER_01: It's like I all of this amazing work I had done and I didn't lose it.
[0:23:58] SPEAKER_01: So that's the good news.
[0:23:59] SPEAKER_01: But in that moment and I could see pessimism and I could see despair and I could see anxiety
[0:24:04] SPEAKER_01: and I could see this feeling like I got to get out of here.
[0:24:08] SPEAKER_01: That was how it felt a lot like I got to get out of here.
[0:24:11] SPEAKER_01: I saved myself and all of that was happening just from being around them.
[0:24:17] SPEAKER_01: Now they fight with each other.
[0:24:18] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's not like it's this peaceful coexistence.
[0:24:21] Unknown: But what I came to understand clearly was, you know, my parents had fairly traumatizing
[0:24:28] SPEAKER_01: lives, most especially my mother, and my mother's life really was capital T trauma.
[0:24:34] SPEAKER_01: And her brain was formed with no attachment to her mother.
[0:24:40] SPEAKER_01: I mean, she was separated from her mother most of her early life.
[0:24:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, a lot of capital T trauma.
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_01: So she really has a limbic impairment.
[0:24:50] SPEAKER_01: And as I sat with that, I realized, oh, I've always had this limbic impairment.
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_01: And then, of course, certain things came along in my life, factors that brought on
[0:25:01] SPEAKER_01: illness and it created what we can call a perfect storm.
[0:25:04] SPEAKER_01: Right. And that's true for a lot of people.
[0:25:07] SPEAKER_01: Maybe they had earlier episodes in their childhood that were very stressful, but it
[0:25:11] SPEAKER_01: was only after their divorce and then a car accident and then, you know, their kid got
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_01: sick and then a tick bite and then a chemical exposure.
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_01: And all of a sudden, it's this perfect storm where your brain's really in, you know, a
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_01: severe emergency mode.
[0:25:28] SPEAKER_01: But when I look at that and I realized, oh, I've had this my whole life, it's just a
[0:25:33] SPEAKER_01: furthering of what you and I have been talking about.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: We realize, oh, well, then what you identify as you.
[0:25:41] SPEAKER_01: In a lot of ways can be a limbic thought track.
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And I say it like that because we think it's personal.
[0:25:50] SPEAKER_01: Like when I was suicidal, I would think, oh, what's going on with Vanessa?
[0:25:56] SPEAKER_01: That she's, you know, got this suicidal ideation and she's so prone to going to
[0:26:02] SPEAKER_01: despair. Right. So I had this very psychological conversation, as you were saying
[0:26:06] SPEAKER_01: before, Brooke, about like, is it in the subconscious?
[0:26:09] SPEAKER_01: Like, I am a psychologist by training.
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_01: I'm a life coach. But I can notice now how much we psychologize everything and where
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_01: that can start to be a problem.
[0:26:20] SPEAKER_01: So I would look at it very much like Vanessa and she's got these feelings and and
[0:26:24] SPEAKER_01: that's fine. I'm sure I got something rich out of it.
[0:26:27] SPEAKER_01: But what I can see in healing a lot and going in and out of this part of my brain is
[0:26:33] SPEAKER_01: no, pretty much if you're in your limbic brain, you think about killing yourself
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_01: sometimes. It's not particularly special and it's not particularly.
[0:26:44] SPEAKER_01: Pointing towards my personality structure or really anything about Vanessa, other
[0:26:52] SPEAKER_01: than she has a brain that keeps slipping into limbic activation and keeps wanting
[0:26:59] SPEAKER_01: to defend itself and that maybe I'm more prone to harming myself than others.
[0:27:05] SPEAKER_01: Like, really, that's a lot of the interesting information.
[0:27:08] SPEAKER_01: Now, earlier in life, I thought it was much more interesting, like, oh, why do I
[0:27:12] Unknown: have despair? Like, actually, well, yeah, anyone in the limbic mode does.
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_01: That's what happens. That, to me, is really the beginning of something interesting.
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_01: And we start talking about turning towards and if we do or if we look away and if we
[0:27:30] SPEAKER_01: turn towards, how do we turn towards?
[0:27:32] SPEAKER_01: Like, as we have this conversation, I think it's interesting to begin framing out
[0:27:36] Unknown: that some of these things, these emotions that you think are you, because anyone
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_01: who's had a limbic impairment, unless it came later in life from a toxin injury
[0:27:47] SPEAKER_01: and was unexpected, but if you've had kind of this slow burn of limbic overactivation,
[0:27:55] Unknown: there are going to be thoughts and feelings and beliefs that are not so personal as you
[0:28:02] SPEAKER_01: think and are not so interesting psychologically as you think and not so worthy of
[0:28:08] Unknown: journaling, but are actually a simple reflection of any human who was caught in
[0:28:16] SPEAKER_01: their survival mechanism.
[0:28:18] Unknown: Yeah. And there's a way that just like your painting, you know, but that we can
[0:28:24] Unknown: theropize ourselves deeper into the groove because we're basically just saying over
[0:28:30] SPEAKER_00: and over again, I am this, I am this, I am this.
[0:28:34] SPEAKER_00: And so where this intersects with spiritual practices about turning towards, which I'm
[0:28:40] SPEAKER_00: not against. And we'll get into like, how are they utilized in useful ways if you're
[0:28:46] SPEAKER_00: somebody with a limbic impairment?
[0:28:50] Unknown: You know, so if I'm somebody with a lot of, well, terror was one of the main ones for
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_00: me. So feeling of being just absolutely terrified, like I am going to die any second
[0:29:01] SPEAKER_00: now, terror. I mean, if I keep turning towards it, I am terrified.
[0:29:06] SPEAKER_00: I see you, terror, high terror, hello, terror.
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_00: And then we can do like, I love you, terror.
[0:29:10] SPEAKER_00: I understand you're here and innocence terror.
[0:29:12] SPEAKER_00: I know you don't want to hurt me, terror.
[0:29:14] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's like, it's just like, I know exactly.
[0:29:19] SPEAKER_00: Is it better yet?
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_00: Is it different yet?
[0:29:24] SPEAKER_00: This was not helpful.
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_00: It's what I can say now.
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_00: I can remember a time and it's kind of funny because it's a bajillion years ago.
[0:29:36] Unknown: I was like 22 where I had, and I've talked about this a little bit here and there, but
[0:29:41] SPEAKER_00: I had anxiety attacks, which just felt like this kind of rushing of energy through my
[0:29:45] SPEAKER_00: body. But diagnosed by a neurologist as anxiety attacks, whether they're anxiety
[0:29:49] SPEAKER_00: attacks or bliss attacks, I don't know, but they were big feelings in the body.
[0:29:53] SPEAKER_00: And once I found out because I grew up with a seizure disorder, so it's also easy for
[0:29:59] SPEAKER_00: me to to decide this must mean there's something wrong with my brain in this sort of
[0:30:04] SPEAKER_00: seizure disorder category.
[0:30:06] SPEAKER_00: You know, do I need to go back down that route that I spent chunks of time in growing
[0:30:12] SPEAKER_00: up? And so once I got cleared medically, like, OK, this isn't because you have your
[0:30:18] SPEAKER_00: seizure pattern has changed and now it produces this result.
[0:30:21] SPEAKER_00: This isn't because you have a brain tumor.
[0:30:23] SPEAKER_00: This isn't because you have a heart problem.
[0:30:25] SPEAKER_00: You know, I had gotten cleared of these things in my 20s.
[0:30:28] SPEAKER_00: I thanks to my wonderful doctor, who I had way back when I had my jaw disorder, who
[0:30:35] SPEAKER_00: had told me that meditation needed to become a part of my life.
[0:30:38] SPEAKER_00: I decided that I would meditate.
[0:30:42] SPEAKER_00: In order to heal the anxiety disorder, because I come from a family of addicts and
[0:30:47] SPEAKER_00: didn't want to live on benzos.
[0:30:49] SPEAKER_00: But what I did, interestingly, and this is where it's like just divine providence, I
[0:30:53] SPEAKER_00: don't know why, instead of going I sitting down and feeling like amplifying the
[0:30:59] Unknown: sensation, I would just meditate.
[0:31:02] SPEAKER_00: And then if they happen very frequently.
[0:31:05] Unknown: So if one would come, I would just tell myself this isn't a real thing.
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing wrong with my body.
[0:31:16] Unknown: I know this feels really big and like there must be something wrong with my body, but
[0:31:20] SPEAKER_00: there isn't anything wrong with my body.
[0:31:23] Unknown: And then I would turn my attention away from it.
[0:31:28] SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't go fantasize like imagine you're running through a meadow or whatever.
[0:31:34] SPEAKER_00: But I would actually just turn towards the space, which is kind of funny to think about
[0:31:39] SPEAKER_00: basic stuff.
[0:31:40] SPEAKER_00: I'm sitting in a room.
[0:31:42] SPEAKER_00: I see the wall in front of me.
[0:31:44] SPEAKER_00: The air temperature feels nice.
[0:31:46] Unknown: And that in very short amount of time resolved those 100% without any medication.
[0:31:54] SPEAKER_00: And so it's really interesting to look back and be like, wow, I had something figured
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_00: out there.
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_00: And in my mind, it was like, I'm having this problem, do it until the problem goes
[0:32:02] SPEAKER_00: away.
[0:32:02] SPEAKER_00: And I stopped.
[0:32:03] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I still meditated, but I just never had to.
[0:32:06] SPEAKER_00: Everything else of the limbic system loop was so much more ingrained into what I
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_00: thought was Brooke.
[0:32:12] SPEAKER_00: Brooke's personality, right?
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm the kind of person who has anxiety or I'm the kind of person who has suicidal
[0:32:20] SPEAKER_00: thoughts or whatever.
[0:32:24] SPEAKER_00: That it just hadn't occurred to me.
[0:32:26] SPEAKER_00: And this is what's so amazing and crazy and exciting, like 20 some years later now
[0:32:32] SPEAKER_00: to be like, oh, like I can really keep going with this.
[0:32:37] SPEAKER_00: All those things that I thought were just me or just uncomfortable things I had to
[0:32:42] Unknown: tolerate can be healed through a neuroplastic approach.
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_01: Well, this is what we're banking on.
[0:32:51] SPEAKER_01: I think it would be interesting.
[0:32:52] SPEAKER_01: I think I would love to read some of the neurobiology before we move into the what
[0:32:58] SPEAKER_01: could we do and how might it look different from a limbic impairment from someone who's
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_01: not dealing with a limbic impairment.
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_01: But quick side note, you know what I just read about benzos the other day, that what
[0:33:10] SPEAKER_01: they're shown to do is calm the limbic brain.
[0:33:14] SPEAKER_00: Oh, interesting.
[0:33:16] SPEAKER_00: Really interesting.
[0:33:16] SPEAKER_00: Why people like them so much.
[0:33:18] SPEAKER_00: They also do for those of you listening, a whole bunch of other really nasty
[0:33:22] SPEAKER_00: biological shit.
[0:33:22] Unknown: So they also mess with literally every other system of your body.
[0:33:30] SPEAKER_01: But it is part of why people who go to them get efficacy.
[0:33:37] SPEAKER_01: So if you understand like, oh, OK, well, if it's working for me, it means I have limbic
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_01: activation and there are other ways that I can begin to work with my limbic system.
[0:33:50] SPEAKER_01: And I can see that.
[0:33:51] SPEAKER_01: So I thought that was really cool because a lot of people do rely on benzos these days.
[0:33:56] SPEAKER_01: So let me read something about the neurobiology just so we can start to deepen that.
[0:34:01] SPEAKER_01: That you could read an entire book on the neurobiology of this is just to begin to give
[0:34:05] SPEAKER_01: some language to that.
[0:34:07] Unknown: So what we're getting at here and this is something that Annie's pointing towards is
[0:34:14] SPEAKER_01: that there's a difference between just the average person having an emotional experience
[0:34:22] SPEAKER_01: and sitting with their therapist, their friend, their coach, their mentor, you know,
[0:34:28] SPEAKER_01: a role for whatever it is and somebody whose brain is stuck in, let's call it trauma
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_01: mode, right, survival mode.
[0:34:36] SPEAKER_01: But it's like trauma mode.
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: And so what she says is typical therapeutic processes that involve uncovering emotions
[0:34:45] SPEAKER_01: such as pain, fear, anger, resentment or hopelessness are not recommended for the
[0:34:50] SPEAKER_01: patient suffering from limbic system dysfunction due to their condition.
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_01: The patient's not capable of healthy processing of a traumatic event.
[0:35:00] SPEAKER_01: Rather, the treatment is likely to reinforce the patient's trauma.
[0:35:05] SPEAKER_01: Every time we consciously engage the patient in memories or experiences associated with
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_01: the trauma, we are actually re-engaging the neurological pathways that are involved with
[0:35:18] Unknown: the threat mechanism and reinforcing the threat.
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_01: Even if a new intellectual understanding of the experience is temporarily attained,
[0:35:28] SPEAKER_01: the brain is unable to process this new perception and will ultimately revert to the
[0:35:34] SPEAKER_01: dysfunctional threat patterns that are characteristic of limbic system conditions.
[0:35:41] SPEAKER_01: Negative thoughts and emotions, as well as the repetitive nature of these feelings, can
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_01: be symptomatic of limbic system dysfunction and entertaining these emotions can actually
[0:35:53] SPEAKER_01: reinforce the pathological neural pathways.
[0:35:56] SPEAKER_01: So you all may have heard the saying because we have a pretty smart audience, but whatever
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_01: fires together, wires together.
[0:36:04] SPEAKER_01: Right. So we talk a lot about conditioning on this show.
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_01: And when we speak about conditioning, if you've been listening for a while, you've
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_01: probably heard us say conditioning is in the body.
[0:36:17] SPEAKER_01: It's not a figment of our imagination.
[0:36:21] SPEAKER_01: You know, when we think of thoughts, maybe our idea is that there's some floating
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_01: electromagnetic cloud, but it's like a thought is triggered because a specific neural
[0:36:33] SPEAKER_01: pathway has been engaged in the brain.
[0:36:38] SPEAKER_01: Right. Now, it may even start in the body and then trigger the brain.
[0:36:43] SPEAKER_01: We're not in the top down, bottom up debate.
[0:36:46] SPEAKER_01: But rather that conditioning is in fact stored in the body.
[0:36:51] SPEAKER_01: Judith spoke about it in the fascia.
[0:36:54] SPEAKER_01: That would be a bottom up.
[0:36:56] SPEAKER_01: And other people like Annie Hopper and neuroscientists would talk about it being in the
[0:37:00] SPEAKER_01: brain. And it goes both ways, really.
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_01: So when we have these chronic, repetitive, emotional narratives that play and all of
[0:37:13] Unknown: us know them, those trauma stories, and we keep turning towards them and dissecting
[0:37:19] SPEAKER_01: them and analyzing them and looking at them and wondering why they happened and
[0:37:23] SPEAKER_01: reimagining them and talking about them.
[0:37:26] SPEAKER_01: Part of what happens is we further reinforce the neural network.
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_01: Now, the more times you ride down a neural path, the bigger it gets, the juicier it
[0:37:38] SPEAKER_01: gets, the more alive it gets and the more likely it is to be selected to be driven
[0:37:44] Unknown: down again. Right.
[0:37:46] Unknown: So the more we strengthen the neural connections by bringing our attention to some
[0:37:54] SPEAKER_01: kind of painful trauma or painful narrative from the past, the more we then get the
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_01: thought, emotion or feeling that reminds us of the painful trauma or painful narrative
[0:38:09] SPEAKER_01: from the past.
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_01: So this is part of the neurobiological understanding of, OK, we can see that this is
[0:38:19] SPEAKER_01: just true. Like the more you think about it, the more you think about it, the more you
[0:38:23] SPEAKER_01: attend to it, the more it grabs your attention.
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_01: This is Neurobiology 101.
[0:38:29] SPEAKER_01: But our question always has been then.
[0:38:32] SPEAKER_01: So then what do we do?
[0:38:34] SPEAKER_01: Right. If by thinking of all these painful things, I can reinforce it.
[0:38:40] Unknown: What do I do? Especially when I, my conscious mind is not exactly calling the shots.
[0:38:49] SPEAKER_01: And I think this is the other piece of the neurobiology that we have to bring in.
[0:38:54] SPEAKER_01: And they say 95 percent of what we do think and feel tends to be from the unconscious
[0:39:02] Unknown: being. Right.
[0:39:04] SPEAKER_01: That's the unconscious programs.
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_01: And only about five percent.
[0:39:08] SPEAKER_01: And maybe this is not quite right, but it's something in this vicinity is conscious
[0:39:13] Unknown: processing. So what that means is I can't just say to myself, Vanessa, don't think
[0:39:19] SPEAKER_01: about those things.
[0:39:20] SPEAKER_01: Vanessa, those things aren't true.
[0:39:22] SPEAKER_01: Vanessa, don't bother with that.
[0:39:24] SPEAKER_01: Vanessa, put on a happy face.
[0:39:25] SPEAKER_01: Vanessa, manifest something pretty.
[0:39:27] Unknown: I can't just override the thoughts, feelings and emotions that are being triggered
[0:39:36] SPEAKER_01: through associations and recreated by the limbic brain and by our nervous system and
[0:39:41] SPEAKER_01: by our fascia, perhaps in our muscles and ourselves.
[0:39:45] SPEAKER_01: So if I can't just control that through conscious will by saying, don't do it.
[0:39:52] SPEAKER_01: Hey, just stop.
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: Don't think about it anymore.
[0:39:55] SPEAKER_01: What is it that we do when these thoughts, feelings, narratives, patterns, illnesses
[0:40:01] SPEAKER_01: and beliefs arise?
[0:40:05] SPEAKER_00: You're so mean and then you stop.
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_01: What is it we do?
[0:40:08] SPEAKER_01: Boom. Go, Brooke.
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_01: Well, I could keep going.
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, keep going.
[0:40:11] SPEAKER_00: I felt like you were on a.
[0:40:12] SPEAKER_01: That's on a roll.
[0:40:13] SPEAKER_00: On a good roll.
[0:40:15] SPEAKER_01: Well, here's what we could do.
[0:40:16] SPEAKER_01: Well, this begins to be where our question of turning towards is.
[0:40:21] SPEAKER_01: So historically, we get a certain amount of relief from talking about things.
[0:40:26] SPEAKER_01: And I believe we said this in the DNRS episode on the limbic pathway.
[0:40:30] Unknown: But there is something to be said.
[0:40:32] SPEAKER_01: The first time you name something, an experience, a feeling, a story, the first
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_01: time you connect the dots, oh, my father was like this and that's why I'm like this.
[0:40:42] SPEAKER_01: It is very helpful.
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_01: And in fact, your brain will show a decrease in survival activity.
[0:40:47] SPEAKER_01: It will show relaxation.
[0:40:49] SPEAKER_01: Second time, that's the same.
[0:40:52] SPEAKER_01: According to what I've read over the third time, fourth time, fifth time, that's when
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_01: it starts to be a self-reinforcing neural feedback loop.
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: In our other episode, we spoke about a biochemical addiction that can get created to
[0:41:05] SPEAKER_01: stress chemicals.
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_01: And you all can listen to that.
[0:41:08] SPEAKER_01: But it's just like the neural loop is also getting reinforced.
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_01: So, yes, there's a time and place to talk about things.
[0:41:17] SPEAKER_01: And if you don't have a limbic impairment, maybe that's forever.
[0:41:20] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_00: Right. Go nuts.
[0:41:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:41:22] SPEAKER_00: Go nuts.
[0:41:22] SPEAKER_01: Talk.
[0:41:23] SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's what we do.
[0:41:24] SPEAKER_01: That's how we connect.
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:41:25] Unknown: But it certainly, at some point, it's very helpful.
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_01: So then there was turning towards, and I said this in our other episode, you know, and
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_01: maybe you heard us talk about this with Judith.
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_01: There was a phase where I was so dissociated, I couldn't even acknowledge my experience.
[0:41:42] SPEAKER_01: I couldn't feel it.
[0:41:43] SPEAKER_01: You know, we had someone write to us recently on Facebook saying that they've been trying
[0:41:48] SPEAKER_01: to do these somatic meditations.
[0:41:51] SPEAKER_01: And if they have a feeling like, you know, turn towards the feeling, if I have anger,
[0:41:55] SPEAKER_01: turn towards anger, but they can't find it in their body.
[0:41:58] SPEAKER_01: Well, that's how I was.
[0:42:00] SPEAKER_01: I couldn't find things like what?
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_01: What is it?
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_01: And then if I could find it, I didn't know what the feeling was.
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_01: So there was a certain amount of time, as we've said before, where turning towards was
[0:42:10] SPEAKER_01: a huge beginning of acknowledging and admitting I had feelings.
[0:42:16] SPEAKER_00: And bringing a lot of that 95% unconscious up to consciousness, which is really helpful.
[0:42:22] SPEAKER_00: You know, if your life has been run on a myriad of unconscious programs.
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's that is the other thing.
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_01: It's interesting.
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:42:31] SPEAKER_01: And suppose maybe there's a journey we have to go on just to even understand.
[0:42:35] SPEAKER_01: I have unconscious beliefs that are running stuff.
[0:42:38] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_01: You know, I remember I had a friend who dated someone who's like, I don't believe in the
[0:42:43] SPEAKER_01: unconscious.
[0:42:44] SPEAKER_01: Like, I know everything I'm thinking and why I'm being motivated.
[0:42:47] SPEAKER_01: And it was like, whoa.
[0:42:48] SPEAKER_01: Danger, Will Rogers.
[0:42:51] SPEAKER_00: No, that's not true.
[0:42:54] SPEAKER_01: Seems untrue.
[0:42:56] SPEAKER_01: So there's that is probably an important phase in the process is to go holy moly.
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_01: I have all of these ideas about myself and reality.
[0:43:05] SPEAKER_01: And when I keep having them rise to the surface and explore them and I look at them, I'm
[0:43:09] SPEAKER_01: starting to see they're not true.
[0:43:11] SPEAKER_01: OK, so we do that.
[0:43:12] SPEAKER_01: And that's some of the turning towards.
[0:43:15] Unknown: Then, though, we get to a certain phase.
[0:43:18] SPEAKER_01: And some of you may recognize this phase.
[0:43:20] Unknown: We understand to the amount that we can understand.
[0:43:25] Unknown: Why we are how we are like we get our childhoods.
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_01: We've talked about them.
[0:43:30] SPEAKER_01: We can connect the dots like we understand.
[0:43:32] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I had an anxious mother and she did it with my father and my father and my sister.
[0:43:38] SPEAKER_01: And like we can lay it out.
[0:43:40] SPEAKER_01: OK, so we understand.
[0:43:44] SPEAKER_01: We've spoken about it.
[0:43:46] SPEAKER_01: We felt our feelings.
[0:43:47] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'm angry about that.
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_01: Look at that. I didn't know I was angry.
[0:43:50] SPEAKER_01: I am. Wow.
[0:43:51] SPEAKER_01: I can make some space for that.
[0:43:52] SPEAKER_01: I don't have to shut myself down.
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_01: Tremendous superhealing.
[0:43:57] SPEAKER_01: And then what?
[0:43:59] SPEAKER_01: And that's the place I think you and I were in, Brooke.
[0:44:03] SPEAKER_01: And I think a lot of people may find themselves in who listen to this show is that
[0:44:09] SPEAKER_01: you've done it. You have given yourself space to have feelings, even the ones that
[0:44:14] SPEAKER_01: were taboo in your family.
[0:44:16] SPEAKER_01: You kind of understand where you're at.
[0:44:18] SPEAKER_01: You know that not all your beliefs make sense.
[0:44:20] SPEAKER_01: You know they aren't true.
[0:44:22] SPEAKER_01: Like any of my self-deprecating beliefs, which I really don't have anymore.
[0:44:26] Unknown: But when they would run, it was like, I mean, come on, I know that like people don't
[0:44:31] SPEAKER_01: all hate me.
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_01: You can see it.
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_01: Notice you doing it and be hip to the fact that's not true.
[0:44:37] SPEAKER_01: That's not true.
[0:44:38] SPEAKER_01: And you see it.
[0:44:39] SPEAKER_01: And then what?
[0:44:41] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:44:41] SPEAKER_01: And then what?
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_01: And then you're still waking up with anxiety in the morning and then you're still
[0:44:46] SPEAKER_01: afraid every time someone doesn't answer your text message.
[0:44:49] SPEAKER_01: And then your body is still showing signs of immune deficiency because your nervous
[0:44:53] SPEAKER_01: system is caught in chronic survival mode.
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_01: This is really who we're talking to.
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:45:00] SPEAKER_01: It's all of you who've kind of done that, that beginning phase of something.
[0:45:06] SPEAKER_01: Let yourself have an experience.
[0:45:08] SPEAKER_01: Admit you have an emotion.
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_01: Feel your emotion.
[0:45:11] SPEAKER_01: Acknowledge it.
[0:45:12] SPEAKER_01: Wonder, huh, what's arising underneath this?
[0:45:16] SPEAKER_01: Could this be linked to something?
[0:45:17] SPEAKER_01: How did I become the person that I am?
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_01: Wonderful.
[0:45:21] SPEAKER_01: But now you're still waking up with anxiety.
[0:45:25] SPEAKER_01: You still think everyone hates you when they don't respond in text or you're still
[0:45:29] SPEAKER_01: angry or you're still yelling at your child and you can't stop yourself or, you
[0:45:35] SPEAKER_01: know, all of these things are still happening.
[0:45:38] Unknown: So that's the conversation we're having is when you've done those other things as
[0:45:43] SPEAKER_01: you and I have done and I'm sure many of you have done and then you're at the point
[0:45:49] SPEAKER_01: you and I reached and even in your awakening process and as you described, Brooke,
[0:45:53] SPEAKER_01: like almost your awakening process, kicking some more of it up for you.
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:45:58] SPEAKER_00: Getting pulled through the trauma loop because it's like, I know how this goes.
[0:46:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:46:04] SPEAKER_00: It's a big surprising thing.
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:46:08] SPEAKER_01: So that's what we're talking about.
[0:46:10] SPEAKER_01: What do you do?
[0:46:13] SPEAKER_01: And that's what I think we have to differentiate from turning towards yourself is a
[0:46:17] SPEAKER_01: beautiful thing.
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_01: And if you've never had your own back and you have never given yourself the space to
[0:46:22] SPEAKER_01: have a feeling and you've never felt your body and known like, ah, this is what it
[0:46:28] SPEAKER_01: feels like when sorrow exists in my being.
[0:46:31] SPEAKER_01: It shows up in my chest or in that tension.
[0:46:34] SPEAKER_01: It is a wonderful and beautiful thing.
[0:46:37] SPEAKER_01: But once you've done all that and you still find yourself stuck, then here's a few
[0:46:42] SPEAKER_01: other things you can do.
[0:46:43] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:46:44] SPEAKER_00: There's next level stuff to do.
[0:46:46] SPEAKER_00: And this is the heart of non-duality, right?
[0:46:48] SPEAKER_00: All of these things were not pinging and ponging.
[0:46:51] SPEAKER_00: Well, that was the wrong idea that we had.
[0:46:53] SPEAKER_00: So chuck that baby out with the bath water.
[0:46:56] SPEAKER_00: Now here's the right idea.
[0:46:57] SPEAKER_00: Like all these things exist.
[0:46:58] Unknown: All these things have profound healing potentials and are incredibly useful.
[0:47:04] SPEAKER_00: And what's the great quote?
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_00: I contain multitudes.
[0:47:07] SPEAKER_00: Like we all contain multitudes and there's a multitude of approaches to how we meet
[0:47:11] SPEAKER_00: ourselves.
[0:47:12] Unknown: It just depends on right, right person, right moment, right approach.
[0:47:17] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, I know that we're, we've been talking for a bit, so I just want to
[0:47:21] Unknown: make sure on that note to get to some of what was in the question, which was, is it
[0:47:29] Unknown: helpful to be able to contact fundamental consciousness or love or love?
[0:47:40] SPEAKER_00: Um, and many different teachers would use different words for this thing that I'm
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_00: using these words for right now, but could be used in different ways as we turn
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_00: towards.
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_00: And I think what's interesting is that we've heard this theme from different
[0:47:54] SPEAKER_00: teachers, you know, so I definitely noticed in Judith, I can't remember.
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_00: She said it in the conversation with us, but she definitely in her newest book,
[0:48:01] SPEAKER_00: trauma and the unbound body says.
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_00: You have to be able to contact fundamental consciousness first before you
[0:48:09] SPEAKER_00: start doing the unwind techniques.
[0:48:10] SPEAKER_00: And when we recorded with her and before we started the official recording, we
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_00: said, we'd like to do some kind of exercise.
[0:48:16] Unknown: And she said, let's not do the unwind because if people are doing this at home
[0:48:22] SPEAKER_00: on their own and they don't have access to fundamental consciousness yet, people
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_00: could get in a really bad way.
[0:48:28] SPEAKER_00: That's very astute.
[0:48:29] SPEAKER_00: Uh, Locke Kelly pointed this out in our conversation with him and talked about
[0:48:34] SPEAKER_00: how, you know, if people can't go, he used the term awake awareness.
[0:48:38] SPEAKER_00: If people don't know how to shift into awake awareness, this is where they get
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_00: into trouble.
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_00: And we hear about things like someone going on a nine day Vipassana meditation
[0:48:48] SPEAKER_00: retreat and they've never done anything like that.
[0:48:50] SPEAKER_00: And they don't know how to shift their awareness.
[0:48:54] SPEAKER_00: And then they're having psychotic breaks or they're going into a, you know,
[0:48:58] SPEAKER_00: getting triggered into a depression, a deep depression or whatever.
[0:49:02] Unknown: I think this is hugely important and it's also a massive cultural blind spot
[0:49:09] SPEAKER_00: because we don't talk about, we think we are objects.
[0:49:13] SPEAKER_00: We think we are running the show.
[0:49:15] Unknown: We don't get lessons in kindergarten about, although that's changing, there are
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_00: some good mindfulness programs getting rolled out these days, but like, how do
[0:49:25] SPEAKER_00: you be just aware?
[0:49:28] Unknown: You're just aware of aliveness.
[0:49:29] SPEAKER_00: You're aware that you're here right now.
[0:49:31] SPEAKER_00: You're aware of your breathing.
[0:49:33] SPEAKER_00: This can happen in many different ways.
[0:49:37] Unknown: If we can't really access that container.
[0:49:39] SPEAKER_00: And certainly I think Judith, because her work is about embodiment, I think she
[0:49:44] SPEAKER_00: does such a gorgeous, gorgeous job of leading people into that.
[0:49:50] Unknown: Then we already have an awareness of a much larger container than just us and
[0:49:56] SPEAKER_00: our loop.
[0:49:57] Unknown: It's already breaking the pattern of I am this and it goes this way and look at
[0:50:04] SPEAKER_00: this thing.
[0:50:05] SPEAKER_00: It's like, there's this whole other thing here, which is the space that I and the
[0:50:10] Unknown: world exist in.
[0:50:10] SPEAKER_00: Well then you're transcending the loop.
[0:50:12] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:50:13] Unknown: And it's like you and I, for lack of a good way of saying this, because y'all
[0:50:16] SPEAKER_01: remember, we're like co-learning with you, but for lack of a better way of saying
[0:50:21] SPEAKER_01: this, you're not just having the limbic system talk to the limbic system.
[0:50:24] SPEAKER_01: Like, Oh, hello, anger.
[0:50:26] SPEAKER_01: I meet you and I am actually fear in disguise.
[0:50:30] SPEAKER_01: You anger.
[0:50:31] SPEAKER_01: And wishing you would go away.
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_00: If you tell me, will you go away?
[0:50:35] SPEAKER_00: And then I will be able to have the kind of life I want because I'm afraid that
[0:50:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm doomed forever.
[0:50:42] Unknown: It's like you're actually transcending the state of brain that the limbic system
[0:50:48] SPEAKER_01: is running in.
[0:50:49] Unknown: Like the limbic system is running.
[0:50:51] SPEAKER_01: And a particular aspect of your brain.
[0:50:53] SPEAKER_01: And when you can connect with fundamental consciousness, you're shifting out of
[0:51:00] SPEAKER_01: that brain state and into another aspect of being.
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_01: Now you could just look at that neurobiologically.
[0:51:06] SPEAKER_01: Perhaps you're shifting into the frontal cortex, which is what a lot of the
[0:51:09] SPEAKER_01: meditation research shows.
[0:51:11] SPEAKER_01: You're in different areas of your frontal cortex where you can now feel compassion,
[0:51:17] SPEAKER_01: love and all of these different quote unquote transcendent states.
[0:51:22] Unknown: Or maybe you're completely in a transcendent God consciousness, whichever
[0:51:28] SPEAKER_01: way that you look at it.
[0:51:29] SPEAKER_01: I prefer the latter just because I prefer it, not because I think it's right.
[0:51:34] SPEAKER_01: But whichever way you look at it now, there's something turning towards it that's
[0:51:41] SPEAKER_01: different, so to speak.
[0:51:42] SPEAKER_01: You know, and you're not just looking at it.
[0:51:44] Unknown: So to speak, you know, like when Judith does her practices, she will have you
[0:51:53] Unknown: find these aspects of your body like you'll find really like the head center,
[0:52:00] SPEAKER_01: the heart center, the belly center.
[0:52:02] SPEAKER_01: You know, you'll find these aspects of your being, these energy centers.
[0:52:08] SPEAKER_01: And after she goes through this and she goes through a whole embodiment practice,
[0:52:12] SPEAKER_01: she has you find the space outside your body.
[0:52:15] SPEAKER_01: And then she says the space outside your body and the space inside your body are
[0:52:19] SPEAKER_01: one in the same space.
[0:52:20] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:52:21] SPEAKER_01: And she has you recognize that.
[0:52:22] SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm reading Joe Dispenza's book and he's talking about, I don't remember the
[0:52:27] SPEAKER_01: terms, but it's essentially like focal attention and then non-localized attention.
[0:52:33] SPEAKER_01: And he's talking about how when you go from focal attention, which is feel your
[0:52:37] SPEAKER_01: head center, right, to non-localized attention, which is feel the space in the
[0:52:42] SPEAKER_01: room and feel that the space in the room and you are one in the same, that you're
[0:52:46] Unknown: shifting your brain waves, that you're going from like, I might be misquoting,
[0:52:52] SPEAKER_01: but we'll put it, the book and the resources, you're going from beta to like
[0:52:57] SPEAKER_01: theta or alpha.
[0:52:59] SPEAKER_01: And so all of a sudden you're in this area where you can imagine and you can
[0:53:04] SPEAKER_01: create and anyone who does anything with kind of channeling or intuition or getting
[0:53:12] SPEAKER_01: messages that are beyond us, so to speak, your brain frequency always changes.
[0:53:18] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:53:18] SPEAKER_01: It's always a matter of like your actual brain frequency changes.
[0:53:23] SPEAKER_01: So I think what we can realize is a lot of times when we think of turning towards,
[0:53:30] SPEAKER_01: it's really like we haven't transcended the part of the brain that is looping.
[0:53:38] SPEAKER_01: And therefore we haven't transcended the fear or the anger or the blame shame
[0:53:43] SPEAKER_01: judgment zone.
[0:53:44] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:53:44] SPEAKER_01: We haven't stepped out of the ego into the soul if we were to use language of
[0:53:49] SPEAKER_01: Mat-Khons.
[0:53:51] SPEAKER_01: When we talk about turning with love, right, so even Annie, you had read the
[0:53:57] SPEAKER_01: beginning of her quote, Brooke, which was something like turning towards it with
[0:54:04] SPEAKER_01: understanding, compassion, self-love and empowerment.
[0:54:09] SPEAKER_01: She says a different emotional response and a different understanding of this
[0:54:12] SPEAKER_01: experience can be generated.
[0:54:15] Unknown: If we look at that neurobiologically, it means that when we're able to turn from
[0:54:22] SPEAKER_01: that state, which is a departure from the limbic brain, we can now gain a different
[0:54:28] SPEAKER_01: perspective because the limbic brain is defined by past associations.
[0:54:34] SPEAKER_01: So whenever it tries to make sense of data or interpret data or get perspective,
[0:54:39] SPEAKER_01: it's only able to do so through things it has seen and experienced in the past.
[0:54:44] SPEAKER_01: So there is no future.
[0:54:46] SPEAKER_01: It is only.
[0:54:48] SPEAKER_01: So you can't get a new perspective.
[0:54:50] SPEAKER_01: And if anything, it's just running it down those old loops.
[0:54:53] SPEAKER_01: You just may not recognize it like when you're having a dark night of the soul and
[0:54:56] SPEAKER_01: you're running down the old loops, but you didn't think you're running down the
[0:54:58] SPEAKER_01: old loops.
[0:54:59] SPEAKER_01: Nope.
[0:55:00] SPEAKER_01: You think you're running down a spiritual version of just what people go through
[0:55:04] SPEAKER_00: in the dark night.
[0:55:05] SPEAKER_00: People's lives fall apart.
[0:55:07] SPEAKER_00: That's how it goes.
[0:55:08] SPEAKER_01: What it is, right?
[0:55:09] SPEAKER_01: It's just terror, terror, terror.
[0:55:10] SPEAKER_01: And I say, you know, whatever.
[0:55:13] SPEAKER_01: So when you can actually experience love, and I think this is the whole
[0:55:18] SPEAKER_01: interesting bit, I've turned towards myself with love and found it tremendously
[0:55:23] SPEAKER_01: healing.
[0:55:24] SPEAKER_01: And even in the DNRS practices, there is some turning towards with love.
[0:55:30] SPEAKER_01: If you can enter a transcendent state, which if you felt it before, you can feel
[0:55:36] SPEAKER_01: it.
[0:55:36] SPEAKER_01: It's like you feel the same right.
[0:55:38] SPEAKER_01: Different in your brain.
[0:55:39] SPEAKER_01: Like my brain literally can feel different.
[0:55:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:55:42] SPEAKER_01: My body can feel different.
[0:55:44] Unknown: If you can turn towards yourself with tenderness, love, compassion.
[0:55:50] SPEAKER_01: Now you are in literally a different aspect of your brain.
[0:55:53] Unknown: So now you can get perspective.
[0:55:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:55:57] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:55:58] SPEAKER_01: Now you can understand, oh, precious, this isn't you.
[0:56:02] SPEAKER_01: This is a loop of your brain.
[0:56:04] SPEAKER_01: This is conditioning.
[0:56:06] Unknown: This is trauma, intergenerational or otherwise beloved.
[0:56:10] SPEAKER_01: You're whole.
[0:56:11] SPEAKER_01: You're well.
[0:56:11] SPEAKER_01: You're fine.
[0:56:12] SPEAKER_01: And now something new can be integrated.
[0:56:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:56:16] SPEAKER_00: And this all came up in our talk with Neelam too.
[0:56:19] SPEAKER_00: And she said tenderness and transcendence are one and the same.
[0:56:22] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, you can see how if you're able to access, just even really
[0:56:27] SPEAKER_00: genuinely access and experience tenderness, you cannot be in the limbic loop.
[0:56:31] Unknown: The limbic loop does not know how to do genuine tenderness and love.
[0:56:36] Unknown: The limbic loop does not know how to shift into being aware of fundamental
[0:56:43] SPEAKER_00: consciousness or awake awareness or whatever you want to call it.
[0:56:45] SPEAKER_00: So it's kind of fascinating.
[0:56:47] SPEAKER_00: I mean, this is one of those processes that's leading us and we can look at
[0:56:51] SPEAKER_00: every teacher we've talked to and see how they all discuss this.
[0:56:55] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:56:55] SPEAKER_00: Like they all discuss it in their own language.
[0:56:58] SPEAKER_00: Jeannie's Andy for sure.
[0:56:59] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:57:00] SPEAKER_00: Like that moment where in her dark night, she just had this epiphany of the voice
[0:57:05] SPEAKER_00: in her head, like you are not my friend.
[0:57:08] SPEAKER_00: And like, you can hear that story.
[0:57:09] SPEAKER_00: I remember hearing that story when I was in dark night and I was like, yeah,
[0:57:11] Unknown: well, I know it's not my friend, but that's different, right?
[0:57:15] SPEAKER_00: Like logically knowing I feel under siege is different than the epiphany of like,
[0:57:21] Unknown: oh, this isn't true.
[0:57:24] SPEAKER_01: You're just a brain program.
[0:57:26] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:57:26] SPEAKER_00: This you're just a loop.
[0:57:28] SPEAKER_01: Literally a brain program.
[0:57:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:57:30] SPEAKER_00: You're not a real thing.
[0:57:31] SPEAKER_00: None of this is true.
[0:57:32] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing here to heal.
[0:57:35] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing here to heal in the sense of understanding why my mind is
[0:57:41] SPEAKER_00: communicating with me in a mean way.
[0:57:43] SPEAKER_00: Like there's no nothing here to psychologically here heal.
[0:57:46] SPEAKER_00: It's time to create new habits.
[0:57:48] SPEAKER_00: And then this is where, you know, not to like cliffhanger it for people, but you
[0:57:53] SPEAKER_00: and I are deep in this process.
[0:57:55] Unknown: We're really inquiring about, I mean, first of all, we're both doing DNRS,
[0:58:01] SPEAKER_00: which is a six month, very intensive commitment.
[0:58:04] SPEAKER_00: So we're doing that.
[0:58:05] SPEAKER_00: And we've done lots of other things that we've reported on over time, but I feel
[0:58:10] SPEAKER_00: like that's the inquiry, right?
[0:58:12] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[0:58:13] Unknown: What are the most straightforward ways to shift our brain chemistry so that we can
[0:58:22] Unknown: even have access to these different experiences of consciousness by which I
[0:58:28] SPEAKER_00: don't necessarily mean things, although I would include that, but also just like,
[0:58:33] SPEAKER_00: Oh, the epiphany, the like landing in every cell of your body.
[0:58:39] SPEAKER_00: This isn't true.
[0:58:40] SPEAKER_00: I don't need to rehash this.
[0:58:41] SPEAKER_00: This is not happening right now.
[0:58:43] SPEAKER_00: Like the discovery over and over on deeper and deeper layers of the past is over.
[0:58:51] SPEAKER_00: That's a deep discovery for me.
[0:58:54] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:58:54] Unknown: It sounds silly, but really experiencing it's over.
[0:58:59] SPEAKER_01: So wired into your body.
[0:59:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:59:02] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:59:02] SPEAKER_01: That your past becomes biochemical.
[0:59:04] SPEAKER_01: It becomes electromagnetic.
[0:59:06] SPEAKER_01: It's like wired.
[0:59:08] SPEAKER_01: You and I loved it when Thomas Hubel said at the sand conference, like, you're not
[0:59:14] SPEAKER_01: living a future then there is no future until you get past this conditioning and
[0:59:19] SPEAKER_01: starting to recognize like, this is just conditioning, but it is in my brain.
[0:59:23] SPEAKER_01: It's in my fascia, right?
[0:59:25] SPEAKER_01: It's, it's stored in my body, but I am not my body only.
[0:59:30] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:59:30] SPEAKER_01: I am not only my body, right?
[0:59:33] SPEAKER_01: There's something other, and that's where some of the transcendence gets.
[0:59:36] SPEAKER_01: Like that's why I will never forget.
[0:59:38] SPEAKER_01: Mat Khan saying, you are the angel for this body.
[0:59:43] SPEAKER_01: There is a consciousness that is aware of all of this.
[0:59:48] SPEAKER_01: And it is the consciousness that can take the reins and start to lovingly and
[0:59:54] SPEAKER_01: intelligently and kindly support the body, the nervous system, the brain, the
[1:00:01] Unknown: fascia, the cells and re-imagining, re-experiencing something so beautiful.
[1:00:09] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, I've known this for so long.
[1:00:12] SPEAKER_01: I've always known, like, I've always been drawn to teachers who are talking about
[1:00:17] SPEAKER_01: actual tools, not just meditating and emptiness.
[1:00:20] SPEAKER_01: That's always been something that's kind of pulled me.
[1:00:24] SPEAKER_01: But putting it all together has never quite happened for me.
[1:00:28] SPEAKER_01: I kind of pieced a bunch of things.
[1:00:31] SPEAKER_01: I like DNRS and it works for me because of what I'm working with.
[1:00:35] SPEAKER_01: You know, maybe it's not for everybody and what they're working with, because
[1:00:39] SPEAKER_01: it's a complete system, right?
[1:00:41] SPEAKER_01: And that's lovely.
[1:00:42] SPEAKER_01: And so y'all can go look it up.
[1:00:44] SPEAKER_01: I think the complete system is so much easier than trying to create something on
[1:00:49] SPEAKER_01: your own and like recreate the wheel.
[1:00:51] SPEAKER_01: But other things you can do right now, even if you don't have a limbic
[1:00:55] SPEAKER_01: impairment and you just feel, man, I am way reactive and my brain is overactive
[1:01:01] SPEAKER_01: and my limbic system and my vagal tone is all off.
[1:01:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, my vagal tone is all lumpy.
[1:01:06] Unknown: My vagal tone is off.
[1:01:07] SPEAKER_01: I mean, a lot of people listen to liberated bodies.
[1:01:10] SPEAKER_00: They know.
[1:01:10] SPEAKER_01: So they feel like they literally are saying that.
[1:01:12] Unknown: They know what we're talking about.
[1:01:14] Unknown: And, you know, if that's the case, part of what DNRS is doing is practices that
[1:01:23] SPEAKER_01: promote a ton of positive neurochemistry, right?
[1:01:27] SPEAKER_01: Because it bathes the brain and nervous system in there is actual safety and joy,
[1:01:32] SPEAKER_01: right?
[1:01:33] SPEAKER_01: Which can start to turn off some of the alarm bells.
[1:01:36] Unknown: Heart math.
[1:01:38] SPEAKER_01: We've talked about heart math on the show before.
[1:01:41] SPEAKER_01: It is a great, easy biohack tool to support you in getting into your heart with your
[1:01:47] SPEAKER_01: meditation, because that actually gets your heart and brain into coherence and can
[1:01:53] SPEAKER_01: start to promote some of that positivity.
[1:01:56] SPEAKER_01: People talk about gratitude practices, and I love that.
[1:01:59] SPEAKER_01: It's just gratitude practice can be kind of vague.
[1:02:01] SPEAKER_01: Like, what does that mean?
[1:02:02] SPEAKER_01: It's not just writing in a journal.
[1:02:04] SPEAKER_01: It's so important.
[1:02:05] Unknown: It's so clear to me in doing all of this work that if you don't transcend your everyday
[1:02:12] SPEAKER_01: state, nothing really happens.
[1:02:14] SPEAKER_01: So it's not just I'm grateful for the trees.
[1:02:17] SPEAKER_01: Like, that's nice if you're writing it.
[1:02:18] SPEAKER_01: I'm sure it's pleasant.
[1:02:20] SPEAKER_01: But when we're talking about actually being alchemists to, like, update this whole body,
[1:02:26] SPEAKER_01: it really is like, I'm grateful for the trees.
[1:02:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
[1:02:31] SPEAKER_00: Like, I can't believe I get to live here with glorious trees.
[1:02:35] SPEAKER_00: And we exchange gases so we can each breathe and exist.
[1:02:40] SPEAKER_01: Yes. And it's like my heart feels like it's going to explode and I'm kind of weeping.
[1:02:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[1:02:46] SPEAKER_00: That's really felt gratitude for aliveness.
[1:02:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1:02:50] SPEAKER_01: It's very felt.
[1:02:52] SPEAKER_01: And then, of course, we spoke about it.
[1:02:54] SPEAKER_01: You know, I had a client who was like, hey, is this brightsiding?
[1:02:57] SPEAKER_01: You know, like, where do we differentiate?
[1:02:59] SPEAKER_01: Because, you know, a lot of what we talked about last time, we're not trying to turn
[1:03:03] SPEAKER_01: away from ourselves.
[1:03:05] Unknown: Like, who cares?
[1:03:06] SPEAKER_01: You're angry. Right.
[1:03:07] SPEAKER_00: You're allowed to have grief, sadness, heartache, anger, disappointment.
[1:03:11] SPEAKER_01: You're allowed to have the full range of emotions.
[1:03:14] SPEAKER_01: We're not snubbing ourselves.
[1:03:16] SPEAKER_01: What we're doing is getting really smart and savvy and starting to see when something
[1:03:21] SPEAKER_01: is just conditioning.
[1:03:23] SPEAKER_01: Right. So let's say something happens to someone I love tomorrow and I'm grieving.
[1:03:29] SPEAKER_01: That's not conditioning.
[1:03:30] SPEAKER_01: That's called human emotion.
[1:03:31] SPEAKER_01: And if I want to turn towards my grief and say, oh, Vanessa, make space for it, let it
[1:03:36] SPEAKER_01: be here.
[1:03:37] SPEAKER_01: That's turning towards.
[1:03:39] SPEAKER_01: But really, we start to get really savvy and go that voice that's like, oh, you don't
[1:03:45] SPEAKER_01: have a right to exist.
[1:03:46] SPEAKER_01: You'll never make money.
[1:03:47] SPEAKER_01: You'll never be happy.
[1:03:48] SPEAKER_01: Guess what?
[1:03:49] SPEAKER_01: That's not right.
[1:03:51] SPEAKER_01: That's not an adaptive experience.
[1:03:53] SPEAKER_01: That is a conditioned limbic loop.
[1:03:56] SPEAKER_01: And so that's what we're really talking about.
[1:03:58] SPEAKER_01: Now, if that comes up, if you can't get into a transcendent state to counter it with some
[1:04:03] SPEAKER_01: positive neurochemistry and brain frequency, well, what you're going to do is just shift
[1:04:09] SPEAKER_01: your attention to something else that's happening right now.
[1:04:11] SPEAKER_01: Besides that voice, it's really just understanding there's nothing wrong here other than loops
[1:04:18] SPEAKER_01: in my nervous system and brain.
[1:04:20] SPEAKER_01: And I don't have to make those neural wires thicker.
[1:04:23] SPEAKER_01: And that's when we're just turning away.
[1:04:26] SPEAKER_01: But it can look like we're bright side and like we're not looking at the pain.
[1:04:30] SPEAKER_01: We're not looking at the shadow.
[1:04:32] SPEAKER_01: You know, we may advise like, hey, if the news is your like stress chemistry junkie
[1:04:39] SPEAKER_01: move of choice, like don't watch it for six months while you rewire your brain.
[1:04:43] SPEAKER_01: It's like, isn't that bright side?
[1:04:45] SPEAKER_01: Well, you get to decide for yourself.
[1:04:48] SPEAKER_01: But it's really developing the discernment.
[1:04:52] SPEAKER_01: So we have to do this ourselves.
[1:04:54] SPEAKER_01: It's like Buddha always said, don't believe me, do for yourself.
[1:04:57] SPEAKER_01: Like, don't believe us.
[1:04:59] SPEAKER_01: Go and develop the discernment.
[1:05:01] SPEAKER_01: Get really curious between when you're having an adaptive, alive, emotional experience
[1:05:10] Unknown: that requires a real being with and making space for versus old trauma based,
[1:05:19] SPEAKER_01: intergenerational, outdated, unhealthy limbic conditioning loops.
[1:05:25] SPEAKER_01: Cause there it's clear to me most of the time, unless I'm in a really severe
[1:05:30] SPEAKER_01: limbic loop and then I can't tell anything.
[1:05:32] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[1:05:34] SPEAKER_00: Just think that'd be a great up, up side way to end the episode.
[1:05:38] SPEAKER_00: And then you can't tell anything.
[1:05:40] SPEAKER_00: Good luck.
[1:05:40] SPEAKER_00: Bye.
[1:05:42] SPEAKER_00: Then you're just in hell.
[1:05:45] SPEAKER_00: But I mean, for me, even just going, I'm in hell.
[1:05:50] SPEAKER_00: That's not just because life's hell.
[1:05:55] SPEAKER_00: Like you get so good at just being like, I'm in hell.
[1:05:57] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[1:05:58] SPEAKER_00: Tolerate hell.
[1:06:00] SPEAKER_00: No, that's a tip off.
[1:06:02] SPEAKER_00: There's a limbic loop at play here.
[1:06:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[1:06:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, pretty much.
[1:06:06] SPEAKER_01: Like if these things are happening, now I can see, and I don't know if I could see
[1:06:10] SPEAKER_01: before and I don't know if it's so obvious to everyone or not, but now I can
[1:06:14] SPEAKER_01: see, man, if I'm in that kind of thought process, if I have no hope, if I'm in
[1:06:19] SPEAKER_01: despair, if I'm in self hatred, shame, blame, judgment, all of those things,
[1:06:26] SPEAKER_00: it's a limbic loop.
[1:06:27] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1:06:27] SPEAKER_00: Which used to seem crazy to me.
[1:06:29] SPEAKER_00: And now it's so obvious.
[1:06:31] SPEAKER_00: It's so obvious.
[1:06:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1:06:33] SPEAKER_01: Then the more you see that, the more you're like, Oh, this isn't personal.
[1:06:36] SPEAKER_01: This is just what a human brain does when it's like all dysregulated and upside
[1:06:40] SPEAKER_01: down.
[1:06:41] SPEAKER_01: So let me get back to a place of coherence because then I can look at any
[1:06:47] SPEAKER_01: problem, any quandary.
[1:06:49] SPEAKER_01: Like if your question is, did I do the right thing or the wrong thing was, do I
[1:06:53] SPEAKER_01: have to make a different choice?
[1:06:55] SPEAKER_01: Did do I, should I talk to this person?
[1:06:57] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[1:06:57] SPEAKER_01: Cause we have real life problems we're trying to solve or real life issues that
[1:07:03] SPEAKER_01: arise.
[1:07:04] SPEAKER_01: Get to coherence and guess what?
[1:07:05] SPEAKER_01: It's going to clarify itself automatically.
[1:07:07] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[1:07:09] SPEAKER_00: Well, I can't think of a better way to end than that.
[1:07:12] Unknown: More on this in the future for sure.
[1:07:15] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[1:07:16] SPEAKER_01: Stay tuned for 2019, the year of tools for deconditioning.
