[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_00: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about being
[0:00:17] SPEAKER_00: on the embodied spiritual path. What does that actually mean? What is a real evolution
[0:00:23] SPEAKER_00: of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the
[0:00:29] SPEAKER_00: joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. And we'll be attempting
[0:00:35] SPEAKER_00: to sort that out for ourselves right here on the show. We're always so glad you're listening
[0:00:40] SPEAKER_00: in. In today's episode, we're talking about what I playfully call the bubble of pain,
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_00: aka a circular pattern of self-referencing that leaves us feeling at the center of a
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_00: very painful reality. Now, many of us have felt how much it hurts to take things personally.
[0:01:00] SPEAKER_00: Yet it seems even after recognizing the cost, we still find ourselves stuck, habitually believing
[0:01:07] SPEAKER_00: that everything is about us and oftentimes about how we're not enough. We're sharing lots of
[0:01:14] SPEAKER_00: personal experiences and ideas about how we get stuck in our own bubbles of pain and more importantly,
[0:01:19] Unknown: maybe how we can become more available and free. If you're enjoying the show, we'd be totally
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_00: delighted if you left a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. You can
[0:01:31] SPEAKER_00: also head over to blissandgrit.com and subscribe to hear updates on upcoming events that we have
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_00: on the way. And we actually have what sounds like it'll be like a master series where you can join
[0:01:46] SPEAKER_00: us in conversation post episodes coming soon. So go ahead and get on that list if that sounds
[0:01:51] SPEAKER_00: interesting. One last note before we head into the conversation, just in case you're new,
[0:01:56] SPEAKER_00: Brooke and I do have potty mouths, so if there are kids around, you may feel it's right to pop
[0:02:01] Unknown: some headphones in. Okay, here we go. Oh, hello, Brooke dear. Hello, my dear. Okay, well, I have no
[0:02:14] SPEAKER_00: idea how these words are going to come out of my mouth today. It's always the best way to go.
[0:02:18] Unknown: We're going to begin somewhere. We're going to begin. A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to
[0:02:23] Unknown: one of my clients who happens to also listen to the show. And I was explaining to her this concept
[0:02:31] Unknown: that I kind of came up with honestly for myself years ago, trying to understand my own pain and
[0:02:39] Unknown: how I showed up in relationship. And I call it the narcissistic bubble of pain. And as I was
[0:02:46] SPEAKER_00: breaking down the narcissistic bubble of pain to her, she was like, Oh my God, you have to do a
[0:02:51] Unknown: blessing grid episode on this. Okay, well, Shazam. So boo-yah. All right, the narcissistic bubble of
[0:02:59] SPEAKER_00: pain. I guess the terminology sort of like reveals me a little bit about my own like hard on myself
[0:03:08] SPEAKER_00: thing because I had to call it narcissistic because it has shock value. So I guess what it
[0:03:14] Unknown: boiled down to is we all have this way of what Chagiam Trungpa Rinpoche called self-referencing.
[0:03:24] SPEAKER_00: So, okay, let me bring it back. I'm in my late 20s and then my early 30s. And I'm doing this thing
[0:03:32] SPEAKER_00: in relationship to people, probably easiest for me to see in relationship to my ex-husband,
[0:03:39] Unknown: where everything that's happening is somehow about me, right? Like taking it personally would be one
[0:03:48] Unknown: kind of easy way to say it. But it's like, let's say someone doesn't call me back. It must be about
[0:03:57] SPEAKER_00: me. What did I do? What have I done? How come no one likes me? Why don't I have friends? Or,
[0:04:04] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, maybe my ex-husband didn't do something for Valentine's Day that I might have
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_00: fantasized he'd do and I'm what haven't I done? Am I not sexy enough? Am I not lovable enough?
[0:04:14] SPEAKER_00: Did I not give enough? Right? And so how I kind of conceptualized of it is like we have this bubble.
[0:04:23] SPEAKER_00: I see it like a beautiful soap bubble. It's very thin and it's kind of like porous, but it surrounds
[0:04:29] SPEAKER_00: us. And within it is all of our painful belief systems. I'm not enough. I'm not lovable enough.
[0:04:35] SPEAKER_00: No one will ever care about me the way I need. I won't get my needs met. And they bounce around
[0:04:41] Unknown: in the bubble, kind of like it's like an echo chamber. And so it's always this like self-referencing
[0:04:48] SPEAKER_00: and looping back and looping back like, oh, I didn't do good enough. And then I'm like, no,
[0:04:53] SPEAKER_00: fuck you. You're an asshole. You didn't do. And then I'm like, but you don't. And I'm never gonna,
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_00: and I'm always with an asshole. And it's always still me. And then I almost feel like as information
[0:05:03] SPEAKER_00: comes from the outside and it passes through the bubble, it becomes about me. So the information
[0:05:10] SPEAKER_00: from the outside could have been neutral data, you know, but it's always like getting translated
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_00: as if someone was like throwing an apple, but as it passed the barrier, it becomes an orange.
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_00: Totally.
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_00: Right? See, like, and even I could see it recently in another one of my clients,
[0:05:28] SPEAKER_00: like she was just giving an example. It was just like, oh, someone had said to her,
[0:05:33] Unknown: wow, I could see you being an excellent healthcare professional. You know, you're so,
[0:05:39] SPEAKER_00: and the way she took it was they didn't see her as excellent in her current profession. And then
[0:05:45] SPEAKER_00: maybe she's failing and you know, all of these things. And when I looked at it, we're like,
[0:05:49] Unknown: oh my God, or they meant you're such a caring, empathetic person. And as that apple got tossed
[0:05:58] SPEAKER_00: through her own pain body, it came out like a Clementine and she doesn't love Clementine.
[0:06:07] Unknown: So did I give enough information for you to respond to this? Is this making sense?
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_01: It is making great sense. I'm glad we're doing an episode on it. I still have zero idea what
[0:06:16] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to say, but I think this is super important. And I have certainly been
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_01: attending a lot to the concept of identity and how we identify, which is a part of this conversation.
[0:06:31] SPEAKER_01: And so it's like one of the things you're getting at, like I see it as two,
[0:06:35] Unknown: everyone loves a bullet point list, right? Two identifiers that allow the bubble to stay in
[0:06:42] Unknown: place. Like the first big, big one is I'm a person. Oh no. We got here. Shit.
[0:06:56] SPEAKER_01: And then the other one, which is not as large as that, it's smaller. It's a closer ring in,
[0:07:02] SPEAKER_01: closer to us, is I'm a person who is lacking something. And so it always gets translated
[0:07:12] SPEAKER_01: into a narrative of I'm not sexy enough. I'm not empathetic enough. They don't think that I'm
[0:07:17] SPEAKER_01: working hard enough because I'm not doing enough. Am I not doing enough? Why didn't my friends call
[0:07:22] Unknown: me back? Am I not likable enough? So there's two layers. I don't know how much we'll get into the,
[0:07:31] Unknown: I'm an individual person, but the- Well, I mean, it's a boot, it's the basis of Buddhism.
[0:07:38] SPEAKER_01: Exactly. Right. Like we're not this individual person that we identify as, like we are and we're
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_01: not, right? So nothing's all one way. We are and we're not. So we have these collections of stories
[0:07:52] SPEAKER_01: and experiences, and then we have all of our family lineages, collections of stories and
[0:07:57] SPEAKER_01: experiences, which they have like their bubble. We passed through their bubbles
[0:08:04] SPEAKER_01: and got imprinted with what their bubble was imprinted with. And then we formed our own
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_01: bubble based on our own narratives and our own experiences, which is obviously colored by their
[0:08:16] SPEAKER_01: bubbles. But it all relies on this larger concept that like I am my stories, I am my experiences,
[0:08:26] Unknown: I am what my parents said I was. I am what my family tree is. Like I'm a branch of it over here
[0:08:38] SPEAKER_01: and our family tree is this kind of a shape. And so I'm that kind of a shape. And the like,
[0:08:45] Unknown: I'm a person, I'm not a person is a very big one to let go of. And it gets conceptualized all over
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_01: the place. So I guess that's what I'm trying to say when I say, I don't know how much we're
[0:08:54] Unknown: going to get into. I don't want to just take a big conceptual-
[0:09:00] SPEAKER_00: Vomit up theorems.
[0:09:00] Unknown: Exactly. Hypotheses.
[0:09:04] SPEAKER_01: It's not what I want to do because it's not the kind of thing that can be
[0:09:09] SPEAKER_01: conceived of. Like people, lots of really beautiful teachers have pointed at this and
[0:09:14] SPEAKER_01: continue to, and we're pointing at it too. But at the end of the day, it's like,
[0:09:18] SPEAKER_01: at a certain point, you just shed enough layers that you start to get these little
[0:09:21] SPEAKER_01: glimpses of like, oh my God, like it's just a collection of thoughts and experiences,
[0:09:27] SPEAKER_01: none of which are happening right now. Holy shit. Which can pop the bubble, right? Like because
[0:09:34] SPEAKER_01: suddenly you're not always self-referencing. You're not always pointing everything back at
[0:09:41] Unknown: yourself and it doesn't need to line up and make sense along your narrative. So the example you
[0:09:48] Unknown: gave of the nothing for Valentine's Day, right? Like the narrative you have is not enough.
[0:09:59] SPEAKER_00: Well, if I was loved, someone would, and then he would get me, and then I would feel,
[0:10:05] SPEAKER_00: right? So it's like expectation after expectation after expectation.
[0:10:09] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So maybe expectation is a better word and a good word to dig into for this because
[0:10:14] SPEAKER_01: it just, that's where the filter goes automatically. I'm not enough because.
[0:10:20] Unknown: It is. It is expectation and it is attachment. So from a Buddhist concept, we get this higher
[0:10:28] SPEAKER_00: level of, as Brooke says, I'm not a person. Am I a person? Am I not a person? Which they would
[0:10:35] SPEAKER_00: just say is attachment to your individual ego, right? As opposed to recognizing interconnectedness.
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_00: That we're interconnected and that things are naturally and spontaneously arising.
[0:10:48] Unknown: But from that more simplistic level that you talked about about not enough,
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_00: that one seems to be really juicy and like something easy to dig into and relate to from
[0:10:58] SPEAKER_00: my own life experience, because I guess what happens is somewhere inside you feel deficient.
[0:11:06] Unknown: You know, not enough. I'm not good enough. I'm not worthy. And it's not enough.
[0:11:12] SPEAKER_00: You basically spend all of your ego energy, all of your bandwidth trying to shore up
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_00: that you are enough, right? And that's almost what creates that self-referencing bubble.
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_00: I, you know, I use the word narcissism, not because you're grandiose, but because you keep
[0:11:32] SPEAKER_00: self-reflecting. It's all a self-reflecting process. That's why they use self-referencing.
[0:11:39] SPEAKER_00: So it's almost like, well, if he got me something for Valentine's Day,
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_00: proving he loves me as I would expect love should look like, then I'm enough, right?
[0:11:50] SPEAKER_00: So I'm always searching for clues in my environment. I mean, maybe what we're talking
[0:11:55] SPEAKER_01: about is hypervigilance. Yeah. Well, it's a certain, it's a strain. It's a particular
[0:12:01] SPEAKER_01: flavor of hypervigilance. But what's interesting to recognize is that most of us have it.
[0:12:08] SPEAKER_00: I do think so. I do think so. And it's like the stupidest and simplest examples I usually give to,
[0:12:15] SPEAKER_00: like when I talk to clients and I'm talking about this concept and, you know, I always use myself as
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_00: as the example. It's so stupid. But when I was in grad school and I'm walking down the hallways and
[0:12:25] SPEAKER_00: there's this woman I really liked and we were friends, but not like besties, but friends.
[0:12:31] SPEAKER_00: So it's still a little in that insecure phase where it's like, do you like me as much as I like
[0:12:35] SPEAKER_00: you? And, you know, we're not sure. And I looked up at her and she caught my eye and I gave her one
[0:12:42] SPEAKER_00: of those big beaming, goofy Vanessa hellos, like my smile, like a horse and I'm waving.
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_00: And she kind of like looked at me and then just looked away. And I remember in that moment, you
[0:12:56] SPEAKER_00: know, like all the thoughts pinging, what did I do? Does she not like me? You know, oh, how
[0:13:01] Unknown: embarrassing. Like, and it was all looping. And I caught later that never once did I think,
[0:13:08] SPEAKER_00: oh my God, is she okay? Like what happened to my friend? Why would my friend who's this,
[0:13:14] SPEAKER_00: you know, lovely person not say hi to me? Did something happen to her family? Is she sick?
[0:13:21] SPEAKER_00: Right. It was never about putting myself in the other person's shoes because this particular
[0:13:28] SPEAKER_00: style of what we could call pain body, but I think the bubble just gives such a good illusion,
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_00: is so loud. It's like I'm in an echo chamber of my own fears and my own beliefs. And I'm
[0:13:42] SPEAKER_00: desperate to shore up my identity as okay. Right. So it's like, am I not enough? And then,
[0:13:48] SPEAKER_00: and then they have to become bad because like, how dare that bitch, you know, like it must be,
[0:13:53] SPEAKER_00: she's bad. Right. And then no, it's really me. And it's like all pinging in this bubble. And
[0:13:59] SPEAKER_00: that bubble itself kind of prevented me from making contact with direct experience, right?
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_00: From making contact with reality. Most assuredly, I was not embodied. Right. Wasn't like I was in
[0:14:13] SPEAKER_00: my body going, hmm, how does that feel? Right. Feel like my friend's okay. Does it feel like,
[0:14:20] Unknown: have I done, you know, so I think you're right. When you point to those two different levels
[0:14:26] SPEAKER_00: of differentiation, it's like at the highest level, the most formless level, like, ha,
[0:14:31] Unknown: you're not even a separate self. So it's hilarious. Right. And at our most, like accessible level of
[0:14:38] Unknown: experience as beings with form and psychologies, it's like, we're so busy shoring ourselves up that
[0:14:46] Unknown: we can't connect. And in psychology, they talk about intersubjectivity. Have we talked about
[0:14:55] SPEAKER_00: that term? Do I ever talk about that with you? It's pretty interesting because it's considered
[0:15:00] SPEAKER_00: a maturational level of development if you can achieve intersubjectivity, which is a long word
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_00: for saying, recognizing that the other people in front of you are subjective beings, not objects.
[0:15:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry. I just think we're so funny. Yes. Okay. We are so funny because when we're in that bubble,
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_00: they are more like objects because everything about them is in reference to me. Are they
[0:15:29] SPEAKER_00: responding the way I need them to do? They like what I like. Do they want what I want? Are they
[0:15:33] SPEAKER_00: doing what I think a good husband should do or a good friend should do? And it's like, okay, here's
[0:15:40] Unknown: my other stupid example of this. When I was younger and I was married to my ex-husband,
[0:15:47] Unknown: I wanted to buy a house. He didn't really. He didn't really like it. He said he wanted to
[0:15:53] SPEAKER_00: live in some small janky apartment like he kind of always had. And he liked to keep a really low
[0:15:58] SPEAKER_00: overhead, even though he wasn't cheap. He spent his money, but he kind of liked his like base nut
[0:16:04] Unknown: to always be like super duper easy. And what I thought to myself was he just doesn't know he
[0:16:10] SPEAKER_01: wants a house. I don't think you're the first person in the world to do the, I don't think he
[0:16:16] Unknown: knows he wants what I want. I mean, because surely. I just have to show him that he wants what I want.
[0:16:25] SPEAKER_00: Because any human being would want what I want. Because what I want is delightful.
[0:16:30] SPEAKER_00: Is the best. It's the most important. Yes.
[0:16:33] SPEAKER_00: And he must've just been wounded and just never realized that a house was available to him where
[0:16:41] SPEAKER_00: he's scared. All those things that we tell stories, women do it about men the most. But all those
[0:16:47] SPEAKER_00: stories that we tell about someone, now that movement is objectifying him, imagining him
[0:16:53] SPEAKER_00: to think and feel and want and prefer as I think and feel and want and prefer. When someone deviates
[0:16:59] Unknown: from that, you think they're pathological. Like, well, what's the matter? Maybe they're just scared.
[0:17:04] SPEAKER_00: Maybe they have a wound from their past. Maybe it's a pain body. Rather than imagining that they have
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_00: a subjective experience that's just very different and there's a different movement kind of inside of
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_00: them that's authentic. So when you're in that bubble of pain, it's like that. It's like you're
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_00: not able to really see and feel and connect with the inner subjectivity of that other person
[0:17:29] SPEAKER_00: because you're stuck in this whirlwind of me.
[0:17:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that I'm so glad that we're doing recording this one now because I feel like it
[0:17:40] SPEAKER_01: plugs in really nicely to the holding space for not knowing. Because you're talking about,
[0:17:48] SPEAKER_01: the way that you talk about people as objects, that's when the label narcissistic becomes useful.
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_01: It's not like we're defining ourselves as NPD. I think it's very important that people know
[0:17:57] SPEAKER_01: that's a real thing and it's a really different than this.
[0:18:00] SPEAKER_01: Yes, than I'm being a little slip.
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_01: Right, right. But there is this large gray scale of narcissism that we all exist on. One of the ways
[0:18:08] SPEAKER_01: is that we think we're people. So, okay, so most of us have some of it because almost all of us
[0:18:13] SPEAKER_01: feel that way. Right. I think I'm a me. And then people can turn into objects because of it. And
[0:18:22] SPEAKER_01: that episode we just did on holding space for not knowing is an important part of it.
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_01: It's an important part of unhooking from it because, again, everything moves really fast.
[0:18:33] SPEAKER_01: Conditioning moves very quickly along the coding program that has been written. And so,
[0:18:40] SPEAKER_01: one of the ways of slowing it down when we don't catch like, oh, I'm in the bubble. I'm
[0:18:47] Unknown: making everything about me is just holding space for not knowing. So, first it's like the somatic
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_01: feeling of like in the example you gave of walking down the hallway and this friend does not greet
[0:18:57] SPEAKER_01: you. It's the feeling of like, oh, like probably kind of gut punch, solar plexus punch let down.
[0:19:05] SPEAKER_01: And then what did I do wrong? Maybe they don't like me. I thought we were going to be friends.
[0:19:08] SPEAKER_01: All the stories start running. And a nice little thing to interject, I feel like almost even before
[0:19:14] SPEAKER_01: you catch that you are self-referencing everything to death is to hold space for not knowing. Just to
[0:19:22] Unknown: like infuse that into the air a little bit of like, I don't know. Like you were saying, maybe she's
[0:19:31] SPEAKER_01: having a terrible day. I wonder if she's okay. Maybe she was so caught up in her thoughts or
[0:19:36] SPEAKER_01: didn't sleep well last night that she just literally didn't even see me. I don't know.
[0:19:40] SPEAKER_01: And I feel like that's just a handy tool. Certainly I do it with my son a lot because he's 10 and like
[0:19:47] SPEAKER_01: that's, he's starting to, he's on that tweener stage where you start to come up more and more
[0:19:52] Unknown: about like, it's fairly black and white thinking, right? So, we'll be driving the car and someone
[0:19:59] SPEAKER_01: will cut us off and be like, I can't believe they did that. Right? And so, I feel like that's
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_01: so simple. And I'm like, yeah, that was scary first. Second, like we don't know what they did.
[0:20:14] Unknown: We don't, it certainly wasn't, ah ha ha. I see them in that Prius. I'm going to cut them off.
[0:20:22] SPEAKER_01: Like it certainly wasn't intentional. I wouldn't use this many words when talking with him, but
[0:20:27] SPEAKER_01: I'm basically trying to point out like, God, maybe they had a really horrible, maybe they were up in
[0:20:33] SPEAKER_01: the hospital all night last night with someone they love. I wouldn't also use something so dark
[0:20:36] SPEAKER_01: with him as an example, but like, and they have not slept well. I don't know that person in that
[0:20:41] SPEAKER_01: car pod that I didn't see and have never met and who cut me off. I have-
[0:20:45] SPEAKER_01: Maybe there was a bee swarming them at the steering wheel.
[0:20:49] SPEAKER_01: Maybe they were just changing the radio station and it's nothing personal and who cares because
[0:20:52] SPEAKER_01: we didn't have a car accident. But I have found that for me as a 42 year old person and for him
[0:21:00] SPEAKER_01: as a 10 year old person, like it's very handy for us to have these conversations about not knowing
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_01: about in reference to other people when we are creating the self-referencing bubble. Like
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_01: maybe it's not about you, you know, or certainly if you're dealing with challenging personalities
[0:21:16] SPEAKER_01: at school or something, right? It's like, we don't know. We don't know what they're dealing with,
[0:21:20] SPEAKER_01: which does not mean you need to be their buddy or make it better. It just means you get to not know
[0:21:25] SPEAKER_01: and not make it about you. Like, oh, this is about me.
[0:21:28] SPEAKER_00: Isn't it just the worst to make it about you? I mean, I'm not in a judgmental sense,
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_00: in a sense of it's fucking painful. Right. And we do it when everything's about you.
[0:21:36] SPEAKER_00: It's one of the ways we just make all our suffering. Yeah.
[0:21:38] SPEAKER_01: Oh God. When the weight of the world rests on your shoulders because you're not enough.
[0:21:45] SPEAKER_00: Right. Then we wonder why everyone has like trap tightness and soreness. It's like,
[0:21:50] SPEAKER_00: everybody's like, I know I'm not alone in it. We're piling it on. You know, this is just like
[0:21:56] Unknown: a jump away from codependency, right? Because if my mom's, okay, this is right after Easter.
[0:22:05] Unknown: Vanessa and I are both feeling a little post Easter familial.
[0:22:12] Unknown: We both just spent a week with our beautiful families. And so let's say my mom's, you know,
[0:22:19] Unknown: okay, here's the simplest of examples. My mom's a very good cook. And that makes her very fussy
[0:22:28] SPEAKER_00: when she goes to restaurants. So it was like, we go to the restaurant the first night and it's
[0:22:33] SPEAKER_00: Italian. And I can't even really eat Italian food anymore. So like, but I brought them because I
[0:22:39] SPEAKER_00: have like kids to worry about. My mom's very fussy and my diet, whatever, we go to this Italian
[0:22:44] Unknown: restaurant. She takes a bite and she's like, oh, my mom's got the worst poker face in the history.
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_00: So she's like, like, you could just see she hates what's happening right now. Oh, this octopus.
[0:23:00] SPEAKER_00: Now, my mom doesn't like the food. Okay, that's a very simple fact, right? But in my mind, it's like,
[0:23:08] SPEAKER_00: she doesn't like Austin. She's mad because I moved from Miami to Austin. I didn't do a good enough
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_00: job of sightseeing. I didn't set up the restaurants, right? I'm not a good enough daughter,
[0:23:19] Unknown: right? Like, there's these like, almost like, like if her to the food could make an echo in like a
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_00: cave, it's bouncing back with all of these like other voices, right, which is really how a pain
[0:23:34] SPEAKER_00: body kind of looks and feels. And it's all just like pinging around. Now I was able because,
[0:23:41] SPEAKER_00: thank God, I've released a lot of this kind of activity, I was able to just take a breath and
[0:23:45] Unknown: be like, she doesn't like her food. Right. And I don't know why. And then maybe all of those
[0:23:51] SPEAKER_00: things are involved. And it doesn't matter. It's certainly not that I'm a bad daughter that she
[0:23:55] Unknown: doesn't like her food. But, you know, it was these little, little pings. But part of why I even talk
[0:24:03] SPEAKER_00: about this concept, one is to understand ourselves, like to understand that echo chamber. But the other
[0:24:08] Unknown: is to understand them. Because my mom also has a very dense bubble and spent most of the week.
[0:24:17] Unknown: She's like defending herself against something that no one ever
[0:24:22] SPEAKER_00: was talking about or attacking her for. Like, you know, that kind of thing where she's like,
[0:24:28] SPEAKER_00: you know, I had a right to worry about that. And you're like, Oh, wait, what are you talking about?
[0:24:32] SPEAKER_00: Like, I didn't tell you, you don't have a right to worry about that. You know, it's like,
[0:24:36] Unknown: and it's constant. And then, you know, you get annoyed or frustrated, I get annoyed or frustrated
[0:24:43] SPEAKER_00: very easily in those moments. And it's been years of me having to realize, like, she's just stuck in
[0:24:50] SPEAKER_00: her own bubble of pain. And she can't hear me and she can't see me. And that oranges and throwing her
[0:24:57] Unknown: are coming out as lines. And that's just part of what's happening. And it doesn't mean she doesn't
[0:25:05] SPEAKER_00: love me. It doesn't mean she doesn't value me. It doesn't mean all sorts of things I could fill
[0:25:09] SPEAKER_00: it in as it's just she's stuck in her own pain bodies. And it's circulating. And the air is so
[0:25:18] SPEAKER_01: stale in there, isn't it? Yeah. And when you started talking about that with your mom, like I started
[0:25:24] SPEAKER_01: crying, which means it's juicy to talk about because it is like it's so we can have a
[0:25:29] SPEAKER_01: narcissistic pain bubble about deconstructing the narcissistic pain bubble, right? Like, isn't it so
[0:25:34] Unknown: interesting that I can see this about myself? But when we talk about it in relationship to the people
[0:25:40] Unknown: that we love, it lets it's funny, like it lets us love them more in a funny way, or our love can,
[0:25:49] SPEAKER_01: which is already there. It's not like it's a bigger quantity, but it's that it can shine through more.
[0:25:55] Unknown: And at the exact same time, it shines through more because you realize you don't get to do
[0:26:02] SPEAKER_01: anything about it. Like you don't you can't, right, you can't pop their bubble, you can't fix
[0:26:09] Unknown: it for them. You can't make sure that they get the translation the way it was intended. And I spent a
[0:26:16] SPEAKER_01: lot of my week watching the bubbles. I'm so glad we're talking about this because it was so on my
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_01: mind and with my mom, hi, she doesn't listen, but
[0:26:31] SPEAKER_01: there was this one of my mom's very, very dense pain bubbles is if I'm not
[0:26:39] SPEAKER_01: helping and if I'm not needed, I don't exist. And I'm a terrible waste of space.
[0:26:47] Unknown: And watching her about everything, it's really funny. It's hilarious. And it's hilarious in myself
[0:26:57] SPEAKER_01: too, right, because people can try so hard to help that what they wind up doing if it's not in
[0:27:04] SPEAKER_01: alignment, which it's not if it's coming from pain, is they create all kinds of extra static,
[0:27:10] Unknown: all kinds of chaos and irritation. It's not at all helpful, but they think they're being helpful.
[0:27:18] SPEAKER_01: It's really funny to watch. So like a simple one, so funny, my brother and sister-in-law live down
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_01: the street from a beach, Alki beach in Seattle, where they have tons of beach volleyball. It's
[0:27:29] SPEAKER_01: like the only part of Seattle that has this funny Southern California beach culture in gloomy Seattle.
[0:27:35] SPEAKER_01: And my mom decides they're going to get into beach volleyball. They don't play volleyball.
[0:27:40] SPEAKER_01: They're going to because how awesome they live a block from beach volleyball.
[0:27:45] SPEAKER_01: So, and my mom's not at all athletic or inclined this way, but she just has this vision, right,
[0:27:50] Unknown: of their amazing lives playing beach volleyball because their new house. Yeah. So she starts
[0:27:58] SPEAKER_01: figuring out, you know, what, how do you rent the balls and what are the leagues and what are your
[0:28:04] SPEAKER_01: friends? What friends might you get engaged in this? They have no interest in playing beach
[0:28:08] SPEAKER_01: volleyball, either one of them. It's not like they've thrown her a bone like, oh, I wonder where you
[0:28:11] SPEAKER_01: do get the balls. Like it's not that. And then I see her later. We run into a friend of my sister-in-law's
[0:28:18] SPEAKER_01: who's also not a beach volleyball player. My mom takes her aside. You know, they do beach volleyball
[0:28:23] SPEAKER_01: here and we're like standing right in front of the nets. It would be so fun. Don't you think it
[0:28:26] SPEAKER_01: would be fun? Maybe you could get together with them. Maybe you could all do beach volleyball.
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_01: And I'm just watching it, you know. Now in the past, I would want to intervene. I would want to
[0:28:36] SPEAKER_01: intervene in a way that makes my brother and sister-in-law and my sister-in-law's friend feel
[0:28:40] Unknown: better because get them off, get her off their back from the controlling, the puppeteering.
[0:28:48] SPEAKER_01: And then I would also want my mom to feel better. Like, gee, you really are. Because all she needs
[0:28:53] SPEAKER_01: to feel to feel like she's alive is I'm helping. Isn't it great? Like she wants to be the one that
[0:29:00] SPEAKER_01: ignites their new passion in beach volleyball. I did this. I helped you connect to this, right?
[0:29:05] Unknown: So crazy. And it's of course not helpful because it's agitation for everyone, including my mother,
[0:29:13] SPEAKER_01: because the agitation is trying to make a thing happen that nobody wants to have happen.
[0:29:18] SPEAKER_00: Well, and moving from pain is just agitating.
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_01: It's just pain, right? Like she's just reinforcing the echo in her cave is saying,
[0:29:27] SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to help. And then it says all these other things. Why doesn't anyone ever listen to
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_01: me? I have good ideas. I'm trying to help. Nobody ever lets me help. You know, all these things.
[0:29:36] SPEAKER_01: Right. No one's appreciating it.
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_01: And so in the moments when I can watch it and just watch it, I have so much love for her. It's like
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: my heart breaks wide open. I get past the point of being annoyed and maddened by her puppeteering
[0:29:53] SPEAKER_01: type codependent helper thing. And I'm just like, Oh my God, it is so painful to live in that
[0:30:02] SPEAKER_01: shaped bubble, you know, that has that sound reverberating around. Like you said, the air is
[0:30:07] SPEAKER_01: so stale and there and you want, you love this person and you know that they, like you and everyone
[0:30:14] SPEAKER_01: on the planet are just made of basic goodness. They don't have to earn their right to exist.
[0:30:20] SPEAKER_01: They're here. So they are loved. They're here. So they are good already. They don't have to do
[0:30:27] SPEAKER_01: anything to earn their place, but they're endlessly trying to earn their place and
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_01: adapt to what it sounds like in the bubble by manipulating things. But it doesn't work that way
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_01: because you got to let go of the reins for anything to start to sound different and for
[0:30:39] SPEAKER_01: the bubble to pop. And so it's like, I can move towards her with all of this love because I see it
[0:30:47] Unknown: in her because I see it in myself and I see how beautifully fucking hilarious it is that we think
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_01: we're doing something when we try to manipulate circumstances from pain.
[0:31:02] SPEAKER_01: We're not, we're just adding more noise to an already noisy place, you know?
[0:31:08] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for sure. I mean, even just like watching myself this week,
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_00: I was exhausted. I mean, I had a really great week, but I was exhausted and I realized like,
[0:31:21] SPEAKER_00: I wasn't exhausted really just from the amount of physical activity we were doing. I'm still
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_00: a bit recovering. So, you know, like I watched, I watched what I output on a regular basis,
[0:31:31] SPEAKER_00: but it wasn't really that. It was like, I was exhausted from worrying about making everybody
[0:31:36] SPEAKER_00: happy and like, is everyone having a good time? Like this kind of maniacal drive that is one of
[0:31:44] SPEAKER_00: my pain bodies. And so we have a lot of empathy, a lot of compassion for it.
[0:31:51] SPEAKER_00: I feel the same way as what you were saying, Brooke. And I guess though, where it's the most
[0:31:55] Unknown: challenging for me when I see it in someone else is I can have compassion and then I still want
[0:32:04] Unknown: to fix it desperately, you know? And that's the biggest challenge I face.
[0:32:11] Unknown: One of the things that's been challenging for me is what's left in the place of not fixing,
[0:32:18] SPEAKER_01: right? Cause I'm a fixer too. I'm my mother's daughter. Yeah, compassion, but now like
[0:32:23] SPEAKER_00: fifth time, sixth time. Oh Jesus, now what? I know. Well, this is probably, you know, fodder
[0:32:29] SPEAKER_01: for another episode, but what I, well, it's getting used to feeling different inside of
[0:32:35] SPEAKER_01: your own skin to having a different response to conditioning, which feels incredibly foreign
[0:32:42] Unknown: from what you would normally do. So for me in the beginning, it's a lot of, not much, right? Like
[0:32:51] SPEAKER_01: it's a lot of just witnessing and compassion. I don't get to, like in the example of my mother,
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_01: I don't get to move towards if there's no space for me to move towards. And there is no space
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_01: for me to move towards. With a friend or somebody else who comes to me and says, you know,
[0:33:14] Unknown: I'm heartbroken. This is what's going on in my life. There's all this room to move towards,
[0:33:19] SPEAKER_01: not to fix, but to move towards where we can engage and literally just have a loving,
[0:33:25] Unknown: I was going to say conversation doesn't even need to be words though, a loving time together where
[0:33:34] SPEAKER_01: I get to love them and they get to feel loved and they get to love me at the end. And that takes
[0:33:38] SPEAKER_01: whatever form it takes in terms of what words are spoken or what words are not spoken. But
[0:33:44] SPEAKER_01: when a person is in a very dense bubble, you know, very thick condition space, and certainly if we've
[0:33:51] SPEAKER_01: been running our programming without any attempt to disrupt it for 70 years, you know, those programs,
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_01: it intensifies. And I watch, you know, one of the reasons why I'm on this path,
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_01: honestly, is watching my parents and my parents' friends who I grew up to kind of close. Like I,
[0:34:10] SPEAKER_01: so I watched them grow up and also just because that's sort of my nature. And just watching them
[0:34:16] SPEAKER_01: harden into their harder aspects of themselves and all of the other more subtle, more nuanced,
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_01: more alive, more loving, more delighted, more joyful parts have kind of gone away. And it's almost like
[0:34:30] SPEAKER_01: just the deepest ridges are left and that tends to be the harder, more painful conditioning.
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: So it is challenging because it's like I can see and I can see that I don't get to manipulate
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_01: anything and I love you because I have so much empathy and compassion. And also like, okay,
[0:34:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm this stranger in a strange land where I'm not the person who used to rush in to try and
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_01: change the way your bubble sounded because I know that I can't. Right. Well, that was just your
[0:34:59] SPEAKER_00: self-referencing bubble bumping up against her self-referencing bubble. And we're both not
[0:35:05] Unknown: connecting in real space and time. Right. Yeah. We're like in the past, we're in the future,
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_00: but we're not connecting in real space and time because the direct experience would just be
[0:35:16] SPEAKER_00: compassion. Right. Maybe there's sadness, maybe you'll have a direct experience of anger,
[0:35:21] SPEAKER_00: but that too would pass if you were letting go of whatever belief systems were driving it.
[0:35:26] Unknown: Right. I think like, so what happened for me was I went to grad school for psychology.
[0:35:35] Unknown: I started to learn about these ideas. I started to learn about these ideas in
[0:35:44] SPEAKER_00: my couples counseling class where we started to talk about intersubjectivity. I'm like,
[0:35:49] SPEAKER_00: oh my God, I had this epiphany. I was making this poor man get a house when he didn't want a house.
[0:35:54] SPEAKER_00: Right. And once that awareness kind of got planted, it started to grow. I started to observe.
[0:36:01] Unknown: And then I don't know, I just stopped taking things so personally. Right. And I was doing
[0:36:10] SPEAKER_00: therapy and I was doing awareness practices and all those other things. What I've noticed when I
[0:36:15] Unknown: work with people is something very similar. It's like, if this is part of their patterning,
[0:36:22] Unknown: if they're caught in their own bubble, they come in and everything that's up in their lives they
[0:36:29] SPEAKER_00: think has to do with them. If their career is not right, if their money is not right.
[0:36:34] SPEAKER_00: The funny thing is, of course, to some degree it does have to do with us,
[0:36:37] SPEAKER_00: but then again, it doesn't. It's always the both. Yeah.
[0:36:41] SPEAKER_00: Like, we do create our own realities. But again, not everything is about you,
[0:36:47] SPEAKER_00: this solid ego identity that you think yourself to be. Right. In fact, I think
[0:36:54] Unknown: the narcissistic bubble of pain, I dare say, is probably a dissociated, disembodied aspect of
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_00: self that lives mostly in a cognitive realm. It's like it's only really living in the
[0:37:07] SPEAKER_00: realm of theory and idea and story. Well said. I want you to drop a mic after that one.
[0:37:12] Unknown: Boom. Yeah. Sorry, I just screamed in all of your ears.
[0:37:18] Unknown: Worth it. Got excited.
[0:37:21] Unknown: Um, so I think like I start to notice they come in and they're talking about their friends and
[0:37:29] SPEAKER_00: they're talking about their family and they're really it's like, I'm not getting enough from
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_00: them. My needs aren't getting that. My mom's not recognizing my restaurant choice and the foods.
[0:37:39] Unknown: And it's all these kinds of stories. And then somehow organically, we don't even really focus
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_00: on this. All of a sudden they're telling me stories differently. My friend didn't call me
[0:37:51] SPEAKER_00: back. And I was wondering what could have happened to her. I feel so bad for people. People are going
[0:37:56] SPEAKER_00: through so much these days. And it's like this beautiful organic shift that happens where all
[0:38:05] SPEAKER_00: of a sudden they're released from that prison of taking things so personally. And, you know, to be
[0:38:12] SPEAKER_00: really clear about it, there's probably levels. Like you talked about thicker bubbles and thinner
[0:38:17] SPEAKER_00: bubbles. Like it's not like enlightened. I'm not a person and I don't reference myself.
[0:38:24] SPEAKER_00: We don't need to go all the way out there. Yeah.
[0:38:26] Unknown: I still reference myself plenty, but it's like greater and greater levels of freedom,
[0:38:32] SPEAKER_00: like as if the bubble's getting larger and larger and there's more space for other people and other
[0:38:38] Unknown: direct experience. And so I don't know. You know, I always talk a lot about, I feel like
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_00: the moment we believe we get space to exist, kind of like what you were describing, like you don't
[0:38:51] Unknown: have to earn your right to be here. You know, my conditioning was very thick around having to earn
[0:38:56] Unknown: my right to be here. So this is also kind of my lens. But when you work with someone, a significant
[0:39:04] SPEAKER_00: other, whether it's rolfing or energy work or coaching or whatever it is, therapy,
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_00: and you have space to exist. And then you in that movement, make more space for yourself. Like you
[0:39:16] SPEAKER_00: start to become aware, you give space to your feelings, you pay attention to yourself, that
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_00: that alone is sort of the alchemical agent. Maybe then you become a little more present, a little
[0:39:28] SPEAKER_00: more in your body. And then maybe you're touching reality in a little bit more of a direct way.
[0:39:33] SPEAKER_00: And then maybe as that happens, you just stop self referencing to the degree that you were,
[0:39:38] Unknown: and you stop personalizing in relative degrees. I don't know, does that make sense to you? It's
[0:39:45] SPEAKER_00: like I've observed the process. I just don't know how it's to be honest. And I think that once
[0:39:50] SPEAKER_01: people become more subjects than objects, like as this alchemical process takes place,
[0:39:57] SPEAKER_01: and you start to realize that that non dualistic thing again of like, it's actually,
[0:40:05] SPEAKER_01: if you just hold space for the possibility, maybe it's not about you, you realize it's actually
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_01: never about you. And also it is sometimes. No, but like in this particular example,
[0:40:18] SPEAKER_01: people are going to see us through their own lenses, which we don't get to control
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: or manipulate. So we're going to be whatever we need to pop up as for them in that particular
[0:40:30] SPEAKER_01: moment, whether it's the selfish bitch or the head in the clouds, I wish they were less out of it.
[0:40:36] Unknown: Who knows? So I'm not saying that this means we get to like get off the hook for being
[0:40:43] Unknown: assholes. Certainly patterns of how people behave around us allows for a reflection back
[0:40:51] SPEAKER_01: where we're looking in a mirror and we're like, huh, I tend to always trigger this in people.
[0:40:55] SPEAKER_01: Right. And they get to unravel that. But I would say that like, when we start to see that people
[0:41:00] SPEAKER_01: are subjects in their own lives and not the object that I'm putting on, oh, they must
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_01: think I'm not interesting enough or whatever, we realize like, oh yeah, just like me, they have all
[0:41:14] SPEAKER_01: of these competing narratives, all these competing identifiers and histories and trajectories and
[0:41:22] SPEAKER_01: storylines basically. And so I don't know. And I think that there's something I mean, I think if
[0:41:28] SPEAKER_01: we could all just choose one mantra forever and ever, it would be, I don't know. Yeah, it's such a
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_01: powerful statement. Actually, it just it frees you from so much suffering and it frees you from
[0:41:41] SPEAKER_01: trying to manipulate your environment and other people as objects in a way that just causes more
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_01: suffering. And so just the simple like, I don't know, I don't know what's going on with them.
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_01: I don't know what's going on with me.
[0:41:54] Unknown: Yeah. Yeah. Huh. Huh. How about saying present? Just like me is also very powerful. You know,
[0:41:59] SPEAKER_00: it's like, I think it's yeah, like, yeah, as that just like me, I used to I still love doing that
[0:42:04] SPEAKER_01: when I'm in the subway or in Grand Central, because it's like such a stream of people.
[0:42:08] SPEAKER_01: Everywhere. Such diverse people. And I it's like, you know, they have pain. They want love. Just
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_01: like me. You know, it's like, and especially if I catch myself being judgy, which I almost never,
[0:42:22] Unknown: I'm just joking. I do it all the time. But it's great because it's like, because we all do it all
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_01: the time. But to catch yourself doing it, catching yourself in the act. That's a great phrase. I love
[0:42:33] SPEAKER_01: to sprinkle in that moment just like me. You know, it's like, oh, God, that person's so,
[0:42:38] SPEAKER_01: so shouty. Like, let's say I'm in my ralthing office, which is in downtown New Haven. I'll
[0:42:41] SPEAKER_01: hear someone having an argument on the street. Oh, my God. So shouty, so loud, so rude, so aggressive,
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_01: just like me. And then I can catch all the time. Well, first of all, I'm being really aggressive
[0:42:54] SPEAKER_01: in my judgments towards them right now, you know? And so not to do it in a shaming way,
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_01: but it's actually if you can get it from a place where it feels like relief, like, oh, yeah, we all
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_00: get to just exist. Like, well, we get to be human. Yeah, exactly. We all get to just be humans. We
[0:43:10] Unknown: get to all be complex. We get to all go through our stuff. Pain bodies, apparently. I think about
[0:43:18] SPEAKER_00: like this bubble of pain when we're talking about it, how it feels in my system is like,
[0:43:24] SPEAKER_00: you know, in Chogiam Trungpa Rinpoche's book, the Shambhala, The Way of the Warrior,
[0:43:29] Unknown: how he talks about like the cave. Do you ever read that one? I don't remember. It's just like
[0:43:35] SPEAKER_00: little one. I've read it. I don't remember that cave. Okay, so basically, it's really the whole
[0:43:41] Unknown: premise of it is like, we all live in these caves, and they're warm, and they're cozy.
[0:43:48] Unknown: And we see the light of day, but we're scared to go out into it. And that's really his
[0:43:55] SPEAKER_00: self-referencing bubble of pain. It's like we live with the ego and the I am Vanessa.
[0:44:02] SPEAKER_00: And I do not want to escape that on some level. You know, the unknown, the expansiveness, the
[0:44:10] Unknown: freedom of stepping out into the light of day is too threatening to me. It's too vulnerable.
[0:44:16] SPEAKER_00: And so I stay in this cave, but over time, the cave becomes dank and stanky and sweaty,
[0:44:25] SPEAKER_00: right? You can imagine it's like filth, but you know, I try to make it pretty.
[0:44:29] SPEAKER_00: I put candles and I paint it, but it's really still like this kind of dank, hot,
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_00: nasty cave after a while, right? Because you're in your own, your own stink. And yet most humans
[0:44:44] Unknown: are afraid to go out into that light of day. And I think about that with like our bubbles of pain,
[0:44:51] SPEAKER_00: which really are just our identity projects. Like all of these things, our pain buddies,
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_00: our bubbles of pain, yeah, they're programming, but that reflexive movement to make it about me
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_00: is an identity project. It's like, it's shoring up that I am separate and I am Vanessa, and Vanessa
[0:45:09] Unknown: is good or bad based on this experience. And so these identity projects are the cave
[0:45:17] Unknown: and they're the way that we perceive ourselves as safe. It's cozy. It's comfy. You know, I'm
[0:45:24] SPEAKER_00: nappy in the cave. It may smell, but I'm going to try to make it prettier. I'm going to paint a
[0:45:30] SPEAKER_00: window on it, right? I'm going to for breeze the hell out of that shit. Yeah. I'm going to like,
[0:45:35] SPEAKER_00: and we do that with our lives. Like we dress it up a little bit. We tell a little bit of a different
[0:45:41] SPEAKER_00: story, but the idea is we want to step out of these bubbles so we can have direct experience of like,
[0:45:50] SPEAKER_00: breath and expansion. But I think when I begin to understand that I have a lot of empathy for myself,
[0:45:58] SPEAKER_00: B, I start to cultivate a little more courage to like take that risk to see things as unknown.
[0:46:05] SPEAKER_00: Take that risk to say something that does feel vulnerable or do something that does feel
[0:46:10] Unknown: really vulnerable. To feel my body more, even though feelings are intense for me.
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_00: And it helps me really have a lot more compassion for people because no one wants to feel
[0:46:27] Unknown: stuck in pain. No one wants to take things personally. Like it's a very painful state.
[0:46:36] SPEAKER_00: I know many of you relate to this. I know it and I still live it sometimes, but I lived it like on a
[0:46:44] Unknown: very, every single moment basis when I was younger and it's excruciating to be stuck there. So I think,
[0:46:55] SPEAKER_00: as you've compassion for others, like, awareness is, I just posted this on social media today and
[0:47:01] SPEAKER_00: whatever our post was, but like awareness is a beautiful thing. It's the alchemical agent,
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_00: right? Like as we see, so things can unfold. But if you don't have understanding and compassion
[0:47:12] SPEAKER_00: with that awareness, like understanding of like a little bit about human nature, a little bit about
[0:47:17] SPEAKER_00: the Eagle, a little bit about what makes us move, and then the compassion that's born out of
[0:47:22] SPEAKER_00: understanding that, well then that awareness just gets co-opted again by the self-referencing ego.
[0:47:29] SPEAKER_00: And now we're judging ourselves. We're judging others, right? So Buddhism, they say,
[0:47:36] Unknown: like wisdom and compassion are like two wings of a bird. And wisdom is awareness. And you know,
[0:47:42] SPEAKER_00: if you have one without the other, there's something off.
[0:47:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I love that. I think that's a great visual to wrap it up on.
