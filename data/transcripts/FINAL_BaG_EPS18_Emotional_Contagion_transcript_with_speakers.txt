[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_00: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about being
[0:00:17] Unknown: students on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is a real
[0:00:23] SPEAKER_00: evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and crazy,
[0:00:29] SPEAKER_00: the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life? We'll be attempting
[0:00:34] SPEAKER_00: to sort that out for ourselves here on the show. We're always so glad you're listening
[0:00:38] SPEAKER_00: in. In today's episode, we're talking about the holidays and emotional contagion. As we
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_00: recorded this episode, I kept having that song, There's No Place Like Home for the Holidays,
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: stuck in my head and kind of ironically, because that's not the case for everyone. Even when
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_00: you love your family and you love your friends and you're looking forward to it, a lot can
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: arise during this time of year. So in this episode, we're talking about how can you find
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_00: sanity amidst the people who are most likely to push your buttons? What are the best ways
[0:01:14] SPEAKER_00: to navigate your friends, family and loved ones? And how can your own expectations and
[0:01:21] SPEAKER_00: belief systems be creating havoc when all you want is joy and peace? That and much more will
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_00: unfold soon. If you're enjoying the show, we'd be totally delighted if you left a review on iTunes
[0:01:34] SPEAKER_00: or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. You can also head over to blissandgrit.com and
[0:01:40] SPEAKER_00: subscribe to hear updates on any upcoming events we may be having. One last note before we head
[0:01:46] SPEAKER_00: into the conversation, Brooke and I have potty mouths, as you probably know, if you've been
[0:01:51] SPEAKER_00: listening. So if there are kids around, go ahead and pop in some headphones. Okay, here we go.
[0:01:57] Unknown: So holiday season is in full effect, I think, Brooke. And clients of mine have already begun
[0:02:10] SPEAKER_00: talking about how they're going to interact with and handle their families over the holidays. I
[0:02:17] SPEAKER_00: guess because Thanksgiving already happened and in the United States, a lot of people are with
[0:02:21] Unknown: their families during that time. And now we're moving into Christmas and Hanukkah and New Year's.
[0:02:27] SPEAKER_00: And a lot of people around the world will start to be with their families. And what's funny is we
[0:02:32] SPEAKER_00: always think in our imaginary lands, holidays seem like such a dear time, right? So precious,
[0:02:39] Unknown: and we're going to be around our loved ones and decorate. And yet for so many people,
[0:02:45] Unknown: being around their family is a really huge source of stress. And they'll start to predict it like
[0:02:55] SPEAKER_00: three weeks before and they'll need like a detox three weeks after. So it got me thinking about,
[0:03:01] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if you ever heard that Ram Dass quote, but Ram Dass said so beautifully,
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_00: if you think you're enlightened, go spend a week with your family.
[0:03:10] SPEAKER_01: I love that one.
[0:03:14] Unknown: It's just so fucking genius. I mean, nobody knows. I guess I was going to say nobody knows
[0:03:23] Unknown: how to push your buttons like your family. But then again, it's really probably more like
[0:03:29] SPEAKER_00: nobody else is able to allow you to want to push your own buttons.
[0:03:36] SPEAKER_01: Right. We were all crafting in the button factory together.
[0:03:41] SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So I thought we could talk a little bit about family dynamics, holidays,
[0:03:48] SPEAKER_00: and emotional contagion from all those psychological and spiritual angles we just love so much.
[0:03:55] Unknown: Yeah, I love it. Yeah, we have certain layers of intimacy and these are the inner inner circle
[0:04:07] SPEAKER_01: people who we were born to and are related to like siblings, also born to your parents
[0:04:14] Unknown: and everything. And so there's just this way where you share a more close to the bone kind of
[0:04:23] SPEAKER_01: intricate psychological weaving that you've all gone through together and you identify with them
[0:04:30] SPEAKER_01: differently than you would friends, even your closest friends, or then you would,
[0:04:35] SPEAKER_01: you know, this comes up in marriages and partnerships a lot too.
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_01: But that's still a person you chose at some point in your adult life.
[0:04:44] SPEAKER_01: And you're navigating that by choice, you know, as adults. So yeah, our families have this
[0:04:51] Unknown: special way of not just getting us worked up, bringing out those parts of ourselves that we
[0:05:00] SPEAKER_01: might like to pretend we don't have anymore, but also really getting us to notice just how much
[0:05:07] SPEAKER_01: we want to steer their ship, you know, and that we believe we're the ones who maybe are more
[0:05:13] SPEAKER_01: enlightened and we've got it figured out and if only they could be more like blah, or if only they
[0:05:18] Unknown: could understand more deeply whatever the thing that I understand. So really so much of the pain
[0:05:26] SPEAKER_01: comes from trying to hold on to the reins when really the reins aren't ours.
[0:05:33] SPEAKER_00: All right. Well, that is the much broader overarching issue, I think probably in life,
[0:05:40] Unknown: right? Like trying to control things and manage them seems to be a huge part of our dilemma.
[0:05:48] SPEAKER_00: We don't have a problem, we just think we have a problem and our management of it seems to be
[0:05:53] Unknown: the most problematic element. But I'm thinking as you were talking about,
[0:05:57] Unknown: I was talking to a client the other day and we were talking about how she gets
[0:06:03] SPEAKER_00: tired around people, like she didn't want to be around people and, you know, that kind of
[0:06:07] SPEAKER_00: HSP conundrum we talked about in the spiritually sensitive episode. And I don't know if I shared
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_00: this at the time, but I'm finally starting to kind of put the pieces together on this in a more
[0:06:19] SPEAKER_00: clear way. I realized that in psychology, the way that we get wounded is in relationship to people,
[0:06:29] SPEAKER_00: period, right? Like we're born kind of pure, we have these wonderful potentialities, perhaps we
[0:06:36] SPEAKER_00: have some karma, that's a whole other discussion, but we're born with potentiality, kind of happy
[0:06:41] Unknown: beings wired for joy. And then life comes along, most often in the form of people, we could have
[0:06:49] SPEAKER_00: traumatic accidents as well. But most of our wounding and our pain bodies are created
[0:06:54] Unknown: in relationship to others. So now, I started to realize for myself that I think in my mind,
[0:07:02] SPEAKER_00: I often thought of myself as an introvert, because I don't always like to be around people.
[0:07:08] SPEAKER_00: Very few people do I like to be around, I will often complain about people and like having to be
[0:07:13] Unknown: around them. And I want a lot of time alone. And then I came to realize, actually, I don't
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_00: think I'm an introvert, because I do best when I travel in like, big fun groups with common
[0:07:24] SPEAKER_00: purposes, like retreats or like, I went to China to study Chinese medicine, it was the best,
[0:07:30] SPEAKER_00: the best time of my life, being with like a committed group of people in a similar,
[0:07:35] Unknown: you know, path on a similar path. What I am is someone who has relationship issues.
[0:07:42] Unknown: And when I'm around people, my landmines start getting triggered as they, you know, just walk
[0:07:50] Unknown: through the fields and unwittingly set them off. Then things like the fact that I may not have great
[0:07:57] SPEAKER_00: boundaries, you know, I don't know how to stop talking about something I may not want to talk
[0:08:01] Unknown: about anymore. Things like the energetics, like I'm quite quick to think I want you to feel better
[0:08:08] SPEAKER_00: and absorb as much of your suffering as I can into my system so that I'll deal with it. You know,
[0:08:15] Unknown: all of these different intimacy issues and relational issues that I developed, make it hard
[0:08:22] SPEAKER_00: to be around people. So I'd rather just be alone. It's not because that's what I want.
[0:08:26] Unknown: Not a hermit. Some people are, it's not me. So I think like when we start to think about the
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_00: holidays, we can think about that first very basic level. It's a time when you're supposed
[0:08:38] Unknown: to be around people. You may want to be around people or you may not, but you may recognize
[0:08:45] SPEAKER_00: that whenever you are, it takes something from you. It's draining. It's too much. You get triggered,
[0:08:52] Unknown: you get depressed, you get anxious, but you think you're supposed to want it and you kind of do
[0:08:58] SPEAKER_00: want it, but you shouldn't. And so I think just starting there is where we can start to
[0:09:04] SPEAKER_00: pre-anticipate the holidays or need three weeks post-holiday just to recover.
[0:09:09] Unknown: Right, totally. Yeah. So for me, well, first of all, that great quote, I think it's Jean-Paul
[0:09:16] Unknown: Sartre, but I'm not sure. Hell is other people. So great. And I was thinking too about when we
[0:09:24] SPEAKER_01: were with Judith Blackstone, training in the realization process, and we were talking about
[0:09:32] Unknown: being able to feel, I don't know that she would use the term energetic systems, but essentially
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_01: that was what we were talking about. And you said that it's much easier for you to feel
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_01: trees. Like, is it easier with trees? And Judith said, no, actually, people are much denser,
[0:09:49] SPEAKER_01: like human beings have much denser energy bodies than trees. It's just that, you know,
[0:09:53] SPEAKER_01: they're people in like her perfect kind of Brooklyn affect way. So great. So funny.
[0:10:00] SPEAKER_01: Stupid people. Trees are so nice. Trees are just trees. Like they're not going to trigger you.
[0:10:05] Unknown: They're not going to bother you. They're so much better than pets even. They don't need anything.
[0:10:11] SPEAKER_01: They have great boundaries. They're on it. So you and the trees, I totally get it. Yeah. So I,
[0:10:20] SPEAKER_01: you know, I guess the first line of defense is the wrong word, but the first line of awareness
[0:10:26] SPEAKER_01: is awareness. Like, are there certain people who you know are going to be, or who have historically
[0:10:32] SPEAKER_01: been challenging? Because we don't want to set this up in a way where we're pre-creating
[0:10:37] SPEAKER_01: problematic engagements. You know, like my mother always makes me crazy over the holidays. Like,
[0:10:43] SPEAKER_01: let's say you have a parent or a family member, a sibling. I hear this a lot from my clients too,
[0:10:47] SPEAKER_01: particularly like the sibling they see once every two years on purpose and it's only for some
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_01: holiday gathering. And it's just like, they know it's going to be fireworks. So even in the lead
[0:10:59] Unknown: up, it's not that we want to silver lining it or decide, no, it's going to be great. Like,
[0:11:08] SPEAKER_01: I'm just going to go in there because it's all about what's really happening for you. So if you
[0:11:13] SPEAKER_01: go in there with a big smile and you're really, I'm really going to ask them about that new job.
[0:11:17] SPEAKER_01: This year, I'm really going to be understanding. This year, I'm really going to be engaged.
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_01: They'll feel if underneath it all, you're like, oh my God, I know this is going to be a fucking
[0:11:24] Unknown: shit show at some point. So awareness helps a lot as a precursor, awareness without jumping to
[0:11:34] Unknown: an unfortunate conclusion already. And then it comes down to slowing down time, you know? So none
[0:11:42] Unknown: of these things are happening yet. And then when you get there, you have to kind of take things in
[0:11:48] Unknown: a moment by moment way. And so what that feels like for me, it feels a lot the way that I feel
[0:11:57] Unknown: when I meditate, which is I'm in my body. I'm feeling more spacious, which is one of those
[0:12:07] SPEAKER_01: words that we want to do a whole episode on. So for anyone who's listening, who's like blah,
[0:12:12] SPEAKER_01: blah, what does that mean? Like, if it doesn't make sense, chuck it. But it basically has that
[0:12:17] SPEAKER_01: feeling that it's not so compressed right up against what assumptions you've made in advance
[0:12:23] SPEAKER_01: about this person. And you can almost regard them with a little bit of a distance. So I'm not trying
[0:12:29] SPEAKER_01: to advocate like taking on a creepy serial killer vibe with your family and watching them like
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_01: their characters on TV. But I'm also not advocating that. Like chuck the creepy part of it. And like,
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_01: if you need a little time out, just see, can I really see them? Like I do this with my mother,
[0:12:47] SPEAKER_01: because she and I have like, we see each other a lot. And in many ways, we have a very close
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_01: relationship. We also have a complicated relationship, like many mothers and daughters.
[0:12:55] SPEAKER_01: And if I'm having one of those moments where I'm telling myself all kinds of stories about
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_01: what I wish she believed, or what I wish she could say or do, or why can't she just, you know,
[0:13:05] SPEAKER_01: chill out? Or why can't she just see the other side of the story or blah, blah, blah. If I just
[0:13:09] SPEAKER_01: take this moment and like, I'll even just use the cue, like just look at her, you know, just look at
[0:13:15] SPEAKER_01: her. And I don't mean look in that kind of hard look into her eyes, zone in, focus in. It's more
[0:13:21] SPEAKER_01: like I try and see her and I see all the space around her. And I also feel myself in my own body.
[0:13:25] SPEAKER_01: So this comes from Judith too, Judith Blackstone, the realization process. Can you regard that
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_01: person from within your own body? And suddenly, just, I don't know, it has this magic quality for
[0:13:36] SPEAKER_01: me. If I'm starting to race towards getting agitated with her, where it's like, I just,
[0:13:42] SPEAKER_01: I see her as the human being in that particular moment, and not the whole ball of twine that
[0:13:51] SPEAKER_01: our relationship has been, or, you know, or that I anticipate it will be. And it's just my mom
[0:13:56] SPEAKER_01: talking. And I don't know, it just brings this whole softness into the interaction. Does that
[0:14:02] SPEAKER_00: make sense of you? Yeah, yeah. For those of you who are somatically inclined, what was really
[0:14:09] Unknown: interesting about watching Judith work was she would talk about how your past can get stored in
[0:14:16] Unknown: your eyes, like literally in the tissue of your eyes, that it can become like a filter. And you
[0:14:23] SPEAKER_00: could see it like clear as day when people were fogged by their past. And then she would have them
[0:14:28] SPEAKER_00: do an exercise where they kind of released the past from their eyes. And I mean, right, Brooke?
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_00: Totally mind blowing. Like, whoa. And then all of a sudden, you can see not through the eyes of the
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_00: seven-year-old who was really hurt by this person, but through the eyes of a 43-year-old woman who's,
[0:14:50] Unknown: you know, lived, loved, lost, and has a much richer relationship to life. So it almost sounds like,
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_00: in a way, you are clearing the past from your eyes as you soften your gaze and you become present.
[0:15:04] SPEAKER_00: Right? I mean, ultimately, what you're describing is becoming very present in the way that you see
[0:15:09] Unknown: her. Kieran also recommends something that I have not tried. I haven't needed it yet, and I haven't
[0:15:16] SPEAKER_00: been able to quite get there. But she said specifically, look at the person's ears while
[0:15:21] Unknown: they're talking. Ears. She said, look at their ear. Don't look in their eyes. She said she's tried
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_00: everywhere on a person's face and only the ear works to not absorb them while you're still in
[0:15:33] SPEAKER_00: a codependent phase. And we should talk about that. But so while you're still kind of corded
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_00: with this person in this codependent way, look at their ears, sit and hold space, but actually don't
[0:15:45] SPEAKER_00: listen to their words. She said they will feel very heard and you will not have to be triggered.
[0:15:52] SPEAKER_00: So there's a couple of tools you all can put in your pocket. We can maybe bookmark those again at
[0:15:57] Unknown: the end. But you said a couple of things I wanted to kind of flesh out a little bit to go a little
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_00: deeper into the conversation. So a few years back, I wrote an article on emotional contagion.
[0:16:10] SPEAKER_00: And we might have mentioned it in the spiritually sensitive episode. I'm not sure, but
[0:16:15] SPEAKER_00: we can talk a lot about energy and all of us can imagine that we feel vibes. I mean,
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: I've never asked a person who didn't feel vibes. So I think we can all say we feel vibes. And in
[0:16:26] SPEAKER_00: a way that's picking up on energy, a lot of people will acknowledge that maybe they came somewhere in
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_00: a good mood and they met a friend or a family member who was super anxious or super angry and
[0:16:37] SPEAKER_00: they left in a disturbed mood. Or you went and spent time with someone and you ended up
[0:16:45] SPEAKER_00: exhausted after. Well, we can look at that from the energetic level, but in the world of psychology,
[0:16:52] Unknown: they just call it emotional contagion. In other words, emotions are contagious, right?
[0:16:58] Unknown: Doesn't take a lot. In fact, they have found smoking is contagious. Eating habits are contagious.
[0:17:06] SPEAKER_00: Thinking is contagious. I mean, duh, we're wired together, right? We're interconnected. So,
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_00: all right. So emotions are contagious. Now with your family, it goes up, turn that dial up by
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_00: probably a hundred. So they did this other research study where they were in Spain.
[0:17:27] SPEAKER_00: And there's a special event in Spain where people walk across hot coals. So there were people
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_00: walking across hot coals and then they had family members watching and cheering them on. And they
[0:17:38] Unknown: hooked people up to EKGs. And so they hooked the people watching up and they hooked the people
[0:17:42] Unknown: doing it up. And what they noticed was the people watching when their family member was crossing the
[0:17:48] Unknown: hot coals, their EKGs synced. Their heart rates sync. That's how wired we are with our family.
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_00: There's another little bit of data. I don't know if you know this one, Brooke, but
[0:18:03] SPEAKER_00: they did some experiments with cortisol. So cortisol is a stress hormone that we have in our
[0:18:08] Unknown: blood where they measured a child's cortisol levels separate. They measured an adult's cortisol
[0:18:15] Unknown: levels separate. They put them into the same room. They measured their blood cortisol levels again.
[0:18:23] Unknown: And what happened was the parents went down and the child's went up. We are a homeostatic
[0:18:33] Unknown: system. And we're designed like that. So there was this psychological research on emotional
[0:18:40] SPEAKER_00: contagion. I don't know if this is true. And I wish I could remember where I get my research from. This
[0:18:45] SPEAKER_00: I may have cited somewhere, but they said you have about two hours with your family. If you're really
[0:18:52] SPEAKER_00: well practiced, you have about two hours where you're clear thinking and you're Brooke Thomas
[0:18:58] SPEAKER_00: and you're BinociScotto and at 43 and I love meditation. And then all of a sudden after two
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_00: hours you start to get nappy. And then your belief systems, your old thoughts and thinking patterns
[0:19:11] SPEAKER_00: that would show up in your family start to get stirred. And it's only a matter of time before you
[0:19:17] Unknown: can feel the pull to go back to these old patterns. So I mean, that's kind of crazy.
[0:19:24] SPEAKER_01: It is crazy, but I think we've also all lived it. Like listening to you, I'm like,
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_01: mm-hmm, yep, two hours, yep, nappy, yep. Then I start going down.
[0:19:35] SPEAKER_00: There are people, like there is a defense mechanism in psychology. We often talk about
[0:19:40] SPEAKER_00: repression or all of these things, sublimation. Well, there is a defense mechanism that is
[0:19:47] SPEAKER_00: sleeping. My sister's classic for that one. That's not my defense.
[0:19:51] Unknown: It's one of my favorites. I'm super into that. Oh, yeah.
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_00: Oh, every holiday my sister takes a nap. Full fledged in front of everybody falls asleep,
[0:20:00] SPEAKER_01: like on the couch. Yeah, I nap the hell out of napping through the holidays. It's good stuff.
[0:20:07] SPEAKER_00: So the first thing is obviously compassion, compassion, compassion. We all go there and
[0:20:12] Unknown: we're wired to go there. So that's part of it. But I was thinking about, I used the analogy of
[0:20:19] SPEAKER_00: landmines before, and I don't know, this is how it works in my mind. Pain body is probably our more
[0:20:27] Unknown: psychospiritual way of saying it. But these people planted the landmines in us, many of them,
[0:20:37] SPEAKER_00: I mean, through their behaviors, through their belief systems, and then also through our
[0:20:42] SPEAKER_00: intergenerational trauma and our DNA and our neurobiological wiring. So these people planted
[0:20:48] SPEAKER_00: the landmines, but like 20 years later, they don't remember where they planted them. They don't know
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_00: they're there. Right? You know, they're not trying to always set them off. Some assholes are.
[0:20:58] SPEAKER_01: I was going to say, are you sure? No, but only the assholes. Only the assholes.
[0:21:02] Unknown: The assholes are a smaller percentage. Yes. They are. And we should talk about them before
[0:21:07] SPEAKER_00: we hang up. But most people, most of your lovers, your friends, your family members,
[0:21:13] SPEAKER_00: they are not trying to set off your pain body landmine. They don't know where it is. They're
[0:21:19] SPEAKER_00: strolling through the woods of relationship with you. And then they set it off. And as you and I
[0:21:27] SPEAKER_00: know full well, that what happens with the pain body is it has a life of its own. So once exploded,
[0:21:35] SPEAKER_00: remember, I think we've said it before, but the pain body stores neurobiologically with a thought
[0:21:42] Unknown: or many thoughts, like a thought stream with feelings and emotions and with sensations and
[0:21:48] Unknown: behaviors. Right? So it has its own thoughts, its own emotions and its own embodied physical reality,
[0:21:57] Unknown: behaviors and sensations. So once that pain body is tripped, you're living from the pain body,
[0:22:07] SPEAKER_00: unless you're very practiced, which is obviously what we're all hoping for ourselves.
[0:22:11] Unknown: And so until you get that traction with yourself, the pain body is blown up. You're in those thoughts,
[0:22:18] SPEAKER_00: you're in those feelings. And now all of a sudden you're not the person you recognized
[0:22:22] Unknown: or liked so much. Yeah. Just like two weeks ago. And you can even be inside yourself while it's
[0:22:28] SPEAKER_01: happening, while the pain body has taken over going, why am I doing this? Why am I this person?
[0:22:34] SPEAKER_01: I promised myself I wasn't going to be this person this year. And, you know, pain body,
[0:22:39] SPEAKER_01: just for point of reference, this is Eckhart Tolle's term. And he does an exquisite job of
[0:22:45] SPEAKER_01: describing it in both of his books, The Power of Now and A New Earth. I've been listening to A New
[0:22:50] Unknown: Earth lately, the audio, so it's fresh in my mind. And he really talks about it very directly as
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_01: like this energetic parasite that lives in you and like feeds on the host body. It's really
[0:23:05] SPEAKER_01: interesting the way he describes it. I know it's so gross. Vanessa's making an oogie face at me on
[0:23:11] SPEAKER_01: Skype. Because it is. But it does. It feels like that. It does take over you. And I think we've all
[0:23:17] SPEAKER_01: had that, like, all you have to do is watch the news or think about the fact that road rage is
[0:23:22] SPEAKER_01: something that exists in our society to know that people get overtaken by their pain bodies and do
[0:23:28] SPEAKER_01: crazy shit that they wouldn't have done like maybe three hours earlier when they were at the
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_01: office, like eating birthday cake with their friend before they went home for the day to
[0:23:37] SPEAKER_01: celebrate their birthday. Like we all have these funny little energetic parasites that live in us
[0:23:43] Unknown: and you just like hook that tripwire and suddenly it's alive in you. So knowing that that's a thing
[0:23:52] SPEAKER_01: and that it's going to become active because that's just a part of the human journey.
[0:23:58] SPEAKER_01: Unless it's healed and released.
[0:23:59] SPEAKER_01: Unless it's healed and released. But we have a bunch of them and yeah, it's a process of
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_01: elimination. It's a process of not giving the parasite food. So I guess that's what I would
[0:24:10] Unknown: like to talk about is like how do you not, how do you recognize when you a pain body has taken over
[0:24:15] SPEAKER_01: you and how do you stop feeding it? Because when you stop feeding it, it does die eventually but
[0:24:22] SPEAKER_01: at least it goes away when you don't give it the food source. And it's honestly like, especially
[0:24:28] SPEAKER_01: in the beginning stages of starting to work with this, it gets easier but in the beginning, it's
[0:24:32] SPEAKER_01: very hard. Because it's telling you all of this stuff like of how important it is and how right
[0:24:39] SPEAKER_01: it is and how it's the thing to pay attention to and it feels like your life depends on feeding it.
[0:24:48] SPEAKER_00: Oh gosh, I think my mind is actually being blown as we're talking. So if I get a little loopy,
[0:24:53] Unknown: forgive me. It's like, what's happening? So these combos are four, it's all good.
[0:24:59] SPEAKER_00: Okay. I think how do you stop feeding it is a good question. I was listening to, I think it was,
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: I think his name is Jim Tolles. It was a Buddha at the gas pump conversation. But he was basically
[0:25:12] SPEAKER_00: saying that he was talking about sensitive people and absorbing energy. And I mean, he thinks most
[0:25:17] SPEAKER_00: of us are sensitive, but you just become aware that you're doing that you're absorbing energy.
[0:25:23] SPEAKER_00: And his experience was that you reach a point where you're clear enough. You don't have these
[0:25:29] SPEAKER_00: pain bodies that you really don't do that anymore. That, I mean, it's all energy and energy just moves.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_00: This is what one of my energy workers used to say to me back in the day, you know, energy just moves.
[0:25:41] SPEAKER_00: It can't stick in you unless there's something for it to stick to. Right. But we've all got a
[0:25:46] SPEAKER_00: lot of Velcro in there. So, right. So in other words, it's good to have this larger vision of,
[0:25:52] SPEAKER_00: it doesn't have to be like that. Like energy just moves. Because I think sometimes when people are
[0:25:56] SPEAKER_00: sensitive, we're like, well, you know, it's there. I was just around this crappy person. And then I
[0:26:00] SPEAKER_00: got in a crappy mood. And you don't realize like, no, this is information for you about where you're
[0:26:06] SPEAKER_00: stuck, where there's Velcro. It's all like food for evolution for you. So Judith would say the
[0:26:16] SPEAKER_00: same thing, you know, like you're spiritually sensitive. Yes. But once you're embodied, no,
[0:26:21] Unknown: like you don't absorb people's energy. Right. Right. And that's probably when you're more free
[0:26:27] Unknown: around family members. And so the first thing is it is possible. It is utterly possible that if you
[0:26:35] SPEAKER_00: have difficult relationships right now with friends, family members, loved ones, you know,
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_00: partners, that you can dissolve that, that you can be non-reactive around them. So let's lay out
[0:26:47] Unknown: possibility. And then maybe we could talk about how we can start to work with that. Because I think
[0:26:52] Unknown: you and I have, and we have some stuff to share. I thought maybe then we can talk about what are some
[0:26:58] Unknown: of the common Velcros? Yeah. What are some of the common sticky places? So I mentioned the word
[0:27:05] SPEAKER_00: codependency before, which is actually not my favorite word. I hate that word. I know you do.
[0:27:11] Unknown: And it is not a good word because it implies that, you know, being interdependent is a good thing.
[0:27:17] SPEAKER_01: And it's also inevitable. Yeah. But codependent, if it had a different name, what it describes
[0:27:25] Unknown: is I think critically important. I know. Maybe I hate it because I have it. I can't really say
[0:27:32] SPEAKER_00: for sure. I just don't like the word. I think, you know, going to school for psychology, they may
[0:27:36] Unknown: have overused it. But it's a good word to use because we all are aware of it. So if you were
[0:27:44] SPEAKER_00: talking to an energy worker or a shaman, they may say that you are corded very strongly with this
[0:27:51] SPEAKER_00: person. If you were talking to a psychologist, they would say you are codependent with this person.
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_00: I like corded in a way. I think better because I think it describes my experience more.
[0:28:05] Unknown: Codependence in my mind brings up like actions and choices. And there is that, yes. But it's not just
[0:28:14] SPEAKER_00: that I can be free to choose how to act with my family members. When you are corded to someone,
[0:28:21] SPEAKER_00: someone, when you are energetically entangled with them on a fundamental level,
[0:28:29] Unknown: there is a lot less experience of choice. That's why I like corded. Does that make sense?
[0:28:36] Unknown: Yes, I completely agree. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I've done energy work where I can see
[0:28:43] SPEAKER_00: big, thick cords, like going to my parents. I mean, I'm quite enmeshed with my parents
[0:28:50] Unknown: in that way, less and less and less and less. But, Lord, this has been 43 years of trying to
[0:28:58] Unknown: chip away at it. So a couple of things about that. When we have these cords, when we are in a
[0:29:06] SPEAKER_00: codependent relationship, maybe one part that it means is we think that their happiness depends on
[0:29:13] Unknown: us and our happiness depends on them. That statement alone is huge because it means we
[0:29:20] SPEAKER_00: feel responsible for their well-being, which means when they are not well or happy or calm or healthy,
[0:29:29] Unknown: we start to feel guilty or panicked or like a heavy burden on our shoulders.
[0:29:36] Unknown: We feel obligated to do something about it. And since in reality, we actually have nothing to do
[0:29:46] Unknown: with their state of mind, it's like a no win battle. And that is exhausting. So that's one
[0:29:52] Unknown: half of that coin. The other side is feeling like they are responsible for making us happy
[0:30:00] SPEAKER_00: and that unless they are happy and doing the right things, we cannot be.
[0:30:04] SPEAKER_00: And I see that also. It's like if they don't validate me, I can't feel validated. If they
[0:30:10] SPEAKER_00: don't change the way that they act, I can never feel good because I don't have the family member
[0:30:16] SPEAKER_00: I want or the love I want or the mirroring I needed. So in this way, our very happiness
[0:30:22] SPEAKER_00: and well-being can feel wired to their behaviors and their choices, which is terrible because if
[0:30:30] SPEAKER_00: you're not happy about your family, it means they were unskillful in their choices and in their
[0:30:34] SPEAKER_00: thoughts and in their feelings. So I think at that very basic part of co-dependence, it's part of why
[0:30:42] SPEAKER_00: we get triggered so much because you go in there, you want them to say a certain thing they're not
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_00: saying or to be in a certain mood they're not or to not say what they would say or choose what they
[0:30:53] SPEAKER_00: would choose because it all feels like either I can't be happy or I have to somehow fix something.
[0:31:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And when you're in that trap, when you're believing that that's true,
[0:31:05] SPEAKER_01: there's no room for you to make a choice that would actually be good for you because if I'm
[0:31:12] SPEAKER_01: believing that I need my mother to be in a good mood in order for me to enjoy Christmas dinner,
[0:31:18] SPEAKER_01: it just is like the no-win situation, right? Like I'm tugging on her to be something she's not.
[0:31:25] Unknown: And so if she's feeling that I need her to be something she's not, which feels unloving and
[0:31:30] SPEAKER_01: shamy and judgy and aggressive and pushy, and then I'm also deciding that I have no agency.
[0:31:37] SPEAKER_01: It all relies on her. She has to get it together or my dad has to get together or my brother and
[0:31:42] SPEAKER_01: my mom need to get along or whatever in order for me to feel okay. So it completely removes any of
[0:31:48] SPEAKER_01: my own agency from the situation. And once you've done that, in many ways, it's actually this kind
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: of convenient trick that the ego does to convince you that you don't have agency so that you just
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_01: get stuck in the straight jacket and you're like, womp, womp. Like that's like-
[0:32:02] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. You get to be helpless, which has a weird good feeling associated with it's not your fault.
[0:32:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. You're the good one.
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_00: Because you're not to blame, you can't help it. But it feels actually super shitty and we don't
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_00: actually like it, but we kind of- Yeah, we kind of crave it.
[0:32:19] SPEAKER_01: ... keep those aloes. Yes. We talked about it in Selfless Love a little bit. So it's on the radar
[0:32:25] SPEAKER_01: a little bit. And when we can unhook from that the idea that I need everything out there to look
[0:32:32] SPEAKER_01: a certain way in order for me to have the feeling I want to have, then you can start making different
[0:32:37] SPEAKER_01: kinds of decisions. Let's say that it's the first one I started with. Christmas dinner,
[0:32:42] SPEAKER_01: your mother's in a terrible mood and the thought comes, I need her to be in a happy mood too.
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_01: And we wouldn't even be aware of this thought, right? We just go straight into action mode,
[0:32:50] SPEAKER_01: but I need her to be happy in order for me to enjoy Christmas dinner. And there's a million
[0:32:55] SPEAKER_01: tiny stories that come hooked into that. Christmas is supposed to look a certain way. People are
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_01: supposed to behave a certain way. This time of year is a certain kind of import. If that doesn't
[0:33:04] SPEAKER_01: happen, it means that I am going to... But when you can start just pulling away some of those veils
[0:33:11] Unknown: and seeing that those stories are not true, then what you're left with is your agency. It is your
[0:33:20] SPEAKER_01: opportunity. And it's like, gosh, well... And this is where I feel like people start to sometimes
[0:33:25] SPEAKER_01: feel like it's taboo. You're allowed to decide that you don't want to sit at a dinner table
[0:33:31] SPEAKER_01: with someone who in this example is miserable. You're allowed to make that choice loving in a
[0:33:36] SPEAKER_01: loving way. Let's say it's truly miserable, right? And you're like, I love you so much and gee,
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_01: I'll help you put the dishes in the dishwasher and then I'm heading right home. Or whatever
[0:33:49] SPEAKER_01: you need to do to give yourself more space. Or maybe it means that suddenly you discover
[0:33:54] SPEAKER_01: this whole wellspring of ability to enjoy the dinner because you're just enjoying the dinner
[0:34:00] SPEAKER_01: and you're not worried about what's up with everyone else. And I swear to you, once you
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_01: get to that place where you're just in yourself and you're letting other people's business be
[0:34:09] Unknown: their business, the energy changes. So, this is the thing about it. When you stop trying
[0:34:15] Unknown: to fix or manipulate out there, the funny thing about it is that ironically, it actually changes.
[0:34:24] SPEAKER_01: Not in this perfect snow white birds alighting on your arms kind of way,
[0:34:28] SPEAKER_01: but suddenly there's a movement that's different. And when I do this thing like I was saying with
[0:34:35] SPEAKER_01: my mother where I can just suddenly regard her in the present moment in a more spacious way,
[0:34:42] SPEAKER_01: where I'm not telling myself all the stories about who she is or what she should be or what she should
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_01: be saying or thinking or feeling. And I'm literally just see her, it's like I zoom out kind of. And
[0:34:52] SPEAKER_01: I zoom out and also ground down into myself and regard her. It's the funniest thing. Suddenly,
[0:34:59] SPEAKER_01: our conversation becomes something it never could have been before. Suddenly, she's not just playing
[0:35:04] Unknown: her tape and I'm not just playing my tape. And we actually get this moment of like, I mean,
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_01: it's almost uncanny. Sometimes I'll do it, let's say she's talking about politics,
[0:35:15] SPEAKER_01: which is a subject we avoid the most. It's also the subject she wants to talk about the most.
[0:35:21] SPEAKER_01: And I'll just do this thing where I kind of get present and really, really lovingly regard her
[0:35:26] SPEAKER_01: without pushing at her. I'm in myself. And suddenly she'll start telling me about
[0:35:30] Unknown: what painting she's most excited about that she's making or this great book she just read.
[0:35:36] SPEAKER_01: And then we get this chance to connect in this new way. So it's uncanny. I'm sure you've,
[0:35:40] SPEAKER_00: I know you've found that too. Yeah, in a way it's like we have to let things be unpredictable.
[0:35:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. If we expect things to be a certain way, which we do when it comes to family,
[0:35:50] Unknown: because it's like 40 years tells me it will be like this. And then we prepare for that.
[0:35:57] Unknown: And that means a certain thing. And when I was in counseling, when I was in psychotherapy,
[0:36:03] Unknown: when I was living in San Francisco, and I think I told the story, but I was in school and I'm
[0:36:08] Unknown: working on some of the issues I had up with my mother. And it was things like she guilt me and
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_00: she needs too much and all of these different things, which like, it does not matter at all
[0:36:20] SPEAKER_00: that my mom has very human needs to be close with her daughter. What mattered is that I was
[0:36:25] SPEAKER_00: codependently wired. So her very human need brought out a guilt response in me that I was
[0:36:31] Unknown: then blaming her for, right? Even though it's my baggage. So once I realized that she's entitled
[0:36:38] SPEAKER_00: to be human and to have wants and to have needs, and I am entitled not to meet them, which I had
[0:36:43] SPEAKER_00: not realized earlier, things softened. And when things softened towards her, like you're describing
[0:36:49] SPEAKER_00: with your mother, I didn't expect her to change. It wasn't for her. That's always the caveat.
[0:36:55] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, very important. We're not trying to expect people to change. That's the part we have to
[0:36:59] SPEAKER_00: sacrifice. Yeah. Always checking in with our motivation and inspiration. But the motivation
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_00: was for me to be free of the response and the reaction, right? And then lo and behold, they did.
[0:37:11] Unknown: And because we're all connected, what I realized was I was walking up to her defended bristly,
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_00: like expecting her to annoy me, expecting her to ask for something I didn't want to give,
[0:37:25] SPEAKER_00: expecting her to guilt me. I was really seeing her through the eyes of my past and the ways that I
[0:37:32] SPEAKER_00: wasn't getting met. And it's interesting how narcissistic we can be like that, right? It's
[0:37:38] SPEAKER_00: like, it's not that we're arrogant. It's not that we don't give a shit about humans. It's that
[0:37:44] SPEAKER_00: kind of chuggy and trunked parampashe version of just so self-referencing that everything's like
[0:37:50] SPEAKER_00: me, me, me, and what she's doing to me and what she wasn't giving. And then as soon as I released
[0:37:56] SPEAKER_00: and I can soften and realize I can't save them, in fact, I don't have to save them. In fact,
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_00: it's a lot of fucking hubris to think it's my job as someone 30 years her junior to save her.
[0:38:13] SPEAKER_00: She's done her life. And also, by the way, she's God. So, I mean, what kind of shit is this?
[0:38:21] SPEAKER_00: Because we all are.
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_00: Because we all are. I wasn't mad at myself for it. It was just this opening of my mind that was
[0:38:29] Unknown: laughing. You're holding all this responsibility and A, it's ruining your relationship with your
[0:38:35] SPEAKER_00: mother. You're finding her very annoying because of the responsibility you decided to hold. And B,
[0:38:42] Unknown: you're completely missing the truth, which is this is her ride and she's God and she gets choice.
[0:38:49] SPEAKER_00: And that's what we get in this world and let her have it. Right?
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:38:53] SPEAKER_00: And she shifted. And over the years that's evolved more and more and more and more. I mean,
[0:38:59] SPEAKER_00: with this mold illness, my mom's been like remarkable, like whatever you need to get
[0:39:04] Unknown: better. I mean, my parents last time when I was moving from New York to San Francisco and they
[0:39:09] SPEAKER_00: didn't want me to, my mom was like, what could I bribe you with? Like, what could I do to make you
[0:39:14] Unknown: stay? You know, it was crazy, very Italian. This time I'm moving from Miami to Austin, I think.
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_00: And my mom's like, as long as you're getting better. And I'm like, who the fuck
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_00: is this person on the phone with me? But I was prepared to be surprised by her. I am always now
[0:39:38] Unknown: way more prepared to be surprised by people. And I think that's hard with our family members. You
[0:39:43] Unknown: know, there's so many pain bodies and so many unmet needs that we just imagine that if only
[0:39:51] Unknown: they got met, that would be the answer. We don't realize that that's not at all relevant.
[0:40:00] Unknown: So yes, like you were saying, Brooke, like when you can shift, if you can, if you can.
[0:40:08] SPEAKER_01: This is a tiny baby steps thing. Like it's just two seconds notice that you're running a story
[0:40:14] SPEAKER_01: about how it's going to go. Boom. Big deal. That's a big deal. Right. Maybe you got an hour out of it
[0:40:21] Unknown: where you enjoyed the person or maybe you got two minutes or maybe you got a whole holiday and then
[0:40:27] SPEAKER_00: you didn't get the next one or you didn't get the next phone call, you know, but this is kind of
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_00: just the process. And how can you bring a lot of compassion to this human journey? Because
[0:40:38] Unknown: we've all been exposed to intergenerational trauma. Most people in this world are unskillful,
[0:40:46] Unknown: not kind, not mirroring, hurt, afraid, and that gets passed down, right? And our genetics and our
[0:40:54] Unknown: and our neurobiological wiring. So we can have compassion for the whole human equation,
[0:41:03] SPEAKER_00: us, them, everybody without having to forego our needs. So I think let's talk about that. Like you
[0:41:10] SPEAKER_00: mentioned moving away, you can do that. Let's talk about choice, but we don't have to forego our needs.
[0:41:17] Unknown: You know, like Maharaj said, you know, you can keep them in your heart, but you don't have to
[0:41:22] Unknown: keep them in your life. Yeah, we do have choice. But we can bring a lot of compassion to ourselves
[0:41:29] SPEAKER_00: and to them as we, you know, recognize our own humanity and these pain bodies that are just a
[0:41:35] SPEAKER_01: part of the equation. Yeah, I was talking with this is just making me think like as an example
[0:41:40] SPEAKER_01: of how often we tell ourselves that we don't get to do what's okay for us and what's a yes for us.
[0:41:47] SPEAKER_01: I was talking with a woman about her Thanksgiving, you know, it is that time, you're right, we're all
[0:41:51] SPEAKER_01: talking about it. And she had had this very passive aggressive stepmom who she was hosting
[0:41:58] Unknown: and her dad. And so it was, you know, big dinner, again, Italian, right? So you know what that means
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_01: in terms of hospitality, so much cooking, so many courses, so many dishes, so much, right, it all
[0:42:11] SPEAKER_01: has to be just right. And so this woman kept doing really passive aggressive stuff around dishes,
[0:42:18] SPEAKER_01: you know, where she would just finish for an hour washing everyone's dishes and then she'd be like,
[0:42:22] SPEAKER_01: oh, oops, oh, I forgot I had a coffee mug in these three other plates, you know. So she would feel
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_01: like she was totally chained to the sink the whole time. And it's so funny how often we just tell the
[0:42:32] SPEAKER_01: shitty story about that person, that passive aggressive bitch is doing this on purpose to
[0:42:36] SPEAKER_01: make sure I don't get any social time with my dad and my family and blah, blah. And then we just
[0:42:42] SPEAKER_01: act out the role that they've prescribed for us and that we've prescribed for us. It's very simple
[0:42:46] Unknown: to say like, oh, okay, I just finished washing dishes for an hour. I'll let you take care of
[0:42:53] SPEAKER_01: these. Like, it's okay to say these. It's so there are a million tiny moments where you can just say
[0:42:59] SPEAKER_01: what's true for you. I'm I am so tired. I'm going to go lay down on the couch and drink some hot
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_01: chocolate with everyone. It's okay. It's really okay. And what's really fascinating to watch and
[0:43:09] SPEAKER_01: what's a great opportunity about the holidays is you get to notice the stories you tell yourself
[0:43:13] SPEAKER_01: about yourself and not just about everyone else that you need to put up with x or you need to do
[0:43:18] SPEAKER_01: y or they'll never forgive you or you need to invite so and so because how could you ever
[0:43:22] Unknown: not invite your own brother or whoever you know, you're actually allowed to make choices that are
[0:43:29] Unknown: good for you and healthy for you. Totally allowed. Yeah, maybe the first step is recognizing you have
[0:43:34] SPEAKER_00: choice. You know, we've talked about kind of that healing arc and you know, prior to recognizing
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_00: you have choice, you feel the victim of your circumstances, like things are just happening
[0:43:43] SPEAKER_00: to me, there's no way out of them. People are pushing my buttons. I can't help that, you know,
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_00: we have that experience. As we start to like heal and evolve, we recognize, oh my god, I have choice,
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_00: I have choice about how I think I've choice about how I feel. I've choice about what I do. Now,
[0:43:59] SPEAKER_00: there's some categories of life where that may seem shockingly obvious, like I can choose my
[0:44:04] SPEAKER_00: career, I can choose how I let my boss treats me. And then perhaps when it comes to your family,
[0:44:09] Unknown: it becomes murkier because of your pain bodies and your belief systems. So maybe at first,
[0:44:15] SPEAKER_00: you can just have this leap of faith moment where you're listening to us and you're like,
[0:44:20] Unknown: okay, choice exists. Now part two is, if I don't choose what's up, right, what's underneath that,
[0:44:28] Unknown: in other words, there are going to be moments, I am telling you from personal experience only,
[0:44:35] Unknown: where you know you have choice and you don't choose better. You know, you still choose to do
[0:44:41] SPEAKER_00: that same holiday that makes you crazy or to be around that same friend that drains you every day
[0:44:47] SPEAKER_00: because you just have to. And then that gives you the opportunity to see where the Velcro is,
[0:44:52] Unknown: to kind of see where the pain bodies are. So for example, I think I talked about it when I was
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_00: talking about this mold illness and like moving from Miami, but I probably should have left weeks
[0:45:04] SPEAKER_00: ago, you know, what this environment really is not good on my health. But it was my family and it
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_00: was my belief systems around family and my husband and making people happy that kept me here. Now,
[0:45:16] SPEAKER_00: Kieran as my mentor was fighting energetically with me tooth and nail to be like, you've got to
[0:45:21] Unknown: just go, like just go. And I wouldn't do it. I saw I wouldn't do it. She saw I wouldn't do it.
[0:45:28] SPEAKER_00: There was no delusion present whatsoever. It was just no, this pain body was not ready to let go.
[0:45:37] SPEAKER_00: It was still in contraction. There was no ripeness. And then she offered me what,
[0:45:42] SPEAKER_00: you know, I think was the most helpful advice and it's kind of changed everything for me. And,
[0:45:47] Unknown: and I hope it can change things for all of you. But she said, great. Okay, you're not going to
[0:45:52] Unknown: shift this. It's not right. So just be aware. Yeah. Just be aware of it as it's happening.
[0:45:59] SPEAKER_00: You know, and I was, and then that changed things like, oh, this is so incredible. I know we have
[0:46:06] SPEAKER_00: choice. I know that when I think people are going to reject me or abandon me or that I'm responsible
[0:46:13] Unknown: for someone's happiness, I know that's not true. cognitively, right? Even though I have these
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_00: unconscious belief systems that cling to that level of truth, I know it. And I'm not breaking
[0:46:25] Unknown: out of it. I'm going to still play this out a little bit. And that's okay. And if I can change
[0:46:32] Unknown: it, and if you can, and it's right, do, because that's why choice exists. And what's right for
[0:46:37] Unknown: you is right for everyone. That's interconnectivity. And if you can't observe, because in the awareness,
[0:46:44] SPEAKER_00: especially when you can have that warm, gentle touch of like, okay, this is just what it is,
[0:46:49] Unknown: this is how we work as humans, it then shifted. And it softened. And I had to go through a little
[0:46:56] Unknown: more, because that was the path I took. But there wasn't another path for me. As far as I was as far
[0:47:03] Unknown: as my system was concerned. This was what it could do. And it's huge. Yes, it's huge. Yep.
[0:47:11] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. We don't need to pile drive through everything all at once, you know, and Kieran's
[0:47:17] SPEAKER_01: words to me lately, she keeps saying, you know, we have all of eternity to shift this stuff.
[0:47:23] Unknown: We don't need to rush, you know, you're laughing because you know exactly why she would say that
[0:47:29] Unknown: to me. It's true. It's relieving. It's like, oh, I don't need to like, eradicate all of my egoic
[0:47:36] Unknown: belief structures in one handy stroke of a magic wand. That doesn't need to happen.
[0:47:43] SPEAKER_00: And maybe we can add that there were certain phases in my own like, healing journey,
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_00: like my own awareness journey, where I couldn't be around my father. There were certain phases,
[0:47:56] SPEAKER_00: where he was really agitating to me, where I couldn't be around my mother, or I couldn't be
[0:48:02] Unknown: around a certain friend or whatever the case may be. And then there's other phases where that's
[0:48:07] SPEAKER_00: fine. Totally is fine. Like, don't get so rigid and afraid that one thing means everything.
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_00: And that's forever. Forever. That's again trying to create predictability. And what that does is it
[0:48:19] SPEAKER_00: scares us because we're like, if I let myself feel these feelings, or I say no to this holiday,
[0:48:24] Unknown: or I say no to the dishes, or I take a pass, if I can't be around this person for now, it feels
[0:48:31] Unknown: like I've lost this relationship, or I'm giving up on someone or it'll go too far. And really,
[0:48:38] SPEAKER_00: that's not the case. Yes, there are other people involved, and we can't speak for them.
[0:48:44] Unknown: But the general statement in terms of reality is like, everything comes in phases, everything ebbs
[0:48:50] Unknown: and flows. And so don't predict tomorrow based on how you feel today. That's the delicious yes,
[0:48:57] SPEAKER_00: right? Like, so in this present moment, what's best for you to do? Is it to fly in on Christmas
[0:49:04] Unknown: Eve and leave on the 26th? May not always be like that. But right now, that's what's right.
[0:49:11] Unknown: Is it to take a hall pass? Maybe that's right. And if we can all trust life and trust a little bit,
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_00: which is hard, that's what belief systems are the opposite of trust. But if we can work with
[0:49:27] Unknown: that principle of trusting life, then we can start to actually moment by moment shape how we're
[0:49:37] Unknown: connecting with these wonderful tribes of ours. I love it. Happy holidays, everyone. Let us know
[0:49:44] Unknown: how it goes as you toy around with these things. We're such Debbie Downers all the time.
[0:49:52] Unknown: No, we're not. There was good stuff in this one. It's gonna be fun. Enjoy. It's precious.
