[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls.
[0:00:08] SPEAKER_00: You're listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:09] SPEAKER_00: I'm Brooke Thomas and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:14] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're talking about being on the embodied spiritual path and what does
[0:00:19] SPEAKER_00: that actually mean?
[0:00:20] SPEAKER_00: What's a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:22] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes,
[0:00:28] SPEAKER_00: the bliss and the grit that is a human life?
[0:00:32] SPEAKER_00: We're attempting to sort that out for ourselves as we go along in each episode.
[0:00:36] SPEAKER_00: In today's show, we're talking about chasing happiness.
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_00: So we're a culture of happiness chasers, as in racing towards that thing in the future
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_00: that is going to deliver the feeling of happiness.
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: But how is your actual life, your actual feelings and your actual shit, so the stuff happening
[0:00:56] SPEAKER_00: now and not in some magical future, the real path to contentment in our lives?
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: As Chogam Trungpa Rinpoche said, are you trying to liberate yourself from yourself or are
[0:01:08] SPEAKER_00: you willing to really see yourself?
[0:01:11] SPEAKER_00: Because it turns out, as Vanessa and I have discovered for ourselves many times, you actually
[0:01:18] SPEAKER_00: can't hide from yourself.
[0:01:19] SPEAKER_00: So we all want the same very normal human thing, which is for life to not suck.
[0:01:23] SPEAKER_00: And what we're saying is that the path to life sucking less is to get really honest
[0:01:27] SPEAKER_00: and to feel all the feels.
[0:01:29] SPEAKER_00: Or as Vanessa says, there's no way through but in.
[0:01:32] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, well, we would be delighted if you left a review for us on
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_00: iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit.
[0:01:40] SPEAKER_00: You can also head over to blissandgrit.com and subscribe to hear any updates on upcoming
[0:01:44] SPEAKER_00: events that we have.
[0:01:45] SPEAKER_00: We will be having some goodies for the community.
[0:01:50] SPEAKER_00: And one last note, as you can tell, because I already slipped in a little profanity in
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_00: the intro, we have potty mouths.
[0:01:56] SPEAKER_00: So if there are kids around or if you're at work, you might want to wear some headphones.
[0:02:00] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:02] Unknown: Hey, beautiful.
[0:02:03] Unknown: Well, hello, darling.
[0:02:07] SPEAKER_00: So we put out an episode very recently on grief and despair.
[0:02:12] SPEAKER_00: And you and I are both a part of traditions and we work with teachers who are of the embodied
[0:02:17] Unknown: path.
[0:02:20] SPEAKER_00: So I wanted to get into that a little bit more today because one of the things we touched
[0:02:24] SPEAKER_00: on in the grief and despair episode was that we're in a culture of happiness and a culture
[0:02:31] SPEAKER_00: of succeed, achieve, you make your own happiness, you make your own path.
[0:02:39] SPEAKER_00: There's so much nuance to this stuff.
[0:02:41] Unknown: But basically, there's a lot of like mask wearing.
[0:02:47] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot of you're good if you have six pack abs or make six or seven figures
[0:02:56] SPEAKER_00: a year.
[0:02:58] SPEAKER_00: And here's how.
[0:02:59] SPEAKER_00: Here are the goals.
[0:03:00] SPEAKER_00: Here's the path.
[0:03:01] SPEAKER_00: And so what we're talking about can sometimes be a little less appealing, let's say, at
[0:03:07] SPEAKER_00: first glance, particularly on places like social media and such.
[0:03:12] Unknown: Because what we're saying is like, you don't get to go up and away from the muckier emotions.
[0:03:19] SPEAKER_00: That's why we call the show Bliss and Grit.
[0:03:23] Unknown: And to deepen in is the way.
[0:03:27] SPEAKER_00: So there's a normal desire, human desire to not want to suffer, to not want to feel painful
[0:03:34] SPEAKER_00: emotions, and to want to have the things you genuinely desire, things that people might
[0:03:41] SPEAKER_00: wrap up in the umbrella term of happiness, but that we can say are maybe just genuine
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_00: human longings and desires about what calls to you for your particular path, what feels
[0:03:55] SPEAKER_00: transformational about your own life.
[0:03:56] SPEAKER_00: And so what we're saying is the way to that is that you have to actually face your own
[0:04:01] SPEAKER_00: shit.
[0:04:02] SPEAKER_00: So I'd like to read a couple quotes, and then we can dive in and see where we go.
[0:04:06] SPEAKER_00: And honestly, I just don't think that it's possible for us to do too many episodes on
[0:04:10] SPEAKER_00: this topic.
[0:04:12] SPEAKER_00: Because a lot of what you and I are doing with our work is challenging the assumptions
[0:04:16] SPEAKER_00: of the self-improvement, self-help industries.
[0:04:21] SPEAKER_00: So the first quote comes from Adyashanti.
[0:04:26] SPEAKER_00: And the quote is, your life, all of your life, is your path to awakening.
[0:04:32] SPEAKER_00: By resisting or not dealing with its challenges, you stay asleep to reality.
[0:04:36] SPEAKER_00: Pay attention to what life is trying to reveal to you.
[0:04:39] SPEAKER_00: Say yes to its fierce, ruthless, and loving grace.
[0:04:44] SPEAKER_00: I fucking love that.
[0:04:46] SPEAKER_00: Adyashanti is just like, here's the sword, I'm gonna cut right through the bullshit.
[0:04:52] SPEAKER_00: I love that.
[0:04:53] SPEAKER_01: But he sprinkles in this word ruthless.
[0:04:56] SPEAKER_01: Like it's nothing.
[0:04:57] Unknown: Like there's, oh, just ruthless.
[0:05:00] SPEAKER_01: I know, just, you know, and loving.
[0:05:02] SPEAKER_00: Sprinkled in.
[0:05:03] SPEAKER_00: And it's grace.
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_01: And you know, it's also nice.
[0:05:05] Unknown: It's grace.
[0:05:06] Unknown: And then the other quote you actually just put up on our Facebook and Instagram pages
[0:05:12] Unknown: today, but it's Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, beloved teacher of ours.
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_00: The quote is, many people try to find a spiritual path where they do not have to face themselves,
[0:05:22] SPEAKER_00: but where they can still liberate themselves.
[0:05:24] SPEAKER_00: Liberate themselves from themselves, in fact.
[0:05:27] SPEAKER_00: In truth, this is impossible.
[0:05:29] SPEAKER_00: We cannot do that.
[0:05:31] SPEAKER_00: We have to be honest with ourselves.
[0:05:33] SPEAKER_00: We have to see our gut, our real shit, our most undesirable parts.
[0:05:38] SPEAKER_00: We have to see that.
[0:05:39] SPEAKER_00: That is the foundation of warriorship and the basis of conquering fear.
[0:05:45] Unknown: Boom.
[0:05:46] SPEAKER_00: Drop the mic.
[0:05:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:05:49] SPEAKER_01: CTR can drop the mic a lot.
[0:05:51] SPEAKER_00: He is a mic dropper.
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_01: He has a lot of drop the mic moments.
[0:05:56] SPEAKER_00: So, when you and I maybe post these kinds of things, we get a lot of the people who
[0:06:02] Unknown: listen to the show and engage with us responding in very kind of nourishing ways, I would say,
[0:06:10] SPEAKER_00: meaning they're getting things out of it and we're getting things out of what they're saying to us.
[0:06:15] SPEAKER_00: And then, of course, there are people who maybe find us via hashtags on Instagram.
[0:06:19] SPEAKER_00: Hashtag spiritual quote.
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_00: And they want to see, like, believe and you will achieve.
[0:06:26] Unknown: And they're not delighted with what we're posting.
[0:06:30] Unknown: So, I want to speak to that mindset a little bit because we can go down the path of happy, happy, joy, joy.
[0:06:39] SPEAKER_00: And we're really just a dog chasing her own tail.
[0:06:42] SPEAKER_00: And I would say what I have seen in other people's lives and for sure what I know in my own experience is if I delude myself from the unpleasant things
[0:06:50] SPEAKER_00: and I'm chasing my own tail of happiness, what I tend to see in terms of results is that my life gets a lot.
[0:06:58] Unknown: My life gets a lot murkier.
[0:07:02] Unknown: It actually gets more unpleasant.
[0:07:07] Unknown: Was that a period?
[0:07:08] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[0:07:09] SPEAKER_00: You're done with that.
[0:07:10] SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm going to I'm going to lob that one over.
[0:07:12] Unknown: I've talked a lot.
[0:07:14] SPEAKER_01: That's just a little more about that.
[0:07:16] Unknown: But yeah, so I feel like just listening to the beginning.
[0:07:23] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to be like, oh, my head's like kind of exploded and there's all of these branches into different directions.
[0:07:30] Unknown: I guess the first thing that I want to say, you know, I don't feel like I don't feel like I know the big T truth that everyone should believe.
[0:07:41] Unknown: I'm not antagonistic against other people's beliefs and experiences.
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_01: I can only speak to what my experience is right and what I can recognize is truth for myself.
[0:07:53] Unknown: And what's true for me is I spent many years trying to transcend myself like Chagall pointed out, like get away from it, get away from the negative emotions,
[0:08:08] SPEAKER_01: get away from being a person with needs because that was just despicable to have needs and I didn't want that happening anymore.
[0:08:16] Unknown: You know, trying to get to somewhere right.
[0:08:20] SPEAKER_01: Like craving mystical experiences, craving.
[0:08:27] SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I guess some idea of heaven isn't that like wasn't heaven some kind of a nice, like comforting little nook and cranny idea that it's like,
[0:08:37] SPEAKER_01: oh, I can get there and then everything will be, as you said, happy, happy, joy, joy.
[0:08:40] Unknown: So I spent a good number of years on going in that direction.
[0:08:47] SPEAKER_01: And I don't think anything resolved for me, as you were saying with your life.
[0:08:50] Unknown: It's like I stayed anxious, like just as anxious.
[0:08:56] Unknown: I would dip into severe despair.
[0:09:03] SPEAKER_01: I guess what what really happens when you start to think about these kinds of things.
[0:09:09] SPEAKER_01: So I have a good friend who is of the choose happiness camp.
[0:09:14] Unknown: You know, like you just have to choose it that every day you choose it, which, you know, when you hear that logic, like I do get it.
[0:09:21] SPEAKER_01: Like, do you get the concept that like, yes, you have to focus on.
[0:09:25] SPEAKER_00: And I think that there's a real nugget of truth in it.
[0:09:28] SPEAKER_00: The trick is, is it coming from source or is it coming from your ego?
[0:09:32] SPEAKER_00: And if it's coming from your ego, it's going to be a troublemaker.
[0:09:35] Unknown: And that's where I think these things start to fall apart because you can look at a teacher I was just mentioning before when we spoke, Mugee.
[0:09:44] SPEAKER_01: Now, if you listen to Mugee, he doesn't I haven't heard him yet say the word to choose happiness, although he might have.
[0:09:49] SPEAKER_01: But he's more in alignment with like, just why are you thinking about shitty things?
[0:09:54] Unknown: Like, you know, your mind is your ally and like turn its attention towards this beautiful life and this water coming out of the faucet.
[0:10:02] SPEAKER_01: You know, Tichknot Hanh may he never says avoid emotions or anything, but he certainly would have you turn towards what you're grateful for.
[0:10:11] Unknown: We can get that.
[0:10:13] Unknown: And we can get that someone who's really awakened like someone like Mugee really does.
[0:10:24] SPEAKER_01: See the world that way.
[0:10:27] SPEAKER_01: The dilemma is probably we can link back to the episode we did on Karma.
[0:10:33] Unknown: Is that many of us, most of us have karmic seeds of pain, of suffering, not just our own.
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_01: I mean, our lives oftentimes have been filled with that kind of stuff because most of our parents didn't know how to communicate well.
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_01: Most of them didn't know how to love well.
[0:10:51] SPEAKER_01: Most of them didn't know how to relate to themselves well.
[0:10:54] SPEAKER_01: And then certainly not to others.
[0:10:56] SPEAKER_01: So that's probably most of us.
[0:10:59] SPEAKER_01: But then we can go back and we can look at all the intergenerational trauma that has been passed down the karmic ladder to us.
[0:11:07] SPEAKER_01: So here we are.
[0:11:08] Unknown: And many of us start off with all of this suffering woven into our system or built into our system as we kind of go through this life.
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_01: So then all of a sudden, you know, here we are and we're 28 and we're like, I'm just going to choose happiness.
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to look back at my past.
[0:11:27] Unknown: I don't want to look at what my parents did.
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to care about what happened to my grandparents.
[0:11:31] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to worry about what happened to me when I'm five.
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to deal with the fact that I have a part of myself that hates myself.
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_01: I'm just going to choose to be happy.
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_01: And it's false.
[0:11:45] Unknown: It's a denial.
[0:11:46] SPEAKER_01: It's not an awakening.
[0:11:47] SPEAKER_01: Mujee had an awakening and he's pointing you towards truth, which is, yes, everything's empty.
[0:11:52] SPEAKER_01: Why are you assigning this meaning to your life?
[0:11:54] SPEAKER_01: Why are you letting your narratives call the shot?
[0:11:55] SPEAKER_01: But he's coming from a place where he's already had that awakening.
[0:11:58] Unknown: Most of us, when we start to get into that mind frame of you shouldn't focus on these quote unquote negative emotions and you should be grateful and happy all of the time.
[0:12:10] SPEAKER_01: Most people who are spouting that are still coming from a place where they're a person divided, which is the good person who's going to choose to be happy.
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_01: And the bad human part that it has to drag along or put in a box so that it shuts up because it's not playing the game right.
[0:12:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:12:30] Unknown: And I would say if you're a part of the point zero zero zero one percent of the population who has so little painful conditioning and so little painful karmic and ancestral conditioning that you're able to just drop your negative thoughts and become awake.
[0:12:48] SPEAKER_00: Do that.
[0:12:49] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_00: But you are an extremely small percentage of the population.
[0:12:54] Unknown: So what happens is that most of us with our pain bodies and our conditioning and our history and our family history and our ancestral history and all that stuff, what we do is we wear a mask and the mask is a it's a issue of tense.
[0:13:11] Unknown: So Mooji is saying, why are you concerned with all that stuff?
[0:13:15] SPEAKER_00: Because he's only here now.
[0:13:17] SPEAKER_00: There is no future.
[0:13:19] SPEAKER_00: There is no future ever.
[0:13:22] SPEAKER_00: Never.
[0:13:23] Unknown: It's always a fantasy.
[0:13:25] SPEAKER_00: And so awakened people are operating from that place of they're not suffering.
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_00: I'm using air quotes because they're still all the normal human stuff of, you know, when your partner dies, you're not going to be able to do anything.
[0:13:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, when your partner dies, you grieve, your heart feels sad, but they're not suffering from the delusion of the mind.
[0:13:45] SPEAKER_00: The choose your own happiness and I'm going to put my pain in a box so I don't have to see it camp is aspiring towards some better place in the future.
[0:13:57] SPEAKER_00: They are only chasing a delusion because the future is 100 percent of the time.
[0:14:03] Unknown: Delusion.
[0:14:04] SPEAKER_00: Not to say that we can't project like, OK, if I started my degree in economics, I can project forward that because I want this now, I'll finish my degree in economics.
[0:14:13] SPEAKER_00: That's totally normal.
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_00: But actually, we don't know.
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_00: You know, we don't have any idea what's going to happen between what you think is going to happen and what's going to actually happen because it hasn't happened.
[0:14:25] SPEAKER_00: So.
[0:14:27] SPEAKER_00: Tense becomes critically important.
[0:14:30] SPEAKER_00: Being only in the present tense is the definition of being an awakened person.
[0:14:34] SPEAKER_00: But we have these little minds that keep telling us stories about the past and the future and the past and the future, and we're shackled to them.
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_00: The work that we're trying to do is to.
[0:14:47] SPEAKER_00: Unbind ourselves from them or see see the mind as the useful tool that it is, but not the only filter through which we see reality.
[0:14:55] SPEAKER_00: And.
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_00: The more that we decide we're going to go somewhere in the future where we are better, life is better.
[0:15:03] SPEAKER_00: We've achieved some goal that's going to give us what we think we want.
[0:15:07] SPEAKER_00: It's just delusion.
[0:15:09] SPEAKER_00: We're just escaping ourselves.
[0:15:14] Unknown: Yeah, well said.
[0:15:15] SPEAKER_01: I think the timepiece is something I hadn't thought of and is so relevant.
[0:15:20] SPEAKER_01: Is this is this a good point to talk about how annoying it is that people say they're awakened?
[0:15:25] Unknown: Yeah, it is.
[0:15:28] Unknown: That's another thing that we're going to say over and over and over and over again.
[0:15:33] Unknown: I mean, can I just talk about my pet peeve for a second?
[0:15:36] SPEAKER_01: And people are realized people are awake.
[0:15:38] SPEAKER_01: When I had my awakening, I'm like, can you not?
[0:15:41] SPEAKER_01: You didn't have an awakening.
[0:15:43] SPEAKER_01: And I know it because you're still suffering quite intensely.
[0:15:47] SPEAKER_01: Quite intensely.
[0:15:48] SPEAKER_01: So thank you.
[0:15:50] SPEAKER_01: Rant is over.
[0:15:51] Unknown: I think that you had mentioned that we're talking about embodiment in that in a way it's addressing the cult of self-improvement.
[0:16:01] Unknown: But it's not just that it's the spiritual traditions that have focused on transcendence.
[0:16:07] Unknown: And I actually don't mean to malign the traditions themselves.
[0:16:12] Unknown: I think what I mean to point towards is the Western egoic brain getting a hold of a spiritual tradition and then co-opting it according to its egos drives.
[0:16:26] Unknown: So when we start to look at spiritual traditions, we can see.
[0:16:33] SPEAKER_01: There's almost nothing a Western mind loves more than to transcend and get out of this shithole or to be better than like I will transcend as if I can leave behind everyone and be some special person who's not experiencing what all you other people are experiencing that mucky stuff like I'm so sorry.
[0:16:56] SPEAKER_01: And then maybe I'll rise up and I'll help you people, you know, like because I'm from on high.
[0:17:01] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:17:02] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you know, like because I'm nice like that cultural disease of narcissism takes hold of everything.
[0:17:07] SPEAKER_01: And I'll do I'll do you a service and I'll help you out.
[0:17:10] SPEAKER_01: But I think that what's really happened in a way why I think the embodied traditions are actually being talked about a lot now is as an antidote.
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_01: And this happens all of the time.
[0:17:23] SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you look at the collective unconscious, it's like the pendulum begins to swing, you know, how teachers talk.
[0:17:30] SPEAKER_01: They're really antidotes to where we've begun to go off truth, right off the path to truth.
[0:17:36] SPEAKER_01: So it's like we have all of these beautiful traditions where a melting pot.
[0:17:41] SPEAKER_01: It's so wonderful.
[0:17:42] SPEAKER_01: We can study things from all over the world and everyone can find something they resonate with.
[0:17:47] SPEAKER_01: But what a lot of people actually point towards, there have been Buddhist teachers who point towards this.
[0:17:52] SPEAKER_01: There have been indigenous people who point towards this.
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_01: Carl Young used to point towards this.
[0:17:58] SPEAKER_01: It is different to enter a spiritual tradition after you've already had 20 years of thinking and breathing and feeling a different way.
[0:18:08] SPEAKER_01: It's an interesting ballgame.
[0:18:11] SPEAKER_01: You know, when when the spirituality of the land is the one that you resonate most with, like your ancestral spirituality,
[0:18:21] SPEAKER_01: you've kind of immersed in that experience.
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_01: You you understand emptiness has nuance that, for example, emptiness is nothingness, but emptiness is possibility.
[0:18:34] SPEAKER_01: You understand that that is not something to despair over.
[0:18:38] Unknown: That is something to be like in awe of and and like excited by.
[0:18:44] SPEAKER_01: So when you grow up with that spirituality, you get all of these nuances and paradoxes and they're pretty clear or clearer.
[0:18:53] Unknown: We should say it's more it's more part of your everyday.
[0:18:57] SPEAKER_01: When you come out of the blue into a spiritual tradition, particularly if you don't have a guru who's breathing down your neck,
[0:19:05] Unknown: it's very easy to read a book and read it through the lens of what your ego wants.
[0:19:13] Unknown: It's the only thing that is possible.
[0:19:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because you have your ego goggles on.
[0:19:17] SPEAKER_00: You don't know it. You just think that's everything.
[0:19:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly right. And neurobiologically, that is just the way it's like your brain is going to filter everything it encounters through what it knows from the past.
[0:19:29] SPEAKER_01: So you're not drawing upon this like ancient tradition from your familial lineage or from the land itself.
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_01: You're really reading it with the mind of Vanessa, who's been exposed to the cult of self-improvement and lives in a country where happiness is a right and you have to choose it.
[0:19:48] SPEAKER_01: And if you don't have it, you're not that great and vulnerability sucks and independence is everything.
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_01: So now I bring that Vanessa, that persona, that lens, that's just part of my wiring because I'm in an ecosystem and I read these ancient teachings and I bring that to it.
[0:20:06] Unknown: And I read it how I want to read it without meaning to, of course.
[0:20:10] SPEAKER_01: So I think that's where some of the dilemma starts to get in.
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I think I don't know when we mentioned it, but I know at some point we talked about Locke Kelly.
[0:20:20] SPEAKER_01: So Locke Kelly kind of had this proposition that from his experience of awakening to truth, that there's these three different movements of energy.
[0:20:29] SPEAKER_01: You would wake up, wake out and wake in.
[0:20:33] SPEAKER_01: Wake up means something like, sorry, Locke, to put words in your mouth, but something like recognizing transcendence and connection with everything.
[0:20:42] SPEAKER_01: Waking out means to feel that heartfelt connection and interconnectivity with all beings.
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_01: And waking in is the embodiment.
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_01: It's really like from our perspective, it's really in and down.
[0:20:57] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:20:58] Unknown: Right.
[0:20:59] SPEAKER_01: So when I saw that, I thought that makes so much sense to me.
[0:21:03] Unknown: And what he pointed to, kind of the way Judith points to the same thing, is like people will go with what they're most comfortable with.
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_01: So if you're comfortable waking up because you don't have to suffer, you don't have to feel, you don't have to be a human, you don't have to really be present,
[0:21:20] SPEAKER_01: deal with Trump being your president, deal with the fact that like we're actually killing our earth and we have been for a really long time.
[0:21:27] SPEAKER_01: Like if you don't want to deal with any of that, well, then by all means, you're going to focus real hard on waking up.
[0:21:33] SPEAKER_01: You're going to concentrate there.
[0:21:35] SPEAKER_01: Yep. Right.
[0:21:36] Unknown: Get me out. Up and out.
[0:21:38] Unknown: And you'll even have disdain, perhaps, for the paths that point you in and down or into the heart.
[0:21:46] Unknown: And so in this way, this is where like it gets tricky because I don't know what I can't see either.
[0:21:53] SPEAKER_01: So I understand I really value in and down and I'm like, well, am I missing something?
[0:21:57] SPEAKER_01: You know, am I still scared to go up or, you know, I don't think so.
[0:22:00] SPEAKER_01: But I always keep a pretty loose grip on that kind of stuff.
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_01: But I do believe that the vast majority of people find it safer to get out, to go up.
[0:22:12] Unknown: Don't you?
[0:22:13] Unknown: Yeah. Well, I think it's what we see.
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_00: I mean, so even if we're removing it from the spiritual path, which spiritual is one of those also tricky words,
[0:22:21] SPEAKER_00: the egos co-opted a million different ways.
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_00: What we are talking about is the willingness to completely surrender to giving birth to what your true self is and knowing that you don't know.
[0:22:35] SPEAKER_00: So even if we remove it from the spiritual path, we can just see that everyone wants up and out of whatever their everyday life circumstances.
[0:22:43] SPEAKER_00: So it's just like that Adyashanti quote.
[0:22:45] SPEAKER_00: He's saying your life is your path, you know.
[0:22:48] Unknown: So it's like, OK, I have financial problems.
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm looking at my bank account and it's like, not only am I not earning enough money, but I also I'm just not good with money.
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_00: Like, let's say I'm a person who's having this realization as somebody who has had this realization many times.
[0:23:03] SPEAKER_00: Like, I'm also not good at it.
[0:23:04] SPEAKER_00: I don't understand how to save and budgeting doesn't seem to be going great for me.
[0:23:09] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes I overspend and then I tighten the belt and I'm the good girl.
[0:23:12] SPEAKER_00: And OK, so I'm acknowledging having this moment of acknowledging money and I it's it's not the most clear, thriving relationship.
[0:23:22] SPEAKER_00: So what I could do in an up and out self-help way is to go, OK, goal, future goal.
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_00: Immediately, I'm jumping from the problem up and out to that imaginary place called the future.
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_00: Here's my goal. I'm going to earn X dollars a year.
[0:23:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to budget like this.
[0:23:41] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to read these three books on investing.
[0:23:44] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to go to that seminar.
[0:23:46] SPEAKER_00: So it's all like I'm going to put things in my brain that are going to help me to improve this pattern.
[0:23:52] SPEAKER_00: All these things are fine.
[0:23:53] SPEAKER_00: And I've done them a million times.
[0:23:56] SPEAKER_00: But the problem comes when we're captivated with this story that it's going to work out the way I think it's going to work out in the future.
[0:24:03] SPEAKER_00: So I can just the same engage in the exact same thing in a down and in way.
[0:24:09] Unknown: So down and in way would be like acknowledging the same thing.
[0:24:14] SPEAKER_00: Me and money have this thing.
[0:24:16] SPEAKER_00: And this is what I noticed when I look at my bank account and my habits financially.
[0:24:19] SPEAKER_00: I could do the same thing. Oh, look, these three books just came my way.
[0:24:23] SPEAKER_00: I would like to read them. I have a genuine desire to read them.
[0:24:26] SPEAKER_00: Now, maybe I get halfway through the first book and I go, I have an insight.
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_00: Oh, my God, my issues with under earning have nothing to do with me spending more time earning a living.
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_00: It has everything to do with my orientation towards a pain body that says no matter how hard I work and I have to work hard, my needs will never get met, which is one of my classic pain bodies.
[0:24:46] SPEAKER_00: That's insight that can change everything in that moment.
[0:24:51] SPEAKER_00: I didn't have to spend five years learning investment strategies and increase my work week from 60 hours a week to 100 hours a week, because that would have only been an investment.
[0:25:04] SPEAKER_00: Intensifying the pain body, which says I'm going to have to work my ass off because that's how life goes.
[0:25:09] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to be miserable and I'm still not going to get my needs met.
[0:25:12] SPEAKER_00: So that's the life is a mirror thing where I would just keep creating that circumstance because I didn't give myself a chance to go down and in and have a really true insight.
[0:25:21] SPEAKER_00: I believed in the lie of future tense Brooke, who's on top of the mountain.
[0:25:26] Unknown: Look at me. I did it.
[0:25:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And if you want to get really up and out, you would just say I'll manifest that shit.
[0:25:37] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's when we really want to go to delusion.
[0:25:40] Unknown: What I'm going to do is just sit in my room and envision me rolling on.
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to write a number down.
[0:25:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm thinking of the always sunny in Philadelphia episode where their vision boarding.
[0:25:55] SPEAKER_00: It's so good. He's like, I'm going to impregnate Danica Fitzpatrick.
[0:26:00] SPEAKER_00: It's like all these superspecific things, but they're not doing anything except getting drunk in their bar every day.
[0:26:04] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to have a yellow Lamborghini.
[0:26:07] Unknown: That's so great. Oh, my God. Yeah.
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_01: So that would be the ultimate if you want to get really, really away from just being human.
[0:26:16] SPEAKER_01: Well, you know, I just feel like I guess I can't say it enough these days.
[0:26:20] SPEAKER_01: Like be human, be human, be human.
[0:26:22] Unknown: And I say it, I grasped onto it.
[0:26:25] SPEAKER_01: I mean, because Reggie would say it.
[0:26:27] SPEAKER_01: And then also I've heard now a lot of native teachers I've been listening to indigenous teachers say it.
[0:26:34] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, OK, so here's an antidote for our times is to be human.
[0:26:39] SPEAKER_01: But I say it because it was an antidote to me.
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_00: Me too. Obviously. I mean, I have totally fallen for all of these things.
[0:26:46] SPEAKER_00: And I continue, obviously, to have to notice and untangle when I'm doing it.
[0:26:51] Unknown: Yes, because I'm not awake.
[0:26:53] SPEAKER_01: Super. I want to be superhero like, I mean, you know, I want to be like some zen genie that just like floated like,
[0:27:01] SPEAKER_01: like I never had anything but spaciousness for people and I'm never in a bad mood.
[0:27:06] Unknown: And why? So we've talked about this before.
[0:27:10] SPEAKER_01: But why is because I didn't feel like feeling the pain I had.
[0:27:14] SPEAKER_01: I didn't want to feel the anger I had.
[0:27:16] Unknown: I didn't want to deal with what may arise if I let those feelings come in.
[0:27:21] Unknown: Right. So a couple of things that I was afraid of, let's say because, OK, I remember being.
[0:27:28] Unknown: Let's been in my mid 20s, maybe the first time I was starting therapy.
[0:27:34] Unknown: I remember I was always friends with a lot of people who had kind of these like difficult childhood circumstances.
[0:27:43] SPEAKER_01: It makes me laugh now because I remember thinking, but I had a pretty normal time.
[0:27:52] SPEAKER_01: And that's how denial works. Right.
[0:27:55] SPEAKER_01: So I had a really but my childhood was so easy. It's so interesting.
[0:27:58] SPEAKER_01: I'm so attracted to people with such, you know, mixed circumstances.
[0:28:02] Unknown: That's fascinating. Actually, I always envied them.
[0:28:05] SPEAKER_01: I thought, oh, gosh, you understand the world so much.
[0:28:08] SPEAKER_01: It's like very weird of me. But there was.
[0:28:11] SPEAKER_01: And then, of course, I started to go to therapy and I started to realize.
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_01: Really, the depths of pain I had stored, you know, and I'm a very intelligent person and I've always been a very inquisitive person.
[0:28:25] SPEAKER_01: So I employed a very commonly used defense mechanism.
[0:28:29] Unknown: I hear it all the time. Well, why should I be mad at them?
[0:28:32] SPEAKER_01: They did their best. It's like, you know, no one's perfect.
[0:28:36] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's not like I was locked in a closet.
[0:28:39] SPEAKER_01: It's not like I'm in war torn Africa. Who am I to be upset?
[0:28:43] Unknown: I should just by now just be over it.
[0:28:47] Unknown: And that's what I wanted.
[0:28:50] Unknown: Now, that's a very common wish.
[0:28:53] SPEAKER_01: And I don't begrudge anyone the wish.
[0:28:55] SPEAKER_01: I still wish I could sometimes like snap my fingers and like untie some knot that's in my system.
[0:29:02] SPEAKER_01: But but what's happened is it's never worked.
[0:29:06] Unknown: There's never been a time where I could just let it go because my intellect or my defense or my ego thought that would be easier.
[0:29:17] SPEAKER_01: It never works and it never works for anyone.
[0:29:20] SPEAKER_00: No. And we tell ourselves that it does when we're more used to doing that.
[0:29:27] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. You become numb at a certain point.
[0:29:30] SPEAKER_00: You become deeply numb to the fact that you're doing it and that it's not successful.
[0:29:34] SPEAKER_01: It's a it's a good point, Brooke, because you can look at life in a few different ways.
[0:29:39] Unknown: Like how would how would this manifest in a way that's detrimental to you?
[0:29:45] SPEAKER_01: OK, so let's say I was to avoid my feelings. What's the problem?
[0:29:48] SPEAKER_01: Right. That's really the question.
[0:29:50] Unknown: Like if I was to avoid having insight, feelings, awareness, what's the problem?
[0:29:56] SPEAKER_01: Because let's say it like this.
[0:29:59] SPEAKER_01: Like I didn't want to have certain awarenesses.
[0:30:01] SPEAKER_01: I didn't want to realize how I had felt about some of the choices my parents made because I didn't want to be in conflict with them.
[0:30:08] SPEAKER_01: I didn't want to be selfish. I didn't want to be bad.
[0:30:11] SPEAKER_01: I didn't want to confront the depth of my own agony because I didn't want to cry and I don't want to fall apart.
[0:30:17] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to lose my shit. You know, and I've talked about that before.
[0:30:20] SPEAKER_01: We feel like we're going to like lose our ever loving shit.
[0:30:22] SPEAKER_01: So I don't really want to go in. So then, all right, what are my options?
[0:30:27] SPEAKER_01: So instead, I'm going to try to get over it.
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_01: I'm just going to try to like move past it, focus on the good, focus on what makes me happy, create some shit and like move past it.
[0:30:37] SPEAKER_01: OK, so what could possibly go wrong?
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: Seems like a good idea, especially since most of us are in a position of privilege in terms of the human race on this globe.
[0:30:47] Unknown: Right. Well, a couple of things.
[0:30:50] Unknown: One, I never got rid of the despair.
[0:30:53] Unknown: So I'd go manic high and then super low.
[0:30:57] Unknown: What's the point? I felt empty because I wasn't connected to myself.
[0:31:02] Unknown: I felt like I must be faking something kind of just because I wasn't present to myself.
[0:31:09] SPEAKER_01: My love relationships kept mirroring the fucking real beliefs, not the ones I kept spouse like espousing through my mouth, but the real ones.
[0:31:22] SPEAKER_01: So I think when you start to look at like what could go wrong, like you were saying, there's some people who are so good at it that they're numbing out.
[0:31:29] SPEAKER_01: We can look at two sides of this equation.
[0:31:32] SPEAKER_01: One is we can feel a lot of these emotions that overtake us.
[0:31:36] SPEAKER_01: So you're doing well, but then all of a sudden you're in a pit of despair.
[0:31:39] SPEAKER_01: You're doing well, but all of a sudden you're binging and drinking and like falling apart or you're doing well.
[0:31:44] SPEAKER_01: And all of a sudden you're screaming your face off at someone and threatening to punch them.
[0:31:48] SPEAKER_01: OK, so on the one hand, there's this emotional fallout from actually just shoving emotions down rather than meeting them and loosening them.
[0:32:00] SPEAKER_01: And then on the other, for people who do go numb, you'll see it in your life.
[0:32:04] SPEAKER_01: It's the mirror. Yeah, something will be awry.
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_00: You actually can't hide from your shit. You cannot hide.
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_01: You actually can't. You're making a lot of money, but your relationships are unfulfilling.
[0:32:14] SPEAKER_01: Maybe everything's perfect, but you're dead inside and you're drinking like something is going to show that is the whole fucking point of karma is like meet your shit.
[0:32:27] Unknown: So you don't have to like have worse consequences because everything gets so like gunky when you try to just go in the go against the flow, so to speak.
[0:32:39] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, so in the end, what we're doing is kind of coming full circle.
[0:32:42] SPEAKER_00: We're saying, yes, we all want the same very human thing, which is for life to not suck.
[0:32:48] SPEAKER_00: And what we're saying is the way to life sucking less is to meet what's actually going on in your reality, your actual tangible reality.
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_00: What is your job? Who are your friends?
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_00: How does your house look? I'm laughing because my office is a fucking mess that I'm sitting in right now.
[0:33:09] SPEAKER_00: And then also your emotional reality, like what are the things that you would rather not have to feel?
[0:33:14] Unknown: And, you know, that Adyashanti quote that I started with, like, I just want to circle back to that a little bit because he says he's basically saying there's nothing that's not beautiful seed for your life to unfold, which is totally the whole path that we're on.
[0:33:31] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing that's a problem. Ultimately, it's all just there for you to meet it and then see what happens when you meet it.
[0:33:38] SPEAKER_00: So like in the financial example that I gave, like the fact that this past tense, Brooke was looking at her bank account and going, well, I really suck at money.
[0:33:49] Unknown: You know, this is really a problem. It's not a problem. It's just information.
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_00: It's just an opportunity to see what is being reflected in the mirror, which is I'm going to have to work really, really hard in life.
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_00: And even then, I still don't get my needs met. That's really amazing nugget to uncover, because once you uncover that, you're on to your own game.
[0:34:11] SPEAKER_01: And once you're on to your own game, what did you say? Awareness really is it? Like, I guess for years I wondered, how do you change? It's awareness.
[0:34:20] SPEAKER_01: Awareness is the beginning. It's the whole alchemical agent. Yes, there's stuff after awareness, but like right there, if you're not aware of the problem, how can anything shift?
[0:34:29] SPEAKER_00: Exactly. And then once you are on to your own game, you can't not see it. You'll have moments where you're not on top of your game fully.
[0:34:36] SPEAKER_00: But what I'll realize is, like for me, now, if I'm thinking about a work project, what I notice is that I always choose the path of most effort, least reward.
[0:34:48] Unknown: Always. It's where I automatically go. But I'm on to my game now, so I can go, oh, do I really need to drive three hours each way to make less money than I would make if I just sat in my beautiful house and created a new house?
[0:35:05] SPEAKER_00: And created this project I'm excited about? No, because I'm on to my game. But before I would fracture myself, my time and energy into a million tiny pieces and nothing would ever happen, because all I'm doing is just unconsciously going through the motions of I'm going to have to work really hard.
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_00: And even then, my needs won't get met. I'm going to have to work. You know, it's like you have to just get hip to your own game. So I could not have done that by vision boarding my way to my future.
[0:35:33] SPEAKER_00: I tried for a very long time. So I'm not doing this to say, you know, shame other people. We all try because we all want to not suffer. Duh. It sucks. It hurts.
[0:35:47] Unknown: There is no get out of jail free card. That's just the way of it.
[0:35:53] Unknown: Yeah, it's funny having chosen Chagam Trungpa as like a teacher of mine because I used to read his books and get half depressed because he was always like, there's no hope.
[0:36:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I love that Pema Chodron quote where she's like, why couldn't, it's one of my favorite stories of hers that sticks in my head forever.
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_00: Why wouldn't we just make that into an inspirational poster? The phrase abandon all hope is the most inspiring thing I've ever heard. And when I first read that, I was like, oh my God, it is.
[0:36:23] SPEAKER_00: You thought so. That is good. It caught me at a very dark time in my life.
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_00: But what I had seen, what I saw in that moment when I think it was when in her book, When Things Fall Apart, was like, oh my God, hope.
[0:36:39] SPEAKER_00: As in this striving towards my imaginary future is what has gotten me into all of my fucking messes.
[0:36:46] Unknown: And if I had abandoned all hope and just acknowledge what was actually happening in this each moment as each moment unfolds, I wouldn't have created such a mess.
[0:36:56] SPEAKER_01: Exactly. And the hope really is that I can get out of this. I can get away from being human.
[0:37:03] SPEAKER_01: Imperfect, having emotions, carrying family lineage stuff. Like that's the hope that we have to stop hoping for.
[0:37:11] SPEAKER_01: And really that there's some kind of permanent reality in which we're always going to feel good because life is changing. And that was a flawed hope. Right.
[0:37:21] SPEAKER_01: But I used to read that. I hadn't had my first disillusionment yet.
[0:37:26] SPEAKER_00: You got to. You have to have been dashed on the rocks or else you're going to be like, I don't.
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_00: These bitches are crazy. Why are they talking about having no hope?
[0:37:35] SPEAKER_00: We're here for those of you who have been dashed on the rocks already. OK, that's what we're doing.
[0:37:40] Unknown: If you haven't, just, you know, trust your older folks. No, I'm just kidding.
[0:37:46] SPEAKER_01: So it really used to depress me. But I couldn't stop reading. I couldn't get torn away because it really felt true. It always felt really true.
[0:37:58] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I like to say there's no way through but in.
[0:38:01] SPEAKER_01: And we learned this. This wasn't something we wanted or something we chose.
[0:38:09] Unknown: It was something we learned. And, you know, we've talked a lot about how we learned that the other way doesn't work. Right.
[0:38:15] Unknown: We learned that just trying to cling to a delusion or trying to like fix yourself, like going to war with yourself is such a common strategy.
[0:38:25] SPEAKER_01: We've learned all of that is not going to work.
[0:38:28] Unknown: And we've learned the opposite, that when we go in, we're actually moving through.
[0:38:36] SPEAKER_01: And it's such a funny thing to describe, like how all of a sudden a quote really makes sense to you, like the way abandon all hope all of a sudden clicks.
[0:38:45] Unknown: Like the other day, I don't know if I said this to you. Maybe I did.
[0:38:50] SPEAKER_01: There's this Joseph Campbell quote I always loved.
[0:38:54] SPEAKER_01: He said something like, people are looking for meaning in life. They think they're looking for meaning in life.
[0:39:00] SPEAKER_01: He said, but what I really think they're looking for is an experience of being alive.
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_01: And I loved that quote. I've always loved that quote. Oh, what beautiful words should Instagram that. Right.
[0:39:13] Unknown: Lovely. I get it now. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[0:39:19] Unknown: That's what like going in and through is like I get alive. I get alive. Yeah, I get like not 100 percent of me is like happy to just be human.
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_01: I still have a certain percentage that would like to be a mystical creature that like flies above, you know, reality with like fairy dust.
[0:39:36] Unknown: But let's say a solid 90 to 95, which is a huge accomplishment for me, is so into being human now, like feeling it all.
[0:39:47] Unknown: Like you never read Zorba the Greek, did you? I did. Of course. I've been friends with you for so long.
[0:39:53] SPEAKER_01: I think you've given me two copies of it. You know how often I was just ranting about Zorba last night to somebody because, you know,
[0:40:02] SPEAKER_01: people were pathologizing him because he didn't want to fall into mediocrity in his life.
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_01: Like, anyway, Zorba came up. So if you haven't read Zorba for any of you haven't read Zorba the Greek, which is probably most of you,
[0:40:16] SPEAKER_01: it's written by a guy who's a Buddhist and it's a reflection because Zorba is an amalgam of real people.
[0:40:23] Unknown: And so there's these real Greek men who have this like zest for life, this lust for life, like they're so alive,
[0:40:30] Unknown: they're going to meet every moment full, present, showing up with everything. Right.
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_01: So he's really reflecting on here I am sitting on a cushion meditating, you know, reading these scholarly books that are pretty dry and I'm doing my mala and everything.
[0:40:49] SPEAKER_01: And there are these people and they're drinking in life with like so much reverence and and and enjoyment.
[0:40:58] Unknown: And which one is more spiritual? That was his big question.
[0:41:03] SPEAKER_01: Like, which one is more honoring of life? And I don't say that to answer the question for anybody.
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_01: I think it's just a beautiful exploration. But this way that it's like, I think what's happened for me
[0:41:18] SPEAKER_01: is as I've gone in. So what do I mean by go in a couple of things? And you can say what you mean, Brooke.
[0:41:23] SPEAKER_01: But the embodied meditations are one way that I've gone in.
[0:41:27] Unknown: In the beginning, Reggie's work and then Judith's meditations and then some of Kieran's meditations.
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_01: But all about like showing up in each and every one of your cells and in each and every one of your muscles and in each and every organ and seeing what's there,
[0:41:44] SPEAKER_01: like just making space for what's there. And that kind of gave rise to the things that I had stuffed down the issues in my tissue.
[0:41:53] Unknown: So that's one way I go in. We don't live in denial anymore that way.
[0:41:58] Unknown: The other way therapy, talking, counseling, energy work sometimes when I've got an energy work.
[0:42:06] Unknown: But all of these different ways that we're making space for what is hidden to come to light, making the unconscious conscious.
[0:42:19] Unknown: That's what I really mean by there's no way through. But in what would you add to that inquiry?
[0:42:26] SPEAKER_00: You know, so for me, using Byron Katie's work has been tremendously helpful.
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_00: I think a lot.
[0:42:35] SPEAKER_01: I think a lot.
[0:42:36] SPEAKER_00: I just want to say before we complete this conversation that another thread of that I want to underline this.
[0:42:48] SPEAKER_00: A thread of this conversation is that a part of what we want is the easy way out.
[0:42:54] SPEAKER_00: What I am not saying is too bad. Suck it up. Take the hard way.
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_00: What I'm saying is going in and through is the easy way.
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_01: It is the easy way.
[0:43:07] SPEAKER_00: The hard way is to delude yourself and create more and more and more messes in your life.
[0:43:11] SPEAKER_00: I know I have done it like a fucking Olympic champion.
[0:43:17] SPEAKER_00: And what I realized is these these future tense ideas that I'm chasing after are making a mess of my life.
[0:43:24] Unknown: Not feeling the feelings I'm actually having, not sitting with myself is making my life way harder.
[0:43:31] SPEAKER_00: So the easy way is to be, to use Adyashanti's words, ruthless and loving about what is true for you.
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_00: And what I've discovered is that you can do that with hard mental energy where you're like projecting this mental laser and what's not true?
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_00: What am I in denial about?
[0:43:50] SPEAKER_00: That's not what I'm talking about.
[0:43:52] Unknown: It's actually quite loving to, like you were saying, go in your body, use a somatic meditation, and just make space.
[0:44:02] Unknown: That's it. You're not there to solve a problem.
[0:44:04] SPEAKER_00: And then life unfolds from there.
[0:44:06] SPEAKER_00: That's what amazed me is that like it was like opening all of the dams on myself.
[0:44:13] SPEAKER_00: And then actually suddenly things were workable.
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_00: Suddenly I could see things like, oh, that's on my head.
[0:44:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm just doing that pain body over and over and over again.
[0:44:21] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm not. But I am, obviously.
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_00: I see it now. When you can see with clarity, life gets really easy.
[0:44:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And it gets more enjoyable because you're present.
[0:44:30] SPEAKER_01: And so all of a sudden that breeze is really scrumptious.
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And that laugh you hear is like so touching.
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_01: So it also gets really enjoyable when you allow yourself to just stay with what is.
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_01: I had this saying in my head.
[0:44:45] SPEAKER_01: OK, I don't know if you're going to think this is as funny as I am.
[0:44:48] SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm ready. Lay it on me.
[0:44:50] Unknown: As you were talking. I shouldn't even say it.
[0:44:54] SPEAKER_01: I was thinking stop, drop and feel.
[0:44:57] Unknown: Oh my God, no. It's perfect.
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_00: And we have to make t-shirts.
[0:45:04] SPEAKER_00: It's like being body. Just like get low. Feel all the feels.
[0:45:11] SPEAKER_01: Stop, drop and feel the feels. And then you can deal.
[0:45:15] Unknown: Oh no, it keeps rhyming. Stop, drop and feel. And then you can deal.
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_00: It's like a PSA. It's fucking great.
[0:45:23] SPEAKER_01: It is a PSA. I so wish we could PSA this. Well, we are. But even bigger.
[0:45:29] Unknown: Everyone can hear it. Trump should stop, drop and feel for a year.
[0:45:35] SPEAKER_01: And then we'd be in a better position.
[0:45:37] SPEAKER_00: He would be in agony. That's a lot of agony that's been stuffed in there.
[0:45:41] SPEAKER_00: It's a lot of paint layers to go through.
[0:45:44] SPEAKER_01: Yes. So is this good news, everybody? I don't know. What do you think?
[0:45:48] SPEAKER_00: I think so. I think it's fucking great news.
[0:45:51] SPEAKER_00: But the proof is in the pudding. You know, try it out.
[0:45:56] SPEAKER_00: See what happens in your own life. You can't just believe us. You have to go for it.
[0:46:00] SPEAKER_00: It's just a personal experience of if I actually feel what I'm feeling and I'm honest about it or honestly inquire,
[0:46:06] SPEAKER_00: is that true? Is that thought that I keep having true? You know, that I'm unlovable or that my bank account is a problem?
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_00: Is it true? And follow it all the way to the end with as much support as you can find.
[0:46:17] Unknown: Listening to podcasts is awesome. But real people in the real world, having a sangha, people you can talk to,
[0:46:24] SPEAKER_00: having a teacher you can talk to, having a coach, having a mentor.
[0:46:29] SPEAKER_00: These are the ways that we get unhooked from ourselves. You know, we're not meant to be in isolation.
[0:46:35] Unknown: Stop, drop and feel. Stop, drop and feel. That's your public service announcement of the day.
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_00: And then you can deal. And then it's all real.
