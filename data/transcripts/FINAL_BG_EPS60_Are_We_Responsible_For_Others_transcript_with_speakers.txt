[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Brooke Thomas and I'll be
[0:00:10] SPEAKER_01: joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto. On the show, we are talking
[0:00:16] SPEAKER_01: about being on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that even mean? What is a real
[0:00:20] SPEAKER_01: evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and crazy,
[0:00:26] SPEAKER_01: the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is human life? So just in time for
[0:00:34] SPEAKER_01: the holidays, we are rolling out the age old question, am I responsible for others? It's
[0:00:40] SPEAKER_01: a trickier question than at first glance, and it can be utilized and lived out in a
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_01: myriad of ways. We can wear it as a weighty mantle where we're carrying others on our
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_01: backs. We can take an I know better than others and can control or fix or sort things out better
[0:00:56] SPEAKER_01: than they can kind of approach. And we can also, of course, swing the pendulum to the opposite
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_01: extreme and say that, well, if everyone is living their life just as they should, if everyone has
[0:01:08] SPEAKER_01: free will and there's no mistakes and I'm not in control of anything, well then I can just let go
[0:01:14] SPEAKER_01: and let God and I'll be over here hiding out as the transcendent one, otherwise known as spiritual
[0:01:20] SPEAKER_01: bypass. So if we can't fix, control or save people, and if doing the spiritual person disappearing
[0:01:29] SPEAKER_01: act also is not helpful, what does genuine responsibility to one another look like? How
[0:01:35] SPEAKER_01: that plays out is not really something that we see modeled very much in our world. If you're
[0:01:41] SPEAKER_01: enjoying the show, we would be thrilled if you could leave us a review on iTunes or on our
[0:01:45] SPEAKER_01: Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit, and you can also head over to the website, which is Bliss
[0:01:49] SPEAKER_01: and Grit.com and subscribe. We set out a Friday newsletter with all kinds of goodies, resources
[0:01:56] SPEAKER_01: that we're loving, things like that. And the last thing before we head into the conversation, if
[0:02:02] SPEAKER_01: you're new here, Vanessa and I swear, so headphones people, headphones if you need them. Okay, here
[0:02:08] SPEAKER_01: we go.
[0:02:11] SPEAKER_01: Hi, Brooke.
[0:02:12] SPEAKER_01: Hello, Vanessa.
[0:02:13] Unknown: You know, one of the great pleasures of working with people for a living, being a coach is you
[0:02:23] SPEAKER_01: constantly get in your own mirror, all of the little crunchy edges that you may still be stuck,
[0:02:31] Unknown: or you get really interesting things that arise for you to explore in your own life. So recently, in
[0:02:41] Unknown: several different clients that I've been working with, the concept of feeling responsible for
[0:02:49] Unknown: others well being has come up. This isn't new. It's probably, I don't know, 60 70% of my clients
[0:03:00] Unknown: would feel that way, you know, and I certainly have a very deep history around feeling responsible
[0:03:07] Unknown: for other people. It still lingers. But now it's more like a cloud that comes past the sun rather
[0:03:13] Unknown: than feeling like reality itself to me. But I guess what got me really deeply exploring it again in
[0:03:22] Unknown: myself was a story that a client of mine was telling me, as she was in that moment feeling deeply
[0:03:30] Unknown: responsible for taking care of her family in this way that feels to all of us, all of us, that we
[0:03:36] Unknown: sort of heavy like sort of wavy, when we're in this kind of a storyline, like, I feel responsible
[0:03:44] SPEAKER_01: for them, and somehow it doesn't feel right. And somehow it feels thick, and almost obligatory, not
[0:03:51] SPEAKER_01: that this person use that word, but it carries that energy. And as we were sorting through it
[0:03:56] Unknown: together, and I was, you know, expressing that it's not her responsibility to take care of other
[0:04:02] SPEAKER_01: people, what she was bringing to the light was all of the times when something wouldn't have changed
[0:04:08] Unknown: in her family, unless she had said something, or had done something. And it really got me thinking
[0:04:17] Unknown: about that, because I think that's true for many of the soul seeking types that come in front of me
[0:04:27] Unknown: expressing that they feel responsible. Somewhere along the line, it was true that had they not
[0:04:37] SPEAKER_01: stepped in with their skills, or their personality, or their gifts, whatever we would call it,
[0:04:44] Unknown: something wouldn't have realigned itself in their family system, or in their peer group, or at their
[0:04:51] SPEAKER_01: job. So it, in part, reinforces this belief system, like, I am responsible for how other people
[0:05:00] Unknown: feel, I am responsible for others well being. But on another side, do we have any responsibility
[0:05:09] Unknown: for others? I mean, does that even exist? It's like I was saying to you before we started recording,
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_01: if I was walking in the forest taking a lovely stroll, and someone was drowning in the pond in
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_01: front of me, and I was capable of diving in and swimming to them, I certainly wouldn't be like,
[0:05:29] Unknown: that's not my responsibility. Right? If my child was hungry, I don't have a child, but if I did,
[0:05:37] SPEAKER_01: I certainly wouldn't be like, not my responsibility, you know, you're God's kid now, you know.
[0:05:42] SPEAKER_01: And if my plants, if my garden was thirsty, again, I would certainly step up and take care.
[0:05:50] SPEAKER_01: So I thought that this exploration around responsibility, especially in the context
[0:05:57] SPEAKER_01: of spirituality, turned out to be a little juicier and more nuanced than I was thinking.
[0:06:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like we're going to get into or the things that come to mind for me are
[0:06:13] SPEAKER_01: identity, you know, when we identify as the one who like the one who saves others, the helpful one,
[0:06:25] SPEAKER_01: the good one, the one who's responsible, you know, then we keep just recreating that role.
[0:06:33] SPEAKER_01: And also, of course, co-dependence has to come to the party, because that's essentially what
[0:06:38] Unknown: we're talking about, is that pattern. And like you said, you know, there can be these moments where
[0:06:46] SPEAKER_01: it was true, right? So all we have is moments, but we shrink wrap them as large chunks of time
[0:06:54] SPEAKER_01: that have and then we import them with meaning and then we say, like that, and forever, you know. So
[0:07:00] Unknown: let's say there was a moment, like I can think about a friend of mine who was engaged once and
[0:07:09] Unknown: I felt really concerned about the person and, and I said to her, you know, I love you,
[0:07:16] Unknown: and I'll support you no matter what. And, you know, if you choose this, I think you're choosing a
[0:07:23] SPEAKER_01: really hard life. Like, that's a hard thing to say to somebody who you love really dearly.
[0:07:27] SPEAKER_01: And she wound up not marrying that person. And I could very easily identify as that being
[0:07:32] SPEAKER_01: something that I did. But I certainly did not have anything to do with her choice.
[0:07:41] SPEAKER_01: And how her life plays out, what I did have was this moment where this kernel of truth arose.
[0:07:49] Unknown: And it really wanted to be spoken. And I said it in the most loving way I possibly could.
[0:07:57] Unknown: And that was right alignment for me. And it served, you know. But it, it's not that
[0:08:07] Unknown: if I hadn't done that, you know, I definitely know her life would be terrible or, you know,
[0:08:16] SPEAKER_01: thank God I said that or anything like that's when I'm starting to make it this larger
[0:08:22] SPEAKER_01: thing. But really, it's like we are all living out our lives. And so all we can do is respond
[0:08:30] SPEAKER_01: to the authentic moments, which might say something like, please voice this, you know,
[0:08:36] SPEAKER_01: but then people do whatever they do with that information. Like also with my mom.
[0:08:43] Unknown: When I was 16, I was just like, I'm done. Caretaking, because my mom, at that time,
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_01: was an alcoholic. You're supposed to say they're always an alcoholic, but she's been sober a long,
[0:08:56] Unknown: long time. But I was totally done. And it would be so easy. And then she went to rehab and she
[0:09:03] SPEAKER_01: got sober. It'd be so easy to say like, thank God for me, you know, thank God I said I'm not
[0:09:08] SPEAKER_01: doing this anymore. You're on your own. Because I am responsible for making that happen. That is not
[0:09:17] Unknown: at all true. Like my mom's sobriety is 100% hers. But the only thing that I had was this one
[0:09:26] SPEAKER_01: authentic moment where something wanted to be voiced, and then I let it be voiced through me.
[0:09:32] SPEAKER_01: And then life does whatever it does with all of the variables and people live their own lives.
[0:09:37] SPEAKER_01: You know, but I could easily be like, I'm the good one. I made this important thing happen.
[0:09:45] SPEAKER_01: Did you ever feel like that? I mean, obviously, now you have insight. But do you ever think that
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_01: you sort of put that mantle on yourself?
[0:09:54] SPEAKER_01: As the the important one responsible one, like the one who sure things happen and fix things?
[0:10:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, I think when you grow up that way, then you you certainly do like you're very wired
[0:10:06] Unknown: to co dependency. I mean, for sure, for sure, for sure. But what I have found is that that's not
[0:10:12] Unknown: true, you know, that we're all just living our own lives, and we all have these, these moments,
[0:10:19] SPEAKER_01: and the more we can act in alignment in those moments, meaning whatever genuinely wants to
[0:10:23] SPEAKER_01: be said, or whatever action wants to be taken, then the more the constant ongoing timeline of
[0:10:29] SPEAKER_01: our lives can unfold in a way that is just more true and has less suffering. But it's not, I would
[0:10:40] Unknown: have to rely on the identity of the one who's responsible for fixing people's lives. I don't
[0:10:46] Unknown: know. It's funny talking about this. I'm like, wow, I really, I really don't feel that way at all
[0:10:52] Unknown: anymore, to the point that it's like kind of hard for me to remember. Yeah, like when you did grasp.
[0:10:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but certainly I lived most most of my life that way. Yes. Yeah, I do still. I mean,
[0:11:05] Unknown: I remember hearing telling me a story about how she was taking a walk with another teacher,
[0:11:12] SPEAKER_01: and the teacher said something like, Oh, I remember what it was like to carry people on
[0:11:17] SPEAKER_01: your shoulders. You know, like, as in I don't do that anymore. Yeah. And I thought, Ooh,
[0:11:22] SPEAKER_01: that sounds good. That sounds liberating. You know, I've got them kind of like, half off,
[0:11:28] SPEAKER_01: half on at this point. You know, I haven't totally chucked the bodies. But, but I remember,
[0:11:36] SPEAKER_01: you know, part part of this discussion before I go into my memory, I think that we can bring in as
[0:11:41] Unknown: as context and container is to believe you're responsible for someone's well being is, is to
[0:11:50] SPEAKER_01: believe you are directly responsible for their feelings. It's almost like, if I was to imagine
[0:11:56] Unknown: that there was a string between you and I broke, and the person who believes that myself who who
[0:12:03] SPEAKER_01: did and sometimes does still believe that it's like I believe that if I move to the left, you
[0:12:08] Unknown: move to the left. And if I move to the right, you move to the right. And there's this sense, then I
[0:12:15] SPEAKER_01: create feelings. Now, Matt Khan gave a really interesting voice to this one when he was talking
[0:12:21] Unknown: about the ego being the imagination of an overstimulated nervous system. Because what he
[0:12:27] SPEAKER_01: was saying is, you know, especially the sensitive children, especially the empathic children,
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_01: they were feeling all of this stuff in the energy field of the people around them, their beloveds,
[0:12:40] Unknown: their family. So let's just pretend I'm talking about my mother. So in this moment of relating to
[0:12:47] SPEAKER_01: mother, my mother, I'm feeling all of this stuff, maybe disappointment, maybe tension,
[0:12:53] Unknown: maybe fear, anxiety. So the feeling is coming across really loud and clear. But the interpretation
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_01: of the data, the meaning we ascribe to it, which you were pointing to in the beginning of the talk,
[0:13:05] Unknown: oftentimes becomes self referencing, like I did something. So here's this complex human being that
[0:13:12] SPEAKER_01: is my mother, you know, who has a lot of things going on in her life. She has stuff from her past
[0:13:18] SPEAKER_01: and karma. And she has stuff with my dad and her parents and, you know, friends in the world around
[0:13:24] SPEAKER_01: her. But in the moment that myself as a young being who's very sensitive feels this energy of
[0:13:31] Unknown: disappointment or lack, the first place I may go is I created disappointment. Now, especially if
[0:13:39] Unknown: I was unlucky enough to have done something in that moment, not put my toys away, said something
[0:13:45] Unknown: fresh, as my mom would say, whatever the case may be that she was having that feeling set. Or if I
[0:13:53] Unknown: triggered a pain body of hers by not listening to her, that that sense that this is about me gets
[0:14:00] Unknown: more crystallized. And it starts to become, I guess, a structure that I believe is real in the
[0:14:10] Unknown: sense that I created that feeling in her. And I begin to feel, in a sense, a bit omnipotent.
[0:14:18] SPEAKER_01: That's what we would say. It's like, I create all the feelings in my mom. So if I'm good,
[0:14:23] SPEAKER_01: she gets to be happy. And if I do these x, y, z good behaviors, we get to be in right
[0:14:29] SPEAKER_01: harmonious relationship. But if I am bad, and I do these upsetting behaviors, she will be unhappy,
[0:14:38] Unknown: we do not get to be in right relationship. So this is really the earliest underpinnings, as far as I
[0:14:45] SPEAKER_01: can tell. And I was certainly that child. And my parents fueled that, as many collectivistic cultures
[0:14:53] SPEAKER_01: will, you know, my family is like, if you didn't do something they were happy with, they thought
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_01: you were selfish. You know, if you did something they liked, they rewarded you if I did something
[0:15:02] Unknown: they didn't like, I was punished, you know, there was a lot of conditioning available to help shape
[0:15:10] SPEAKER_01: this already tendency of me as a young HSP to assign self blame. There was all the information
[0:15:17] SPEAKER_01: in the world to say, Well, yes, in fact, it's your job to take care of us when we're older. And like,
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_01: you you light us up. And if you're bad, we feel like everything we've dedicated to this role and
[0:15:31] Unknown: identity of parent is for not. That was the sense I got. So, you know, I go to therapy, my 30s, and
[0:15:40] Unknown: I am feeling I can I can remember this feeling directly responsible for their well being,
[0:15:47] Unknown: and dreadfully unhappy that I didn't perceive them to be happy. You know, I didn't perceive them to
[0:15:54] Unknown: have the kind of relationship that one would want to have, ie, I would want to have. I didn't perceive
[0:16:02] Unknown: them to be spiritually connected, or connected to meaning in life outside of parenting.
[0:16:11] SPEAKER_01: So I was sort of lamenting over how unhappy my parents were, and how unhappy that made me,
[0:16:18] SPEAKER_01: like I couldn't be happy if I couldn't save them. So you see like, many, many layers of
[0:16:24] SPEAKER_01: belief systems in there, that they're unhappy, that their life isn't meaningful to them,
[0:16:29] SPEAKER_01: that I can't be happy unless they're happy, leave no one behind. And that I have to then
[0:16:37] SPEAKER_01: save them, as if we could save a person. I'm not even sure what that really means. But there it was.
[0:16:45] Unknown: And somehow, in this therapy session, I had this experience, it was this giant, beautiful humbling,
[0:16:55] Unknown: where I recognized that these were two people who had lived their lives, you know, they were
[0:17:02] Unknown: 35 years older than me. So they were like, something like that. They were in their 60s already.
[0:17:08] SPEAKER_01: And they had survived the deaths of their parents, and they had survived the birth of three children,
[0:17:13] SPEAKER_01: and like, got us through life, and all the various traumas that arise. And, you know, I was like,
[0:17:20] SPEAKER_01: they have their own relationship to God and to spirit, they're not left out.
[0:17:25] SPEAKER_01: It's not me and G hanging out, and then these people, like, are left out of the posse, you know.
[0:17:31] Unknown: And it was this giant humbling and recognition that by assuming this responsibility of savior,
[0:17:40] SPEAKER_01: or helpee, or fixer, I was immediately casting them into this role as one who needs saving by me.
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_01: Right? As if they didn't have their own destiny and their own capacities and their own
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_01: inner subjectivity I couldn't even begin to relate to, and then their own spiritual path,
[0:18:00] SPEAKER_01: their own karmic unfolding. And that was a big revelation for me. But it was only like
[0:18:07] SPEAKER_01: untying of one big fat knot, not all the tiny, tiny little ones where I'm still working at those
[0:18:14] Unknown: edges of recognizing, like, how could we be responsible for another person? And how
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_01: wildly arrogant that thinking is, though none of us mean to do harm by it in the least. But
[0:18:33] Unknown: it's that absurd in the way that it's logic, that it puts us in a position above other humans, really.
[0:18:41] Unknown: Yeah. And where it's coming from, like, the root structure of it is related to believing that you're
[0:18:50] Unknown: a separate self and that your control tower thinking is responsible for making your life happen,
[0:18:59] SPEAKER_01: and that the thoughts that you have and the plans that you make are reality, even though we can all
[0:19:05] SPEAKER_01: look in every mirror of our lives and go, oh, I didn't think it would go this way. You know,
[0:19:09] SPEAKER_01: we know that there's that life's way more surprising than we ever give it credit for.
[0:19:15] SPEAKER_01: So if we believe that we're a separate self, if we believe that we are in control of our lives
[0:19:20] Unknown: through our thinking mind and concepts, then we don't hold to be true that there is a larger
[0:19:32] SPEAKER_01: intelligence that is all of it's not just like the larger intelligence helps all of us
[0:19:39] SPEAKER_01: it is all of us, it is us and everything, you know, it's every living thing. So it's all the
[0:19:45] Unknown: intelligence or source or whatever you want to call it. And that's something that, you know,
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_01: if you don't have an experience of it, of course you think like that you need to sort of grab hold
[0:19:57] SPEAKER_01: and make things happen. So it's not like I'm saying like, just let that go, you know, because
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_01: that's quite a journey. So I'm not trying to make it a small thing. But I think what happens,
[0:20:08] SPEAKER_01: especially in spiritual paths, when we're talking about the context of responsibilities,
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_01: that people can take it to the opposite extreme, like, okay, so if I know that there's a larger
[0:20:16] SPEAKER_01: intelligence, if I know that I'm not in control, if I know that it is so arrogant to think that
[0:20:23] SPEAKER_01: I'm the one that's that's responsible for making other people's lives work out, you know, or go a
[0:20:28] Unknown: certain way, then like, whatevs, you know, I'm just gonna bypass over here and, and not do anything
[0:20:41] SPEAKER_01: or think, you know, we of course swing the pendulum to the opposite extreme of just the
[0:20:46] SPEAKER_01: transcendent one. And like all these petty human problems, don't people know that the intelligence
[0:20:52] Unknown: river is just flowing through all of us? And why are you even bothering, you know, because these
[0:20:58] Unknown: are really significant, very profound, weighty, and often painful questions of the human heart and
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_01: the human life, which is that we see people we love suffering and in pain, we suffer, and we have
[0:21:10] Unknown: pain, and we want things to have less of that, right. So instead, it kind of comes back to what
[0:21:18] SPEAKER_01: I was saying before, that there is right action, you know, that the way that the intelligence works,
[0:21:26] Unknown: is that it gives us all constantly, these little gifts, these little bits of right action,
[0:21:34] SPEAKER_01: and we can behave in alignment with them. And then things will come forward things to do things to
[0:21:40] SPEAKER_01: say, you know, when we are, are operating from that, but that's very different than I need to,
[0:21:48] SPEAKER_01: you know, play this role, stick people in those other roles, like you were describing,
[0:21:53] SPEAKER_01: with your parents, you know, tell all the stories about what they must be, you know, as those
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_01: objects over there, that this object me needs to kind of control and shape and make work out.
[0:22:07] Unknown: And I've had people recently get in touch with me, who are also on the path, asking the question of
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_01: like, how much of your path do you share with your parents, or your brother, or your friends who
[0:22:26] Unknown: are not on the path? And what's underneath that question is always like, how can I get them to be
[0:22:33] Unknown: on board? You know, that's a part of it. And the other part of it is how can I be seen? You know,
[0:22:39] SPEAKER_01: how can I be seen by the people who I love the most in the world? So it's both of those things.
[0:22:44] Unknown: And, you know, it's like that doesn't, you know, share, I don't share the path, like as a
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_01: concept, right? Of like, hey, guys, guess what, it's all just the intelligence, you're gonna love it.
[0:23:02] SPEAKER_01: Right, exactly. I don't, I don't play teacher, because I think ultimately, it just comes down
[0:23:07] Unknown: to like, no, everyone is, everyone is living their lives just fine. And there's always,
[0:23:16] SPEAKER_01: especially if we're, you know, talking about the people who I love in my life, like, it's just love.
[0:23:21] SPEAKER_01: I love them as subjects of their own lives, and that I don't know, I don't know what's best for
[0:23:26] SPEAKER_01: them. I don't know what's best for their life. And they don't need to be on board with any kind of
[0:23:30] Unknown: agenda. Which just really changes the way that we operate in relationship to people.
[0:23:39] SPEAKER_01: It's really hard, because there's a couple of bits that could make that really difficult. Let's
[0:23:43] Unknown: say the first one is, sometimes their behavior really seems like it's not a good idea, you know,
[0:23:51] SPEAKER_01: drug addiction, alcohol abuse, hanging out with the wrong people, marrying someone who's very
[0:23:56] Unknown: difficult, you know, these different things. So the first bit is what happens when you see something
[0:24:03] SPEAKER_01: and it looks like a really intense path for someone. You know, how do you just sit with that
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_01: without feeling that you need to fix it, right? Like letting someone else's path unfold, because
[0:24:15] SPEAKER_01: we have to recognize free will, above all, that people have free will. And it's one of the gifts
[0:24:23] Unknown: of this. We get free will to do what we want, to handle what we're ready for, to face what we want
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_01: to face, to open certain doors, to try things on like we have free will. So I think the first part
[0:24:37] Unknown: is that sometimes it is at least seemingly apparent that we have an answer that they may not have,
[0:24:45] SPEAKER_01: right? So biting back that advice, or giving that advice in a very non-attached way.
[0:24:53] Unknown: So for example, my dad's got a heart condition, and I have lots of advice for him. I think it's
[0:24:59] SPEAKER_01: really good advice. I don't know if it will save his life longer. I don't know that he'll feel better,
[0:25:05] Unknown: but it's really sound, well-educated advice. I give it to him. He really doesn't take it.
[0:25:13] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how I've done it, but I have managed to be fairly non-attached to that.
[0:25:18] SPEAKER_01: Oftentimes, that's the point where someone runs into a difficulty. They're giving this advice,
[0:25:24] SPEAKER_01: someone's not hearing it, and that feels so frustrating or so uncomfortable. And so right
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_01: at that first point, it's like you can move how you move. If moving forward with your wisdom is
[0:25:37] SPEAKER_01: the way to go, you do it. But the practice is to be non-attached to them, taking it to have the
[0:25:43] SPEAKER_01: utmost of respect for their free will and autonomy and life path, knowing there is
[0:25:50] SPEAKER_01: always mystery we don't understand, even with the most obvious of things to our rational mind.
[0:25:57] SPEAKER_01: Then the second bit, if we can get over that hurdle, we can move the way we move, maybe give
[0:26:04] Unknown: advice, then be non-attached, is to be able to be with them suffering, but tolerate it.
[0:26:11] Unknown: Yeah. That is so hard for us. I think that's a lot of the feeling responsible for people,
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_01: is we wish we were responsible for them because we feel like we would do something better for them
[0:26:23] Unknown: and then they would suffer less. And it's just so damn hard to be with the people we love
[0:26:31] Unknown: suffering and just watch it happen, feel powerless. Yeah. And I would say,
[0:26:38] Unknown: you know, that there's, you know me, there's options to tap out. We don't have to watch them
[0:26:44] Unknown: suffer. We kill them. We don't have to have anyone in our life. There's no rule. I know people who've
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_01: had to do that. I mean, with children who they just could not watch, put the needle on their arm
[0:27:01] Unknown: anymore, you know, and family members who they just couldn't watch drown and learned helplessness
[0:27:10] SPEAKER_01: anymore. It doesn't mean that there's this hardness. I guess just what I'm trying to say is like,
[0:27:17] SPEAKER_01: when we talk about, well, first of all, that there's no rules, right? Like I'm stuck with
[0:27:24] Unknown: longing to be able to give someone the light, you know, and they can't see the light
[0:27:33] SPEAKER_01: because they're my fill in the blank, you know, and it's not necessarily true. It might be true
[0:27:41] SPEAKER_01: and there might be all kinds of juice in the relationship of how do you be with, you know,
[0:27:48] SPEAKER_01: how do you be with somebody who is headbutting a curb and committed to that path and just how do
[0:27:56] SPEAKER_01: you still love them through it? Like that might be really fruitful. So I'm not saying you have to cut
[0:28:00] SPEAKER_01: and run either. One of the most challenging things I think about being a human being, I was going to
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_01: say about the spiritual path, but really just about having a human life is that even if we can have a
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_01: direct experience or many that there is a larger intelligence working through everything,
[0:28:19] Unknown: that does not at any point mean that it gets to work out a particular way, you know, and that
[0:28:27] Unknown: there's the insta no suffering place, you know, what that means is that our lives are really
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_01: rich and surprising and filled with all kinds of interesting characters who are living their own
[0:28:45] SPEAKER_01: lives. And that we have to just let that be what it is, you know, because otherwise, like, let's say
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_01: we have someone in our life who's headbutting the proverbial curb, us trying to force them
[0:29:02] SPEAKER_01: to do something that they cannot or will not do is just us getting on the headbutt the proverbial
[0:29:09] Unknown: curb train. No, it's just adding to the more suffering buying into the insanity and like
[0:29:17] Unknown: acting as if the insanity has a place. Yeah, and it's giving giving yourself insanity, you know,
[0:29:24] SPEAKER_01: that you would spend the rest of your days desperately grasping at this situation and
[0:29:30] SPEAKER_01: trying to make it something that it's not. Instead of going like this is who this person is,
[0:29:35] SPEAKER_01: this is the choice that they're making. And I love them anyway. And love looks like this,
[0:29:41] SPEAKER_01: like love is spacious. Love lets them have their own free will.
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: Love knows that they are subject of their own lives and not an object in mind.
[0:29:52] SPEAKER_01: That's hard because oftentimes if that's the case that there's someone hitting their head against
[0:29:57] SPEAKER_01: the curb so hard that you no longer feel like you can be in in relationship with them.
[0:30:03] SPEAKER_01: Oftentimes, if that's a family member or someone very close to you, you may not have had a really
[0:30:07] SPEAKER_01: good model for what love is, you know, for how love looks that it can be that spacious and
[0:30:14] Unknown: self possessing. But, you know, I had this person say to me the other day that they were
[0:30:22] Unknown: trepidatious to go to therapy because they don't talk to their parents and they felt it was really
[0:30:29] Unknown: right for them. And they were very nervous that a therapist would push back on that and question
[0:30:36] Unknown: them. And I'm like, well, not one worth their salt unless it was right for you. You know,
[0:30:43] Unknown: like everyone gets to choose as you're saying, and this is really about your life path. And so
[0:30:50] SPEAKER_01: not unless it was right for you, should someone do that and know better than you.
[0:30:54] Unknown: And I think, you know, you're talking about oftentimes what can feel like unsolvable problems,
[0:31:02] SPEAKER_01: you know, or very difficult, very painful things. But the crazy thing about living and being a human
[0:31:07] Unknown: and being in relationship is it's hard to watch people suffer with the most mundane things.
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_01: Totally. You wouldn't cut relationships off for like,
[0:31:17] Unknown: I don't know, you know, like I worry about this is the kind of stuff I worry about. Do my mom and
[0:31:24] SPEAKER_01: dad have a good relationship to death? You know, are they going to be afraid?
[0:31:28] SPEAKER_01: I love that that's such a Vanessa thing. It's so mean. I mean, it's like all I think
[0:31:34] SPEAKER_01: about for myself. Am I ready to die? What will it be like? Will I be afraid? I mean, of course.
[0:31:39] Unknown: So I think about it with them, you know, and I think, do they feel happy? Like, are their hearts
[0:31:44] SPEAKER_01: happy? Do they feel like they have meaning? You know, like basic things. Why is my mom always
[0:31:49] SPEAKER_01: making herself crazy? You know, how unnecessary or like, oh, there's my dad yelling again. What
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_01: are those two going to do with each other? You know, so there's like, those are sort of mundane.
[0:32:01] SPEAKER_01: They're not. It's never been ripe enough to push away a relationship. But man, it's hard to sit
[0:32:09] SPEAKER_01: with and just recognize it. And they have a right to their life. Yeah. You know, they have a right
[0:32:14] SPEAKER_01: to their life. They have a right to the relationship they chose. They had a right to make family the
[0:32:20] SPEAKER_01: front and center for them. You know, they have a right to their life. But this is the other
[0:32:25] SPEAKER_01: interesting angle that you've begun to touch on a little bit. And I just wanted to get to is,
[0:32:31] Unknown: do we have a responsibility? You know, and if so, what? So sort of the beginning of this conversation,
[0:32:38] SPEAKER_01: we're talking about this kind of weighty mantle of responsibility we place on that's
[0:32:44] SPEAKER_01: quite a delusion that's baked in misunderstanding and innocence, where we really think we're somehow
[0:32:51] Unknown: linked to people's well-being and that we and only we have the capacity to save them and that
[0:32:57] SPEAKER_01: we're bad if we don't and the world's going to fall apart if we don't. Right. So it's, it's the
[0:33:02] SPEAKER_01: sort of mantle that feels quite heavy when you're in relationship to it. It can feel really weighty,
[0:33:08] SPEAKER_01: can feel really obligatory. We can notice we're prone to guilt or shame. We may even want to push
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_01: the people away because we feel guilty and then we feel guilty that we push them away. And it can
[0:33:20] SPEAKER_01: look a lot like that. So that's relationship as an identity or this misunderstanding that I am
[0:33:27] SPEAKER_01: responsible for how other, I'm sorry, I didn't mean relationship as an identity. I meant responsibility
[0:33:32] SPEAKER_01: as identity based on this kind of misunderstanding that I, Vanessa, am responsible for how other
[0:33:39] SPEAKER_01: people are feeling. But then we have, do we have any responsibility to our families, to our communities,
[0:33:46] Unknown: to our world? Are we responsible at all? You know, if you see something, say something. Yeah. But that
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_01: happens in your family all the time. Like you see something, it's fucked up. Right. Well, that's
[0:34:00] SPEAKER_01: different because that's still the object relationship. Like, what are you doing about over
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_01: there? So yes, I think we have a responsibility every microsecond of every moment that we are
[0:34:10] SPEAKER_01: alive to act in what is right alignment for us. If we're the kinds of people who want to be on a path
[0:34:20] SPEAKER_01: of whatever you want to call it, wakefulness, awareness, sanity, healing, whatever, personal
[0:34:28] SPEAKER_01: growth, call it what you will. If we want to be the ones who aren't sleepwalking while we're here,
[0:34:32] SPEAKER_01: then we have a responsibility to do that. The trick is, you know, and of course we have free will to
[0:34:39] SPEAKER_01: choose to do that or not. And not just as a long-term shrink wrap thing, but you know, in any given
[0:34:45] Unknown: moment. And we will do all, you know, we will do both. And then the trick is how do we know what
[0:34:52] SPEAKER_01: does alignment feel like? What does right action feel like versus manipulative object-based,
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_01: fix-it, control tower-based stuff? And you know, that's not something that I can give a cute
[0:35:09] SPEAKER_01: one-liner for. I mean, maybe a more senior teacher would be able to, but I think that it's about
[0:35:14] Unknown: developing over time a very, very intimate relationship with ourselves and with reality.
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_01: I would use those words interchangeably, ourselves and reality, so that we know what right action is
[0:35:29] Unknown: in a moment. Like if I were to rewind the tape to that moment where I said that to that friend and
[0:35:36] SPEAKER_01: to that moment where I said that to my mother, those were right action. Like, because I know
[0:35:42] Unknown: what it felt like in my being. There was no constriction. There was no fear. There was no
[0:35:50] Unknown: grasping. It was just like the space opened, the words came out. It was totally my truth.
[0:35:59] Unknown: And so, you know, it served. I'm not saying we're going to do that perfectly, but you know,
[0:36:05] SPEAKER_01: and then I also, speaking of the funny little things that make us crazy, like my mom has
[0:36:10] Unknown: a food allergy to dairy and she has celiac disease. Oh my God, she just refuses to ever
[0:36:19] SPEAKER_01: read a freaking food label and she, you know, eats not all the time, but dairy and gluten and
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_01: then gets sick. And I spent years trying to like educate, just read the label. Most processed food
[0:36:33] SPEAKER_01: is going to have something in it. Look at the bottom, it says allergens and it'll say dairy
[0:36:39] Unknown: and wheat, you know, just look. And, you know, that horse didn't want to drink that water. And so
[0:36:47] SPEAKER_01: there was this moment where what was in alignment, what really came through was this moment where
[0:36:52] SPEAKER_01: we were in the kitchen and I was about to point out that thing that you're cooking with is dairy
[0:36:58] Unknown: based, you know? And I was like, why? And something on a gut visceral level, it was like a fist
[0:37:07] Unknown: unclenched. And I was like, she's my mom. She gets to do what she wants. Obviously she doesn't
[0:37:14] Unknown: want to read labels. She wants to eat what she wants to eat. She wants to eat what she wants to
[0:37:20] SPEAKER_01: eat. So that was a moment of right alignment as well. That was a moment of right alignment of not
[0:37:25] SPEAKER_01: doing something, of not acting. So those moments are there all of the time. And I think that we
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_01: have a responsibility to them. And what that boils down to is that we have a responsibility
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_01: if we care to be here having these kinds of conversations, if we don't want to sleep walk
[0:37:40] SPEAKER_01: through our lives, we have responsibility to develop a deep and intimate relationship with
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_01: ourselves and to do our own work of unveiling ourselves so that we can have more and more
[0:37:51] SPEAKER_01: alignment in our lives. Yeah, I had a teacher once, he was a supervisor when I was in school,
[0:38:01] Unknown: I was my internship to become a psychologist. And I think I've told you about this before,
[0:38:08] SPEAKER_01: but he said, if you're trying to figure out whether to say something to a client or not,
[0:38:13] SPEAKER_01: because of course, in this case, we really when we're doing client work of any kind,
[0:38:19] SPEAKER_01: we really can struggle up against our feeling responsible for them. Like, you know, I got to
[0:38:25] SPEAKER_01: make them well, I have to give them what they need, or I have to help them or be there, whatever,
[0:38:29] Unknown: whatever variety that you want to take. And so he said, if you're trying to imagine if it's
[0:38:34] SPEAKER_01: right to say something to someone, perhaps to point out that their relationship isn't healthy,
[0:38:40] SPEAKER_01: or that this is in reference to their mom, or whatever the case may be, he would say,
[0:38:45] SPEAKER_01: picture it, like really take a breath, get in your body and picture saying it. And if it
[0:38:53] SPEAKER_01: feels right, like you could imagine it, maybe it's even a little hard, like you're a little
[0:38:58] SPEAKER_01: trepidatious, but you could see it, you can feel it, and it feels right, then something's right,
[0:39:04] SPEAKER_01: for you and for them. But if it doesn't feel right, you can barely picture it can't imagine
[0:39:09] SPEAKER_01: saying it feels sick in your body feels, then something's not right, either for you or for them.
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_01: And I just thought, well, that may not be a perfect little tool. It's an interesting one.
[0:39:20] Unknown: And it has been a useful one for me, because you know, you were saying about how in those moments,
[0:39:26] Unknown: it just felt right. There's so many of these moments in life where we are scared or something,
[0:39:32] SPEAKER_01: even though we kind of have a gut sense of what's right for us, like intuitively,
[0:39:38] Unknown: yeah, like, I should say this to my boyfriend, or, you know, I should really address this teacher
[0:39:45] SPEAKER_01: and the way they're behaving. But it's so fucking scary, based on our programming and our patterns
[0:39:49] SPEAKER_01: and all of that, that we can't quite get to the sense of rightness yet, because the pain bodies
[0:39:55] Unknown: are whirling up a storm. And in those cases, you know, these are just little hacks, you know,
[0:40:02] SPEAKER_01: little shortcuts to try to tune you into your deepest knowing, which is what you're ultimately
[0:40:08] Unknown: pointing us towards. I mean, I was giving you the example earlier before the recording, that when I
[0:40:19] SPEAKER_01: went to Sedona, and I studied with my friend who is adopted into the native traditions, and
[0:40:25] Unknown: he was giving me the teaching on what they call the Wheel of Life. And he was saying that,
[0:40:31] SPEAKER_01: from this philosophical standpoint, we all have a unique place in the Wheel of Life, all of us,
[0:40:36] Unknown: every human, every person on this planet was born for some place in this wheel. And that it is our
[0:40:44] SPEAKER_01: sort of moral obligation to take our place in the Wheel of Life, because only when we all do that,
[0:40:51] Unknown: will there be harmony. And they say the hoop will be mended. That's the language that they use.
[0:40:58] SPEAKER_01: And I think of it, when I heard that teaching, the way I interacted with it is,
[0:41:05] Unknown: the obligation is to be Vanessa. Exactly. And to be Brooke, right? And to be Vanessa, Vanessaing,
[0:41:13] Unknown: and Brooke, Brookeing. And what's interesting is that seems to be apparently difficult for us.
[0:41:22] SPEAKER_01: We set up all kinds of, it gets funnier the farther you go into it. You're like, wow,
[0:41:27] SPEAKER_01: I really, whoa, look at that maze. Oh, what? Hall of mirrors. Yeah, like, hello. I mean,
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_01: all of these things just to be ourselves, like all of these practices, and meditations,
[0:41:38] Unknown: and vision quests, and academic degrees, and all of these things, just to be ourselves. That's what
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_01: we're talking about, people. Just to be you. It should be the easiest thing in the world.
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_01: And for right action to emerge, and you get to follow through on it. And it's not complicated.
[0:41:57] Unknown: But our conditioning is gnarly. Gnarly. And we're structured in such a way that it can make it so
[0:42:04] SPEAKER_01: difficult, depending on what we've been through. I thought it was interesting. I was listening to
[0:42:10] Unknown: this podcast with a guy who's an eco-psychologist. But he was talking about wonder. And he was talking
[0:42:18] SPEAKER_01: about how we really, really need wonder, especially like wonder in nature when we're young.
[0:42:24] SPEAKER_01: It's to be so encouraged in young people, because he was saying, you can't come to spiritual
[0:42:29] SPEAKER_01: maturity without wonder, because you'll never wonder who you are. You'll never be able to wonder
[0:42:35] SPEAKER_01: what life means to you, and what your place in the wheel would be, and what this is all about.
[0:42:41] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, oh, it's so beautiful. I know how you feel about wonder too. And so do I.
[0:42:47] SPEAKER_01: Like, oh, you're right. What's happened in a society where we've squelched our sense of wonder?
[0:42:54] SPEAKER_01: We've overstimulated ourselves outside of it, because the TV is way more captivating than
[0:43:02] Unknown: the slow-growing tree outside our front door. But I thought about it from the same sense. Here we
[0:43:09] SPEAKER_01: come again, that there's this point of spiritual maturity where the obligation we have to the world
[0:43:17] Unknown: is to be ourselves and to exist spontaneously and beautifully as expressions of our essential nature.
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_01: And that does not preclude action. That is action.
[0:43:31] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:43:32] SPEAKER_01: That does not.
[0:43:33] SPEAKER_01: And that actions will emerge, you know, things that you want to follow through on. And
[0:43:39] Unknown: you have to trust that by you taking your place at the wheel, by you being yourself,
[0:43:45] SPEAKER_01: that that is a healing thing, not just for yourself, you know, that those healing reverberations
[0:43:52] SPEAKER_01: go through everything, you know. And I feel like one of the things that I've been really lucky to
[0:43:58] SPEAKER_01: have in my life, and I'm sure you feel the same way, is that I've sat with, like literally in
[0:44:03] Unknown: the physical presence of some very awake, beautiful human beings who are teachers. And
[0:44:12] Unknown: they are so liberating just by their presence. They're not doing anything fancy if they're the
[0:44:20] SPEAKER_01: real deal, you know. But you can, you can feel how healing it is just to be in the presence of
[0:44:25] SPEAKER_01: somebody who knows how to be their being. It is profoundly healing, but because we don't see it a
[0:44:31] Unknown: ton, and because we live from our minds, we can second guess that, and that sounds like it doesn't
[0:44:37] SPEAKER_01: make any sense. But people who are being their being are very healing, and they're also taking
[0:44:47] SPEAKER_01: a lot of action. You know, they move towards the suffering of humanity. These are not the people
[0:44:53] SPEAKER_01: who are, you know, just partying all the time because who cares? It's all good with God. Like
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_01: these are the people who devote their lives to sitting with and transmuting human suffering,
[0:45:04] Unknown: including, you know, Earth suffering, planetary suffering as well.
[0:45:14] Unknown: I know it's funny how we divide that, right? Like the action thing, it comes up so often,
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_01: like then what will I do? Like what will be the action if I trust myself? And I'm like, well,
[0:45:26] SPEAKER_01: you know, the Dalai Lama seems to be pretty active in this world.
[0:45:30] SPEAKER_01: Amma seems to be getting some stuff done. Like she's pretty on it. You've seen her collection
[0:45:36] SPEAKER_01: of charities? There does seem to be a thing that as we realize ourselves as ourselves more and more,
[0:45:46] SPEAKER_01: we don't move away from the suffering. And so we don't seem to be in resistance of meeting life
[0:45:54] Unknown: and showing up to do quote unquote our part, right? But we don't carry that heavy weighty
[0:46:02] Unknown: mantle, right? There's such a difference. Like, oh, I have to save the world. People are suffering.
[0:46:08] SPEAKER_01: It's my job. I'm to be a good Christian or to be a good person or to be, you know, a good Buddhist.
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_01: I have to do all of these things. And that energy of have to and should and obligation is so loaded
[0:46:21] SPEAKER_01: into it. And so often it's just based on belief systems and lineage and and habit. And that's a
[0:46:30] SPEAKER_01: very different energy than the one that arises when we take our right place, like when we allow
[0:46:36] SPEAKER_01: ourselves the space to exist and we learn how to exist within our body, where we just want to help.
[0:46:42] Unknown: It's like, what I've come to realize is the more I've existed, the more I've had space to exist,
[0:46:51] Unknown: the more fulfilled you are. And that's a beautiful place to be. Like, I feel that on some level,
[0:46:58] Unknown: if the world wants anything from me, it's my own fulfillment. Because when I'm fulfilled and I walk
[0:47:05] Unknown: out the door, I literally talk to the trees and I give them my love and appreciation. And then I
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_01: talk to the little four legged who are like walking by and I give them morning love. And then I smile
[0:47:19] SPEAKER_01: at everyone who passes. And then I can sit with my clients in a more open space. And there's
[0:47:26] Unknown: something about, you know, this teaching where it's like, if I had all the food in the world,
[0:47:32] SPEAKER_01: and everyone was sitting at a table with me and was starving, of course, I would give it to them,
[0:47:38] SPEAKER_01: my pleasure, without any scarcity or obligation or guilt or, or tension around that movement.
[0:47:44] Unknown: Right. So the more we align with what is fulfilling to us, which is to say the same,
[0:47:53] SPEAKER_01: like the more we exist and recognize that our being is enough, more than enough, it's everything,
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_01: then the more capacity we have, and the more natural movement we have to show up in whatever
[0:48:08] Unknown: way we were designed to contribute. Yeah. And I think capacity is like a great
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_01: place to end the conversation, because just think about, you know, acting from chronic,
[0:48:20] SPEAKER_01: you know, fear, or, you know, grief, or all of that sort of manipulative grabby hands,
[0:48:28] SPEAKER_01: I need to do something, I need to save the world, I need to save those people over there, I need to
[0:48:34] SPEAKER_01: make something happen is so exhausting, you know, we're so limited when we're acting from that place.
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_01: But I've found that the more my system because it feels literally like my body, you know, the more
[0:48:49] Unknown: it opens and opens and opens, and the more spacious it is, really, the more capacity I have to not act
[0:48:56] Unknown: from fear. And so I don't turn away in ways that I used to before, because of course, fear makes you
[0:49:01] Unknown: turn away. And if you have access to something larger, and you have more capacity, then you
[0:49:07] SPEAKER_01: don't need to turn away, and you can turn towards. So if we have more people doing that, we've got a
[0:49:12] SPEAKER_01: lot more healing going on. Maybe even though you wanted to end on capacity, maybe we could just
[0:49:17] Unknown: throw in a couple of words about ways one can interact with this, you know, and begin to soften
[0:49:24] Unknown: the sense of responsibility towards others. And I'm thinking like, other than, you know, of course,
[0:49:31] SPEAKER_01: I was doing therapy and talking about it, right, and all that kind of stuff. And then I remember
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_01: getting into a phase where I was doing like energetic cord cutting, which, you know, doesn't
[0:49:41] SPEAKER_01: really last as long as the belief systems are in place. But it is a beautiful symbolic metaphor,
[0:49:47] SPEAKER_01: you know, to begin to learn that practice and feel what it feels like, you know, to have those cords
[0:49:52] SPEAKER_01: cut and whatever. And then we get really curious about what are the belief systems that keep
[0:49:57] SPEAKER_01: reestablishing the cords, you know, and all of that. And that takes us down a road. And I do believe
[0:50:03] Unknown: that embodied meditation practices, such as the ones that Judith Blackstone offer, are really
[0:50:11] Unknown: lovely to learn self possession, right, so that we can start to delight in the beauty of our own
[0:50:19] SPEAKER_01: existence and feel how good it is and how right it is. And all of these different ways can start
[0:50:27] SPEAKER_01: to be supportive of one, breaking through the delusions that we have around us being responsible
[0:50:34] SPEAKER_01: for others well being, as in I have to do something or be something or say something
[0:50:42] Unknown: to make them better, right, it's a very particular flavor. So we can start to break up the delusions
[0:50:48] Unknown: around that, also begin to break up some of the energetic patterning we have around that, kind of
[0:50:56] SPEAKER_01: taking people into the system or going out to people into the ethos. And lastly, we can start
[0:51:05] SPEAKER_01: to find that inner place of grounding and rooting within us and know our own capacity and our own
[0:51:12] SPEAKER_01: resilience to start to let go of those cords, because sometimes our identities are our anchors,
[0:51:17] SPEAKER_01: right? They're like the way we're stabilizing ourselves. And so in order to let go of them,
[0:51:23] SPEAKER_01: sometimes we need to have that sense of a connection, like you were saying, like some
[0:51:27] Unknown: larger intelligence, and b connection to something within ourselves that can come to feel like home
[0:51:35] SPEAKER_01: and come to feel like root and come to feel like ground.

[0:52:26] Unknown: Here's one that made me cry from Steph Halligan. I've experienced so many face palm curse out loud
[0:52:33] SPEAKER_01: to myself moments while listening to Vanessa and Brooke. So many moments when I'm sitting alone
[0:52:38] SPEAKER_01: listening to the podcast and I let out a low audible groan because they've managed to describe
[0:52:42] Unknown: exactly what I've been experiencing. Moments when I'll have to stop and rewind a sentence
[0:52:47] SPEAKER_01: multiple times just so I can hear how they've managed to articulate this crazy,
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_01: seemingly undefinable journey. What a relief to know I'm not alone and what a privilege to be
[0:52:57] SPEAKER_01: able to witness these two women hash out their journeys in the open for all of us to hear.
[0:53:01] SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Thank you, Steph. And thank you, all of you for being on this path with us. We feel so
[0:53:08] SPEAKER_01: honored that this serves and that we're all here together figuring out how to be human beings.
[0:53:15] SPEAKER_01: We'll be back next week.
[0:53:38] Unknown: Thank you.
