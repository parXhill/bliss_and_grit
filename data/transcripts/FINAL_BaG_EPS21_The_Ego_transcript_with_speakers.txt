[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Skadu and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_00: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about
[0:00:17] SPEAKER_00: being on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is the
[0:00:22] SPEAKER_00: real evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy,
[0:00:28] SPEAKER_00: the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. We'll be attempting
[0:00:33] SPEAKER_00: to sort that out for ourselves here on the show. And we're just so glad you're listening
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_00: in. In this episode, we are literally on an ego trip. We're talking all about the ego.
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_00: What is it? Why do we have it? And how does it stand in our way? So many teachers argue
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: that the ego is kind of the primary structure that prevents us from knowing our true nature.
[0:00:56] SPEAKER_00: Are there benefits? And if we're born to know our own sacredness, why is it so hard to let
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: go of the ego stories and just come into the present? As usual, this conversation will
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_00: go on a journey covering psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, multiple spiritual traditions,
[0:01:16] Unknown: and of course, our own experience. If you're enjoying the show, we're always delighted
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_00: if you'd leave a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. You
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_00: can also head over to blissandgrit.com and subscribe to our mailing list to hear updates
[0:01:33] SPEAKER_00: on any upcoming events that we may have in the near future. One last note before we head
[0:01:38] SPEAKER_00: into the conversation. As many of you already know, Brooke and I do have potty mouths and
[0:01:44] SPEAKER_00: so if there are kiddos around, feel free to pop in some headphones now. Okay, here we go.
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so I think this is actually going to be a fun one, Brooke. I don't know why, but
[0:02:01] SPEAKER_00: I have a good feeling about it because maybe I'm into talking about the ego, which is what we're
[0:02:07] SPEAKER_00: going to dive into today. So I like this quote by Reggie that I may read in like different sections
[0:02:14] SPEAKER_00: as we go through the talk because it's a little bit dense. And I think we should just put the
[0:02:18] SPEAKER_00: quote somewhere in our resources or social media. But let me start off with the first line.
[0:02:24] SPEAKER_00: In the formation of our conscious self, our ego, quote unquote, in Buddhist terms,
[0:02:34] Unknown: we have walled off the great majority of what we have been, what we are, and what we can be.
[0:02:42] SPEAKER_00: So there's this way that Reggie's pointing to something that we also speak about in psychology,
[0:02:48] Unknown: actually, that we create this egoic self. We could also call it a persona. And sometimes in psychology
[0:02:59] Unknown: we'll use the term false self. And it's a constructed self. It may not be consciously
[0:03:07] SPEAKER_00: constructed at all of the time, although sometimes it is, like in the case of a sociopath,
[0:03:14] SPEAKER_00: they very, very clearly construct a conscious self. Or even someone may notice in their
[0:03:19] SPEAKER_00: adolescence that they really thought about who they want to be. But other times it's more
[0:03:24] Unknown: unconscious. It's more just created from ideas as we go through life and as we build these belief
[0:03:34] SPEAKER_00: and as we build these belief systems and narratives about what a good person would do,
[0:03:40] SPEAKER_00: what a functional person would do, what an admirable or successful person would do.
[0:03:46] SPEAKER_00: And essentially what we do is we constrict ways of being. We're ultimately in a process where we
[0:03:52] SPEAKER_00: say, this is not good. This is not worthwhile. This is not ideal. So we wall off those parts of
[0:04:01] Unknown: self or experience, as Reggie said. And then we say, and this is what a useful person would do,
[0:04:09] SPEAKER_00: a good person would do, a successful person would do. And we kind of amplify these traits.
[0:04:15] SPEAKER_00: And we can see this in neuroscience, Brooke, because what I learned about neuroscience is
[0:04:21] SPEAKER_00: that by the time you're eight years old, your brain starts to go through a process that they call
[0:04:28] SPEAKER_00: pruning, pruning. And what pruning is, is up until eight, your brain is just like
[0:04:36] SPEAKER_00: lit up with possibilities and pathways and like everything's ever learned, seen and experienced.
[0:04:43] Unknown: And as you become around the age of eight, your brain starts to prune off these pathways. It starts
[0:04:50] SPEAKER_00: to limit them. It starts to really, essentially, crazily enough, decide who it's going to be
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_00: and what life means and what life's going to be about. And it cuts off the pathways it thinks
[0:05:03] Unknown: are not a match. So it's like this crazy trip, if you look at that, because most of who we truly
[0:05:11] Unknown: decided we would be or we would believe was created by an eight year old's mind, you know,
[0:05:21] SPEAKER_00: an eight year old's functioning. Right? Isn't that crazy?
[0:05:24] SPEAKER_01: It's amazing. And it makes perfect sense.
[0:05:29] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's a trip because you go through your adult life thinking this is me,
[0:05:34] SPEAKER_00: you know, this is who I want to be. This is who I should be, right? Trying to live up to this
[0:05:38] SPEAKER_00: image. And then like slow down for a second and realize that those ideas were created by an
[0:05:45] SPEAKER_00: eight year old's mind. And you've been like holding true to them for so long.
[0:05:50] SPEAKER_01: And recreating them. Yeah. And just like constantly recreating them in order to
[0:05:55] SPEAKER_01: reinforce them. And I want to emphasize the point that you started with, although you just said a
[0:06:01] SPEAKER_01: mouthful, so we'll get into a lot of because there's so much good stuff in there. Mostly,
[0:06:09] SPEAKER_01: really like 99% of the time, this is unconscious. And we can bring it up to consciousness and then
[0:06:15] SPEAKER_01: see it from a different perspective. And sociopaths and adolescents are great examples of
[0:06:20] SPEAKER_01: conscious creation. But particularly by the time that we're adults, and like you said, these things
[0:06:26] SPEAKER_01: got, these tracks got laid down at age eight. They just are who we are. You know, it's like the
[0:06:32] SPEAKER_01: ultimate blind spot, right? Because who you are is just feels like you just feels like home. And if
[0:06:40] SPEAKER_01: there's not a practice of coming into stillness and coming into compassionate witness, and then
[0:06:48] Unknown: you just really are solidly ego identified. And it's never questioned, just is who you are.
[0:06:57] SPEAKER_01: And that's when we feel like, or we believe 100% without realizing that there's another option. We
[0:07:03] SPEAKER_01: believe that we are almost victims of our own lives and our own life circumstance. Like why does
[0:07:08] SPEAKER_01: this keep happening to me? You know, so we all have something, or many things in our life that keep
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_01: repeating, you know, we all have things that are harder karmic categories and easier karmic
[0:07:20] SPEAKER_01: categories, you know, so it's like, why am I always so unlucky in love? Why am I always
[0:07:25] SPEAKER_01: having such problems with money? Those are two of mine. Why am I so, you know,
[0:07:29] Unknown: these are things that you're more densely identified with your story of how it always goes for you.
[0:07:40] SPEAKER_01: So there's this wonderful opportunity in an understanding of the ego, which we'll be doing
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_01: more and more of today, because like you said, Vanessa, there's a lot of
[0:07:50] Unknown: density to this. And there's so much freedom in it. And for me, you know, ego, it's one of those
[0:08:01] SPEAKER_01: words, particularly when you identify as Buddhist dish, it's used a lot. And I really thought I had
[0:08:08] SPEAKER_01: an understanding of it for years. And it's this year that I'm starting to have an experiential
[0:08:15] SPEAKER_01: understanding of it, even though I've been doing this work for a very long time, and even doing
[0:08:19] SPEAKER_01: work like Byron Katie's work for many years, which really helps you to see your stories.
[0:08:25] Unknown: Add a layer right now where I'm really understanding experientially what the ego
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_01: actually is. And it's not a thing. It's not one thing. It's a million tiny little hooks
[0:08:39] SPEAKER_01: in a million tiny different little categories. And then there's layers and layers of veils
[0:08:43] SPEAKER_01: with each story in each category. And so we have the opportunity to have a less
[0:08:51] SPEAKER_01: fixed and less rigid, this is just who I am. This is just how it always goes for me relationship
[0:08:57] SPEAKER_01: to these things. And then all this fresh movement and experience in the form of what's happening
[0:09:05] SPEAKER_01: in your real actual life. Meaning not just epiphanies when you're on the cushion, which happened to
[0:09:11] SPEAKER_01: you, it starts to come through and you start to realize like, Oh my God, it was just this crazy
[0:09:21] Unknown: mind trip that I was on for, you know, only 30 whatever years I'm doing the math from when I was
[0:09:29] SPEAKER_01: eight 30 something years, where I just went along with the story, not because I'm a bad person,
[0:09:36] SPEAKER_01: or that's shameful, but just because it was just me. And I had this very fixed idea of meanness,
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_01: not just about myself, but about every me in the world. I'm gonna stop now.
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_01: There's like so many tributaries in this conversation that we could take, you know?
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_00: I know. Well, and even that the idea that we're in control, right, that this is me,
[0:10:02] SPEAKER_00: and that me thinks certain things and me knows certain things and me decides certain things as
[0:10:08] SPEAKER_00: if we there is a part of us that's deciding that and thinking that on purpose, we're choosing that
[0:10:13] SPEAKER_00: on purpose, you know, kind of highlights one aspect of the ego, which is this control mechanism.
[0:10:20] SPEAKER_00: So if you don't mind, Brooke, I think I'm going to read the rest of Reggie's quote, and we can,
[0:10:26] SPEAKER_00: you know, because we can really, I think, start to look at the architecture of the ego,
[0:10:32] SPEAKER_00: because you're describing like it has so much to it, these like million hooks. And so in a way,
[0:10:38] SPEAKER_00: there's like, what is the ego? And then in a way, there's like, how does the ego operate and
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_00: function? Like, how does it move within our system? And I think it could be useful to break that down.
[0:10:48] Unknown: So let me read part two of Reggie Ray's quote, which is, so there are three aspects to this
[0:10:55] SPEAKER_00: walling off, which we had described in the first part of the quote, the walling off of what we've
[0:11:01] SPEAKER_00: been, what we are and what we can be. Okay. There are three aspects to this walling off. First,
[0:11:08] SPEAKER_00: we have established a more or less limited field of awareness. Second, this limited awareness is
[0:11:17] SPEAKER_00: structured and defined by the particular concept or self image we have of ourselves. And finally,
[0:11:26] Unknown: it's maintained by the managerial aspect of the ego, whereby we act and react to whatever occurs
[0:11:35] SPEAKER_00: in our never ending efforts to establish, maintain, and secure our place in the world,
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_00: quote unquote. So let's just break that down again. So what Reggie is saying, and what Brooke and I
[0:11:51] SPEAKER_00: are saying for ourselves as well is the ego, the first thing it does is it limits the fields of
[0:11:58] SPEAKER_00: awareness. So, you know, if you think about emptiness from a Buddhist concept, we talk
[0:12:04] SPEAKER_00: about emptiness, emptiness, oftentimes you'll describe it as like no thingness, right? And
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_00: another way to look at emptiness is no thingness as in full of possibility, full of potentiality,
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_00: literally no limits, no identified or defined thing. So when we look at emptiness from that
[0:12:28] SPEAKER_00: perspective as full of potentiality, we can see that the first thing the ego does, an attempt to
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_00: create safety, because I guess Brooke, we should talk about why we create an ego. So let's come
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_00: back to that. But in an effort to create safety and a sense of control and predictability,
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_00: the first thing the ego does is it limits the field of awareness away from all potentiality into this,
[0:12:56] SPEAKER_00: this, I'm going to look at this. The second thing it does is the way that it selects like how to
[0:13:01] SPEAKER_00: limit the awareness is it goes, this makes sense to me, this is who I am, this is my self image,
[0:13:08] SPEAKER_00: and this is how the world fits into my self image. So I'm only going to see that. That's what the ego
[0:13:13] Unknown: does. It filters information through the lens of what it thinks reflects itself image and its sense
[0:13:21] SPEAKER_00: of what the world is. And then the last thing it does is it manages it all. And it basically like
[0:13:28] SPEAKER_00: screens what doesn't make sense. And then it establishes maintains and tries to essentially
[0:13:33] SPEAKER_00: manipulate reality so that its place in the world that it's defined as this makes sense,
[0:13:41] SPEAKER_00: continues on. Did I say that in a way that that resonates, Brooke?
[0:13:45] SPEAKER_01: Totally. So beautiful. So perfect. And I think it really starts to paint a picture of
[0:13:55] SPEAKER_01: the downside of ego and there are upsides of ego. I mean,
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_01: anyway, the downside of ego is that it it's limiting what we get to see in the world.
[0:14:07] SPEAKER_01: The upside of ego is that it's limiting what we get to see in the world. So
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_01: people who have fully awakened or enlightenment, all these words are so fucking tricky. But
[0:14:26] SPEAKER_01: there's this period of time, it's not just like, ooh, and now it's yummy times all the time,
[0:14:31] SPEAKER_01: particularly directly after awakening, a lot of people describe that there's quite a bit of
[0:14:39] Unknown: challenge in that because actually what goes away is this thing, your ego that's manipulating
[0:14:47] Unknown: what you see. So now you just see. So now there's no veils to protect you. Now what you realize also
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_01: when you awaken is that you're God, so you don't worry about protection in the way that you used
[0:15:00] SPEAKER_01: to worry about protection. You realize that everything's God. However, now suddenly, and
[0:15:07] SPEAKER_01: even for people who aren't considered awake, all of us who are on this path of coming into
[0:15:14] Unknown: deepening consciousness, let's call it, we come face to face, like as we pull these veils of the
[0:15:21] SPEAKER_01: ego away, we come face to face with parts of ourselves that we don't want to see and parts
[0:15:26] SPEAKER_01: of the world we don't want to see. We start to see the suffering of the world and maybe a much
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_01: more vulnerable and tender way, which has upsides and downsides because we want to meet that suffering
[0:15:36] SPEAKER_01: in a loving way as our hearts open. We see really a lot of the stories we told ourselves about
[0:15:44] Unknown: us and how we're the good guy, maybe not 100% true. We have to see
[0:15:49] Unknown: some of the harder aspects of ourselves as well. So, well, oh, sorry, go ahead,
[0:15:59] Unknown: Brooke. I was just going to actually toss the ball over to you and say,
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_01: probably talking about why we form an ego, which is in part just what the human brain does. Like
[0:16:10] SPEAKER_01: you said, this pruning process that starts at age eight, like it's something that just kicks into
[0:16:14] Unknown: gear. It's this evolutionary mechanism that we have, but how we develop it and it's so connected
[0:16:20] Unknown: to trying to feel safe in the world. Yeah, I just want to say before I forget that even
[0:16:29] SPEAKER_00: what you were just describing, we have to see aspects of ourselves that we may not like or
[0:16:33] SPEAKER_00: appreciate and we have to see aspects of life that may challenge us or be painful to see.
[0:16:39] SPEAKER_00: Not only that, but remember the episode we did on joy phobia. We have to see aspects of ourselves
[0:16:45] SPEAKER_00: that are great, aspects of ourselves that are beautiful, aspects of life that would blow our
[0:16:51] SPEAKER_00: hearts open. And as we've discussed in that episode, even that can feel threatening to people.
[0:16:58] SPEAKER_00: It's crazy because we think of the term ego and we think ego as in like puffed up, like you have so
[0:17:04] SPEAKER_00: much ego. That's not of course how we're using it, but it's funny that that got like
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_00: mashed up into our vernacular in that way. It's strange. Right. Like who are you to think that
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_00: about yourself? Now really though, what happens with the ego is it is literally just a constriction.
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_00: It's not to make yourself necessarily better or worse. Yeah. Yeah. It'll take whatever you decided
[0:17:29] SPEAKER_00: at some point unconsciously will make you safe. And really it's not even you decided. It's just
[0:17:35] Unknown: whatever was decided in your system that would make you safe in your environment, whether it was
[0:17:41] SPEAKER_00: to play big, play small, be tough, be cool, be vulnerable, whatever the case may be. It's
[0:17:49] Unknown: your system decided this is the way to play it. Yeah. And it causes a lot of suffering, obviously
[0:17:57] Unknown: that's the whole deal. But, you know, so for me, one of the ones that I'm really having to come
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_01: to terms with and let go of is the ego identity of I am the person who suffers. So it's like,
[0:18:10] SPEAKER_01: we can pick that we can form a whole identity around that. That's just one of my many hooks,
[0:18:15] SPEAKER_01: but it's this hook that you would think, well, I don't want that. Of course I want to let go of
[0:18:19] Unknown: that. No, actually there's so many perks to it. Right. So there are all these stories that hold
[0:18:26] SPEAKER_01: the different layers of ego in place. And those, you know, the story as the ego identity of I am
[0:18:31] SPEAKER_01: a person who suffers is that makes me the good one and the person who's victimizing me or persons,
[0:18:37] SPEAKER_01: the bad ones. It makes me the saintly one and the, you know, it makes me the one who can really lean
[0:18:43] SPEAKER_01: in because I just really am so good at like meeting the suffering circumstances. So it's fascinating.
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_01: Like we can create identity out of something really shitty that just keeps delivering us like,
[0:18:55] Unknown: okay, you want more of this? Okay. Here you go. You decided that this is you. Okay. Like you can
[0:19:02] SPEAKER_01: keep doing this or you can let go. And then you realize like, oh man, like the letting go
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_01: has its own grief tied up in it. And I think that for me anyway, and I don't know if I'm kind of
[0:19:18] SPEAKER_01: jumping too far ahead, but the thing that's been very, very useful for me is to realize that the
[0:19:25] SPEAKER_01: safety pins that hold the veils of ego in place are always stories. Like I was saying, you know,
[0:19:33] SPEAKER_01: this makes me good. And so you can start to, instead of thinking about taking the whole veil
[0:19:38] SPEAKER_01: away, like, oh, I'm just going to like let go of this whole identity I've had since I was probably
[0:19:42] Unknown: six years old that like I'm the victim, I'm the one who suffers. I can look at the safety pins.
[0:19:48] Unknown: It makes it more manageable. You know, it's like one little piece at a time, one little layer at
[0:19:53] Unknown: a time. And the safety pins are some story. Yeah. I mean, I would say, of course, like
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_00: one of the common ones a lot of us are stuck in, certainly, I think I got attached to was the
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_00: unworthiness story. Yeah, that's a big, you know, it's like for all of us, for so many of us, not
[0:20:11] Unknown: all of us. For so many of us, you know, it's just the trance of unworthiness and we're stuck in that
[0:20:16] SPEAKER_00: identity. And like, who would I be if I didn't think I was unworthy? Well, uh-oh, I don't know.
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_00: Would I be prideful? Would I accomplish things and then get attacked by people and like receive
[0:20:27] SPEAKER_00: criticism? Would I threaten the people I loved? Right. So there's so much, as you said, like
[0:20:32] SPEAKER_00: baked into what seems like unconscious perks of like why we keep the game going. I also have this
[0:20:38] SPEAKER_00: like, okay, I have this like, I don't know, secret theory that I'm not talking about a lot. But
[0:20:45] SPEAKER_00: um, I feel like, okay, so I'm so excited right now. I'm like, oh, secret theory we haven't talked
[0:20:52] Unknown: about yet. I might have built that up too much, but we'll see. No, um, Ron Duss has a great quote
[0:21:00] SPEAKER_00: I always loved. He says like, everybody you meet is God in drag. No doubt. Such a good one. He's so
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_00: good. So cool. Right. And like, okay, so with this theory, the crazy part is so are we, right?
[0:21:14] SPEAKER_00: That's obvious. We're God in drag, but we don't know consciously that we're in drag, right? That's
[0:21:21] SPEAKER_00: like all the, we've talked about this, the layers of clothing and the false self. Okay.
[0:21:26] SPEAKER_00: So then I'm thinking, but there is this aspect of self that knows, I mean, we can't lose truth.
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_00: Truth is always there. So there's an aspect of self that knows that we're God in drag. And like,
[0:21:39] Unknown: what if it's just having fun with its identity? Like, you know, what if it's playing, you know,
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_00: like the Hindus, I don't subscribe to Hinduism that often, but they talk about like Lila and
[0:21:51] Unknown: like life being a playground. And it's like, what if it's not only that we're attached to it,
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_00: because we're, we're afraid to let go of our ego, because we won't feel secure and life won't be
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_00: predictable. What if there's just a certain bit of us that's like enjoying the game, like
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_01: enjoying the role? Oh my God, I'm so in this right now. I'm, and I'm really experiencing this,
[0:22:15] Unknown: like as I let go of that, I'm the person who suffers identity, right? I'm like, oh my God,
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_01: none of it was a big deal. Yeah. Like, and I'm talking, and I'm going to say some upsetting
[0:22:28] SPEAKER_01: words now, but like abuse, assault, abandonment, like, you know, the stuff that is hard about
[0:22:37] SPEAKER_01: being a human. And as I let go of that identity, I'm like, oh my God, it was just playground time,
[0:22:43] SPEAKER_01: which isn't to say like I chose it or anything about shame or the getting off on terrible
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_01: circumstances. I would never wish it on anyone. And I wish it on myself. It's, it feels like
[0:22:55] SPEAKER_01: hell. It feels like living in hell. But as you get a little spaciousness from it, and I'm
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_01: really in the midst of this process, so I probably shouldn't talk about it too much,
[0:23:05] Unknown: but there's this experience of like, oh my God, none of it is a big deal. It's all okay. It's
[0:23:11] Unknown: just like you said, playground time. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. You know, I get that feeling for
[0:23:17] SPEAKER_00: myself too, but it's just like an itch. It's just like an itchy feeling as like some revelations are
[0:23:23] Unknown: coming into my system of like, huh, you know, there's like, you know, maybe I just want to try
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_00: this on for size this lifetime, you know, and I want to play with it. And if we're all source,
[0:23:34] Unknown: then source is doing this and it's doing it for some reason that may be beyond our conscious
[0:23:39] SPEAKER_00: understanding at this point, but it's trying things on for size. I mean, it's choosing the
[0:23:44] Unknown: form of an identity for some reason, because, you know, as you and I have talked about in earlier
[0:23:49] SPEAKER_00: episodes, I never sat down and was like, you know what I think I'm going to be? I think I'm going
[0:23:54] SPEAKER_00: to be a really insecure person who dives into suicidality a lot. That sounds super. That's what
[0:24:01] SPEAKER_00: I want. Yeah. That's just what got created, right? That's how my system moved. And you could say I'm
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_00: shaped by my environment, but other people in my environment were not shaped exactly the same way.
[0:24:13] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, it's just, that's when we start to look at source. That's when we start to understand
[0:24:18] SPEAKER_00: that even though we have this ego managerial control tower aspect of ourselves, there's
[0:24:24] Unknown: something else really moving us and animating us. Okay, so let's come back to the ego formation.
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_00: It is interesting. I mean, we can say it very succinctly and say that we form an ego because
[0:24:39] SPEAKER_00: the idea of a completely unpredictable, spontaneous reality feels like overwhelming
[0:24:46] SPEAKER_00: and scary as shit. And that the one thing we seem to crave as humans in this like wild existential
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_00: universe is something we can predict, something we can understand, because that can create safety,
[0:25:01] Unknown: like literal physical safety. And then of course, after that psychological safety. And I think,
[0:25:08] SPEAKER_00: you know, everyone listening to this podcast is already pretty smarty pants. And we're all pretty
[0:25:15] SPEAKER_00: geeky about these things. So we get that we can implicitly get that like, the ego is a managerial
[0:25:21] SPEAKER_00: system that was created in our human evolution, at least we can think from like a scientific
[0:25:28] Unknown: standpoint, to keep us safe. It uses information from the past to project into the future,
[0:25:37] SPEAKER_00: so that we don't repeat problems. And we can keep ourselves physically first and foremost,
[0:25:43] SPEAKER_00: physically safe. And then of course, this wonderful benefit of thinking we can keep
[0:25:48] SPEAKER_00: ourselves psychologically safe, which never ever pans out. No, or that it's going to keep
[0:25:53] Unknown: us from recreating problems when in fact, it completely relies on right perpetuating the
[0:25:59] SPEAKER_01: problems. We don't have our identity, which doesn't keep happening. We don't get to have
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_01: that identity. And if we don't have that identity, that's fucking scary. Yeah, yeah. And also, you
[0:26:08] SPEAKER_00: know, the ego is only really capable of since the ego is so bound up in this fear based survival
[0:26:14] SPEAKER_00: mode thinking, it's really only capable of working the way the survival brain works, which is to use
[0:26:20] Unknown: the past to predict the future. It's not our smartest part. No, it's not creative, and it's
[0:26:27] SPEAKER_00: not evolving. So it falls into what Sigmund Freud used to call the repetition compulsion.
[0:26:33] SPEAKER_00: It just repeats itself and repeats itself. And we think we're not, you know, like I think,
[0:26:39] SPEAKER_00: when I married my ex husband, he seemed to nothing like my father on paper at all. And then I totally
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_00: wound up feeling like I was walking on eggshells like I used to when I was a child with my father.
[0:26:51] SPEAKER_00: It's like, we think we're not but we totally are repeating things because we're all grabby hands
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_00: and like scaredy pants. And I like to call it clumsy hands. It's like, we're trying to be like,
[0:27:04] SPEAKER_00: not like we are, but we're so nervous that we're going to be like we think we're going to be that
[0:27:08] Unknown: we got like clumsy hands and we create it. Yeah. So anyway, you know, Reggie also would talk about
[0:27:14] SPEAKER_00: the anthropological development of the ego and how it's like, if we go really far back, and we're in
[0:27:20] SPEAKER_00: these tribal units and we're connected to nature and we're really into this like larger collective
[0:27:27] SPEAKER_00: consciousness, there was less need for the ego that over time, though, as the, you know, homo sapiens
[0:27:35] SPEAKER_00: are fighting off the neanderthals and different things, we had to start to develop this kind of
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_00: smart identity of separation so we can strategize and we could really defend ourselves against
[0:27:49] SPEAKER_00: these larger, more physically powerful opponents so that he thinks like anthropologically, that's
[0:27:56] SPEAKER_00: how the ego first started to form. And then, you know, over time, as we keep moving away from
[0:28:01] SPEAKER_00: tribal, we keep moving away from collective, we keep moving away from nature-based connectivity
[0:28:08] SPEAKER_00: and into the world of independence, that the ego has just taken a greater and greater foothold in
[0:28:15] Unknown: our system so that where historically it was really meant to be a tool, currently, it's become
[0:28:23] SPEAKER_01: our whole way of functioning. Yeah, our whole operating system and world view. Yeah, our whole
[0:28:27] SPEAKER_01: operating system. Of separateness, separate lumps everywhere. Yeah. And of course, in our cultures,
[0:28:33] SPEAKER_00: you know, and maybe for many of you listening, the more westernized you've gotten, the more we're
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_00: valuing independence, the more we're like using these ego identities to kind of move because we're
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_00: moving away from this sense that I'm actually not independent. You know, the ego in a way is a
[0:28:49] SPEAKER_00: complete figment. That's why we call it the false self. It makes me think that I, Vanessa Skado,
[0:28:56] Unknown: in this body, in this form, am choosing my destiny. I am separate and I'm mighty and I'm
[0:29:05] SPEAKER_00: creating all of my life choices. We get comfort in the idea of free will and choice and all
[0:29:13] SPEAKER_00: of these different things. And really, it's kind of counter to this idea that sources choosing and
[0:29:19] SPEAKER_00: that actually I'm a part of a whole, like my mirror neurons are mirroring Brooks and my environment
[0:29:25] SPEAKER_00: and I'm part of a collective unconscious and I have intergenerational trauma and that all of these
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_00: things are moving me. There's not just this static Vanessa, which is actually what neuroscience finds
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_00: is there is not a managerial self. We are actually a collective of multiple selves that step in and
[0:29:45] SPEAKER_00: like move things, never mind the fact that we are so interconnected with our environment. You
[0:29:51] SPEAKER_00: literally couldn't split hairs to know who is Vanessa and what is outside. Does that all make
[0:29:57] Unknown: sense? Absolutely. And I would like to say that this, we can play with this stuff in the realm
[0:30:05] SPEAKER_01: of the intellect and that's very helpful. So I'm not saying that that's not helpful.
[0:30:11] SPEAKER_01: And what we're going for, sorry about the honking horn outside if anyone can hear it. I'm at my
[0:30:15] Unknown: office today. New Haven is such a quiet place. What we're going towards, what we're moving towards
[0:30:23] SPEAKER_01: is a felt sense experience of this. And I think this is where Judith Blackstone's work becomes,
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_01: so many people's, but because you and I are training with Judith, it becomes so helpful
[0:30:34] SPEAKER_01: because these concepts are really just concepts until we get a glimpse of an experience of it.
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: For me, I had what was for sure the most profound except for when I was seven, which I won't go into
[0:30:47] SPEAKER_01: all that, but other than when I was seven, the most profound realization when I was meditating
[0:30:53] Unknown: on retreat, just like a good cliche would have it. And I could see myself from inside my body and all
[0:31:01] SPEAKER_01: I could see were my arms raising and lowering. So there wasn't anything interesting to see. It was
[0:31:06] SPEAKER_01: just my arms raising and lowering. And I realized it was like, oh my God, it wasn't me raising and
[0:31:12] Unknown: moving my arms, me, Brooke, the ego identity. I realized, and what the words were that came was,
[0:31:18] Unknown: oh my God. And it was hilarious to me. Oh my God, I'm not a person. And then the other phrase was,
[0:31:26] SPEAKER_01: I've never done anything in my whole life. And it felt like the most hilarious and most liberating
[0:31:36] SPEAKER_01: thing in the world that I had ever thought I was a person and that I had ever done anything. It was
[0:31:40] Unknown: just this glimpse that it's just God moving me. And that glimpse has not stayed. You know, I'm not
[0:31:48] Unknown: an awakened person, but it's informed and informing what unfolds. And so having some kind of
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_01: embodied experience. And that's where these somatic practices are so gorgeous because it's
[0:32:03] Unknown: the only thing that like trips the wire of your intellect and your ego identity wanting to show
[0:32:11] SPEAKER_01: you everything and make it all whatever it wants to make it for you. You know, and it can talk
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_01: about it, it can seem really smart. And it's like, well, hey, if I understand, if I understand
[0:32:18] SPEAKER_01: intellectually that we're all God, then what's the deal? I'm enlightened. It's like, no, no, no, no.
[0:32:23] SPEAKER_01: We can understand that intellectually all day long doesn't mean jack shit unless we know that
[0:32:27] Unknown: we're operating from that place. So maybe we want to talk about Judas work of that a little bit.
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_00: What do you think? Yeah. And just to add to what you're saying, I think there's a certain amount
[0:32:41] SPEAKER_00: that can be done through inquiry as well. Yeah. Like, you know, kind of the whole zhuzh of psychology
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_00: is to make the unconscious conscious so that what you can't see doesn't keep ruling you. And
[0:32:55] SPEAKER_00: there's a certain amount that through inquiry, whether it's spiritual inquiry, like a lot of
[0:32:59] SPEAKER_00: teachers will use inquiry, like Lucille Francis is just really an inquiry based kind of practitioner,
[0:33:06] Unknown: a lot of really great ones, you know, or through things like psychology or Byron Katie's work,
[0:33:11] Unknown: whatever it is, you use these processes of inquiry. And it's like you start to have these
[0:33:17] SPEAKER_00: epiphanies like, oh, I'm not that I'm not that. And that's the moment. Right. Is the like, oh,
[0:33:23] SPEAKER_01: you know, that inquiry gets you to the same place of like, oh my God, you just have this moment of
[0:33:28] SPEAKER_00: the soap bubble popping. Yeah. So let me let me introduce the concept of the false self. And then
[0:33:35] Unknown: we'll go into Judas a little bit. So, you know, in psychology, we use this term, the false self,
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_00: you'll see it through, like Winnicott and, and many, many psychoanalysts, actually, even.
[0:33:47] SPEAKER_00: So basically, it's your persona, it's this identity, right? Like I am this, I am not that.
[0:33:52] SPEAKER_00: And it's this tunnel vision for who you can be. Now, the problem with the false self is it can be
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_00: very successful in our world, actually, right, you can create a wonderful persona that people really
[0:34:06] SPEAKER_00: applaud, or, or you could be the foil, and you could be the worst. And, you know, everyone can
[0:34:11] Unknown: feel sympathy for you, whatever the case may be. But no matter what, it's still false. And you know
[0:34:19] Unknown: it. And that is one of the biggest, I think, dilemmas that we have. We feel sometimes unreal,
[0:34:32] Unknown: we can feel empty, we can feel like we're faking it, we can worry that if they only found out,
[0:34:38] Unknown: like if they only knew us, they'd really find out who we were. I had that. These to me, I've
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_00: come to see all as hallmarks of a false self operating, and not living from your internal
[0:34:53] SPEAKER_00: truth and your internal alignment. Maybe better to say, not living from a place of interconnectivity,
[0:35:00] Unknown: right. So we have these false selves. I had one, for sure. I still have some. It's like it dissolves
[0:35:08] Unknown: over time in greater and greater increments. And we move from there. And then we feel like empty or
[0:35:16] SPEAKER_00: ungrounded or dissatisfied or like we're not being true or like something's missing. We have all these
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_00: different experiences. So we think, well, you know what I'll do? I'll just build up my false self more.
[0:35:27] SPEAKER_00: If only I was even better. If only I spoke even better. If only I had a better boyfriend. If only
[0:35:31] SPEAKER_00: I had a better job. We just keep working at the level of where the problem is. Right there.
[0:35:39] SPEAKER_00: Out there. And it's really just us trying to make an even better false self because we don't
[0:35:45] SPEAKER_00: understand that that was the root of us feeling like something is empty. So then what's the antidote?
[0:35:52] Unknown: So, you know, in Taoism, they talk about a concept of suchness, like the uniqueness that is
[0:36:00] SPEAKER_00: brook, the suchness. It's not a contrived state. It's just who, if I let down every bit of my guard,
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_00: every bit of my I should, every bit of I have to, it's who I would be. Actually, Alan Watts tells
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_00: this great story. It's from Nietzsche. It's actually like a parable from Nietzsche, but
[0:36:23] SPEAKER_00: Nietzsche talks about how like at first in life, everybody's like a camel. And the camel is like,
[0:36:31] SPEAKER_00: like pile it on my back world. I can handle this burden. I'm so strong. Like whatever you've got,
[0:36:38] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to like load up on me. That's the first stage of which we meet the world. Then
[0:36:45] SPEAKER_00: the camel like becomes a lion and the lion in this desert sees this dragon and the dragon is covered
[0:36:53] SPEAKER_00: in these plaques on it that each time it says thou shalt like you should all over the dragon.
[0:37:00] SPEAKER_00: And if you slay the dragon of I should, you actually become a baby. And then the world is
[0:37:07] SPEAKER_00: yours again. And it's full of potentiality. Right. And I just thought like, that's it. We're all
[0:37:13] SPEAKER_00: facing up against this part of ourselves, this ego managing system that says it should,
[0:37:18] Unknown: you should, they should. Right. And to free yourself from that, the Taoists would say would
[0:37:24] Unknown: be to move spontaneously. And they would call it self so like self hyphen. So, and to be self so
[0:37:34] SPEAKER_00: is to just move how you move, move how you fucking move. You can't even predict it. You don't know
[0:37:39] SPEAKER_00: how you move. Reggie talks a lot about this and I've experienced this with clients. It's where I'm
[0:37:44] SPEAKER_00: the most self so it's like very little Vanessa, very much just like, I don't know what's going
[0:37:48] Unknown: to come through in this co-created moment. You know, so really the goal in this, like if we were
[0:37:56] SPEAKER_00: to like say it out loud is to become self so as to become spontaneous. It's the exact opposite of
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_00: how can I create a better self? Right. And you and I talk about fix it. So let me read a little
[0:38:09] Unknown: bit of what Judith would say. She says, the false self is bound up in our mind, energy and body.
[0:38:21] Unknown: It does not go away when it is denied. The rigid distortions of the false self become over time,
[0:38:28] SPEAKER_00: static patterns of tension in the body that literally trap us in their limiting patterns,
[0:38:36] Unknown: their densities in the tissue of our body. These densities obscure our realization of fundamental
[0:38:45] SPEAKER_00: consciousness. They block our access to the vertical core of our body and they obstruct our
[0:38:52] Unknown: spontaneous, direct experience of life. They keep us reacting to the world as we reacted
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_00: out of what was then necessity in our family of origin. So chew on that Brooke Thomas.
[0:39:09] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'll chew on that. Oh boy. No, I just think, I mean, it's one of the reasons why I'm so
[0:39:16] SPEAKER_01: drawn to people like, we keep calling him Reggie by the way, for those of you who are new to the
[0:39:20] SPEAKER_01: show, Reggie Ray, who we consider to be one of our primary teachers. Get with it. Reggie Ray.
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_01: And Judith Blackstone is because for me as a body person, and everyone's going to have their
[0:39:34] SPEAKER_01: different best way in, but for me that has been tremendously useful because then I get to have
[0:39:40] SPEAKER_01: these felt experiences. So for example, with Judith, she has that meditation,
[0:39:49] SPEAKER_01: she takes you through where you get very, very, very deeply embodied to a degree that you didn't
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: know was possible, which, you know, I've been in this field and working on my own body healing
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_01: for about 20 years. So, you know, I've had a lot of embodiment work, but you get deep, deep, deep
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_01: in there. And then you have the experience that your body and the space of the room, of the world,
[0:40:16] Unknown: of the other people around you are continuous. Now, when you actually get to feel that,
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: it's one of these glorious, and you used the word ecstatic, which was perfect, almost ecstatic
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_01: feelings of not being bound by the rigid false self and like, oh my God, I'm not, I'm not what
[0:40:42] Unknown: I have thought I was. I'm not this individual person with this storyline, and also I am,
[0:40:53] SPEAKER_01: you know, like you said, nothing's ever going to be one way in this realm, folks, so that's how
[0:40:58] SPEAKER_01: that goes. But like you said, you know, if we remove all of the false self stories and beliefs
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_01: and operating systems, what's left is something that actually is fundamentally
[0:41:14] Unknown: you, the truest flavor of you that gets kind of channeled through in this really flow
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_01: of source, flow of truth, beautiful way. Yeah, I mean, I think that what we're talking about,
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_00: like what Judith identified and Reggie says all the time, and you and I are talking about is that
[0:41:39] Unknown: we talked about this in the karma episode, is that it's hard for us to have a direct experience
[0:41:45] Unknown: of life. There's a threat in that, or at least there's a threat to our ego in that. And so we
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_00: resist it, right? And this is just one way that we resist it by creating an identity, right? But
[0:41:59] SPEAKER_00: then ultimately, it's blocking this deep sense of connection to ourself and connection to our
[0:42:04] SPEAKER_00: world, which is what we really want. We have this innate drive for wholeness, right? So
[0:42:13] SPEAKER_00: by doing these different kinds of practice, whether it's inquiry and or meditation,
[0:42:18] SPEAKER_00: or going within or whatever you do, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, it's it's they're all different roads
[0:42:24] Unknown: to recognize truth, which is the realization of what you really are, which is a deep, deep sense
[0:42:31] Unknown: of connection, right? So the important thing to kind of remember, I guess, is twofolds is that
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_00: as I've done this for myself, as I've done these practices, as I've kind of popped some of these
[0:42:45] Unknown: soap bubbles of my narratives, I feel more and more real, whole, true, myself at one. It's not
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_00: that I don't have these neurotic thoughts sometimes, and I don't have storylines, I definitely,
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_00: definitely do. I still move from fear at different moments. You all know that, because I talk about
[0:43:08] Unknown: it. But like we've said in other episodes before, I feel whole, I feel present, I don't feel ever
[0:43:17] Unknown: like I'm faking something or something's missing, or something's wrong, or somehow things are empty
[0:43:22] SPEAKER_00: ever, ever anymore. And I think that's the joy of it all. That's why it's worth going through the
[0:43:30] SPEAKER_00: direct experience and sitting with observing the managerial aspects of the ego, which is
[0:43:36] SPEAKER_00: really crazy to see how we manipulate our environment. Really crazy.
[0:43:40] SPEAKER_01: And our whole fucking view of everything.
[0:43:44] SPEAKER_00: God, and like, we do things to people, even you people who are good people out there,
[0:43:48] SPEAKER_00: you know you're a good person, I'm a good person. Like we manipulate people with how we language
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_00: stuff, with what we say, with what we don't say, with what we do.
[0:43:55] SPEAKER_01: The good person and their identity is one of the most harmful.
[0:43:58] SPEAKER_00: Oh, God, we do crazy stuff.
[0:44:01] SPEAKER_01: Talk about wolf in sheep's clothing. And that's, I mean, me, like I'm one of those people.
[0:44:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you're definitely not the most harmful. It's just the sneakiest.
[0:44:10] SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, but like it's the sneakiest.
[0:44:11] SPEAKER_00: It's very sneaky. It's very sneaky.
[0:44:14] SPEAKER_00: And that's really- Sneaky to the person doing it and sneaky
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_01: to the people receiving it. So it's sneaky all around.
[0:44:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, very sneaky. There's a lot of Houdini about the good person, because it's like,
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_00: how could you judge me? I'm such a good person.
[0:44:25] SPEAKER_01: I know what's best. Just do what I want you to do so I can puppeteer the whole world.
[0:44:32] SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So it's a very sneaky one. But like, do remember this. It's like part of what this
[0:44:38] Unknown: Judith quote was getting at is that, you know, by the time we form these ego identities,
[0:44:45] SPEAKER_00: by the time we're eight and then like we move through life with it for 20, 30, 40 years,
[0:44:50] Unknown: however old you are, there are tensions in our body. It changes the way we move.
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_00: It changes the way we breathe. Literally.
[0:45:00] SPEAKER_00: Literally. And this goes back really, and even in the psychoanalytic world,
[0:45:05] SPEAKER_00: Wilhelm Reich was talking about this years ago. Alexander Lowen. Oh my God.
[0:45:11] SPEAKER_00: If you want to read about psychology and the body, read Alexander Lowen. Never mind.
[0:45:17] SPEAKER_00: Buddha was saying it. And that these great modern day teachers are talking about it.
[0:45:22] SPEAKER_00: And Zen was talking about it. This is like, you can find this sprinkled throughout this idea. So
[0:45:28] SPEAKER_00: it like gets stored in our body. So not only do we have a certain way of thinking when the ego is
[0:45:34] SPEAKER_00: managing and therefore a certain way of driving our choices, but it also impacts how much we can
[0:45:40] SPEAKER_00: move or not move, how we like walk, how we speak, you know, how we breathe, how we stand.
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_00: And that's why this all then starts to get mirrored into our reality. And then what our ego decides
[0:45:54] Unknown: is real becomes real. Cause it's flavoring everything. Yeah. I'd kind of like to end with a
[0:46:02] SPEAKER_01: great story. I just heard Muji tell, I was watching a video of a satsang with him and I just feel like
[0:46:08] SPEAKER_01: it's kind of illustrating what we're talking about in a hilarious way. So he had somebody at
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_01: satsang means that people come together with a spiritual teacher and they're able to say,
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_01: ask questions or talk about what's going on in their own lives. And then, you know,
[0:46:22] SPEAKER_01: spontaneously the teacher responds to those things in a way that helps them to see with more clarity.
[0:46:28] SPEAKER_01: So this man was asking Muji, so sincere, you know, you could tell he was very identified in a very
[0:46:37] SPEAKER_01: suffering kind of way. Like everything irritated him. Like people snore and people talk too loud,
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_01: people chew their food, you know, like that, one of those kinds of personalities.
[0:46:45] SPEAKER_01: And he said to Muji, he's, and he, he had enough self-awareness to say this. He said, I kind of
[0:46:49] Unknown: feel like a child in a children's story who's saying, I want to Muji basically deliver
[0:46:58] SPEAKER_01: enlightenment to me. I want my ice cream cone and I want you to give it to me now.
[0:47:03] SPEAKER_01: And I don't want to wait. I want the ice cream cone now. And Muji said, well, okay,
[0:47:08] SPEAKER_01: it's all happening right now. So I'm over here and I'm holding your ice cream cone.
[0:47:13] Unknown: You can have your ice cream cone. It's right here. And he said, did you come over to me
[0:47:18] SPEAKER_01: and you're holding a ball, a children's toy, a ball. And you say, and I say, well, you have
[0:47:24] SPEAKER_01: to put down the ball or else you won't be able to pick up the ice cream cone. And he said, no,
[0:47:27] Unknown: I don't want to put down the ball. Well, it doesn't work like that.
[0:47:32] SPEAKER_01: You're going to have to put down the ball. And he says, well, that ice cream cone is very small.
[0:47:36] SPEAKER_01: The ice cream cone on the poster over there, it's very big and it's beautiful and it looks amazing.
[0:47:43] SPEAKER_01: And it has four scoops and this one only has two scoops. I want it to look like the one
[0:47:46] Unknown: on the poster. And he says, well, that one doesn't exist. That's just the poster. This is the ice
[0:47:52] SPEAKER_01: cream cone. It's right here. I'm offering it to you. Put down the ball, put down the ball.
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_01: And so that's obviously our ego. And I think that it's just, it's such a funny and beautiful
[0:48:03] SPEAKER_01: and useful story. And it's helpful just to think about throughout the day, what is the ball that I
[0:48:09] Unknown: don't want to put down right now? Cause I want my ball and I want my ice cream cone, but I'm not
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_01: willing to put down the ball to get the ice cream cone. Oh, and PSC ice cream cone should look like
[0:48:17] Unknown: what I want it to look like and not what it actually looks like. Oh girl. Now I'm so excited
[0:48:22] SPEAKER_00: you ended with this story. First of all, it's beautiful. It's a great illustration. And second
[0:48:26] Unknown: of all, it sets us up to talk about the poster. Yeah. Let's talk about the poster next time.
[0:48:32] SPEAKER_00: Except we say that all the time and then we're, we don't follow through. We're going to do it
