[0:00:24] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:35] SPEAKER_01: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about being on the
[0:00:42] SPEAKER_01: embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is a real evolution of our
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_01: lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes,
[0:00:55] SPEAKER_01: the bliss and the grit that is a human life. In last week's episode, we touched on the benefits
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_01: of bringing mindful attention to your thoughts and patterns. This week, inspired by a quote from a
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_01: teacher named Gangaji, we're taking the conversation deeper with an exploration of the importance of
[0:01:17] SPEAKER_01: vigilance. If you've been listening to us for a while, you know we're usually speaking about how
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_01: hypervigilance can create tensions and feed fears of unworthiness. Yet, we also want to stay alert
[0:01:30] SPEAKER_01: to ways in which our unconscious programs are running. Moreover, we're served in bringing our
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_01: attention towards our innate wholeness. So in this episode, we're kicking around the concept of sacred
[0:01:46] Unknown: vigil and the deep power of our attention. If you're enjoying the show, we're always so delighted
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_01: when you leave a review on iTunes or our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. And thanks to all
[0:02:00] SPEAKER_01: of you who've done that already. You can also head over to blissandgrit.com to subscribe to get our
[0:02:06] SPEAKER_01: weekly digest or to become a supporting member of our Patreon page. One last thing before we head
[0:02:14] SPEAKER_01: into conversation, just in case you're new, sometimes Brooke and I do curse. So if you're in
[0:02:21] SPEAKER_01: mixed non-swearing company, you may want to wear headphones. Okay, everyone, here we go.
[0:02:27] Unknown: Hi Brooke. Hi Vanessa. So for all of you who've been listening to the show, you may have noticed
[0:02:40] Unknown: that oftentimes Brooke and I are speaking about how you don't really want to be hyper vigilant
[0:02:48] Unknown: with yourself, hyper vigilant with the world. And that comes from psychology in a way, it comes from
[0:02:57] SPEAKER_01: understanding of trauma and how a nervous system and a body and a mind can develop hyper vigilance
[0:03:03] Unknown: based on things in the past. And since so many of us are suffering with the wound of thinking we're
[0:03:10] SPEAKER_01: not enough and becoming hyper vigilant with ourselves or suffering of the wounds that the
[0:03:16] SPEAKER_01: world is a terrible place where people are really harmful and being hyper vigilant of them. It's
[0:03:22] Unknown: really good medicine to allow yourself to soften and relax and to give yourself permission not to
[0:03:31] SPEAKER_01: follow every single thing with that level of high alert. And so it was really interesting for me when
[0:03:40] SPEAKER_01: I just read a paragraph about vigilance and why you needed it. And it struck me as interesting
[0:03:47] SPEAKER_01: right away. So I thought it'd be fun for me to read this little section from the book Ordinary
[0:03:55] SPEAKER_01: Women, Extraordinary Wisdom, to give maybe a new conversation around vigilance and what that is
[0:04:04] Unknown: and how it may be in service of us. Sound good? Sounds so good. Okay, so in this book,
[0:04:10] SPEAKER_01: which I highly recommend, it's such a joy for me to read, what she does is she interviews different
[0:04:16] SPEAKER_01: teachers. And so this little excerpt that I'm reading is coming from an interview with a
[0:04:22] Unknown: teacher named Gangaji. And so here we go. Okay. So Gangaji says, finally, there was a profound
[0:04:32] Unknown: relaxation and a willingness to discover the true meaning of vigilance. Vigilance is not a
[0:04:41] SPEAKER_01: super egoic task, an idea that I shouldn't be feeling this or thinking that, or that I should
[0:04:48] SPEAKER_01: constantly be watching my thought. True vigilance is a much deeper level of recognizing yourself
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_01: as pure awareness. I heard Papaji, that's her teacher for any of you listening,
[0:05:04] Unknown: I heard Papaji say that vigilance is required until your last breath. To me, vigilance is a
[0:05:14] Unknown: holy word. It is to keep vigil as the light of awareness. In the past, I had interpreted
[0:05:22] SPEAKER_01: vigilance as a kind of burden, like putting a lid on it or making myself be a certain way.
[0:05:28] Unknown: Vigilance is soft, open. In another sense, it's simply telling the truth.
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_01: There's a point where it's important to tell your story so that you can see where it's going.
[0:05:40] Unknown: Then you can begin to question, am I indulging this? Have I told this story too many times?
[0:05:47] Unknown: For me, it was an experience of internalizing Papaji, of giving myself satsang. If there was
[0:05:54] Unknown: going to be an internal dialogue, it was going to be a dialogue of opening and seeing what is true,
[0:06:01] SPEAKER_01: not the dialogue of collusion with fixation or suffering. Instead, my intention, my attention
[0:06:08] Unknown: turned towards the true inquiry. Who am I? What am I doing right now? If there is no inner dialogue,
[0:06:17] SPEAKER_01: then nothing is needed because there's nothing but spacious emptiness. If you are involved in
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_01: your stories and an inner dialogue appears, it is useful to tell the truth about the quality
[0:06:29] Unknown: of that dialogue. This is true vigilance. Not as something sanctimonious or preachy,
[0:06:35] Unknown: definitely not. If it is preachy, there will be a rebellion against it. Vigilance is simply an
[0:06:42] Unknown: opening, a loving welcome into truth. That really struck me when I read it for some reason,
[0:06:50] Unknown: all sorts of underlines and page marks and everything. I love because language is so
[0:07:00] SPEAKER_01: unhelpful sometimes. I love when it gets challenged and sort of turned on its head.
[0:07:06] SPEAKER_01: It kind of pressures us into taking a much more fine, subtle approach
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_01: to what this internal experience is that arises around our stories and our thoughts.
[0:07:22] SPEAKER_01: So what do you think? You have some thoughts on that?
[0:07:26] SPEAKER_00: This has been actually really up for me since my private session with Hamoda Ma,
[0:07:32] SPEAKER_00: which I talked about some in the last episode. So I'll do my best to not repeat myself,
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_00: but no promises because I remember nothing that I ever say in an episode.
[0:07:42] SPEAKER_00: You're all like, we covered this territory literally last episode. I apologize.
[0:07:51] SPEAKER_00: This realization of what a true vigilance with the self is and the way she's describing it,
[0:07:58] Unknown: Gangaji is describing it as this very loving attention. I love the way she describes it as
[0:08:06] Unknown: giving yourself satsang. So I've been noticing lately and in my session with Hamoda, it was
[0:08:14] SPEAKER_00: very helpful assistance in this. It's like developing a new sense organ. What the sense
[0:08:22] Unknown: organ does is allows awareness to have a conversation with itself, which is really
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_00: different than the mind having a conversation with itself, which we're all really familiar with.
[0:08:40] SPEAKER_00: As that is changing, this new sense organ is developing where I can have... So vigilance,
[0:08:49] SPEAKER_00: that word is, it can be made like you're talking about hypervigilance, hyper aroused,
[0:08:55] Unknown: but it can also just be aware to attend. As that's developing this funny old habit
[0:09:06] SPEAKER_00: that I've had my entire life is falling away and becoming meaningless, but it's comedic to
[0:09:12] SPEAKER_00: watch it happen. So the old habit, maybe some of you all have this too, or I'm just admitting
[0:09:16] Unknown: something totally as an embarrassing personal quirk. I'm a talk to myself person out loud.
[0:09:24] SPEAKER_00: So if I'm alone in my house or driving in my car and only if there's something that's like
[0:09:30] SPEAKER_00: mentally pressurized, like I need to make a decision or I'm stressed out about something
[0:09:34] SPEAKER_00: or whatever, I will talk to myself out loud about it in kind of a like pro and con list, like, okay,
[0:09:42] SPEAKER_00: all right. On the one hand, actually it's so funny, my ex-husband who's still a good friend of mine,
[0:09:46] SPEAKER_00: he still makes fun of me that when we were married, I used to always be like, okay,
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_00: if something comes up, we need to sit down and have a talk and not necessarily about he and I,
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_00: but like about a decision thing, like are we going to move or what about this way that I would be
[0:10:03] SPEAKER_00: like, okay, but it has to be sitting down and talking. And I do that with myself too, where
[0:10:10] SPEAKER_00: it's like, okay, on the one hand, I could, and because move is on my mind, I could stay in my
[0:10:15] SPEAKER_00: current house and here's the plan and blah, blah, blah, or on the other hand, I could call so and
[0:10:19] SPEAKER_00: so. And so it's like this very mental strategic bullet point pros, cons, weigh it out. And I did
[0:10:29] SPEAKER_00: that for my whole life because it felt useful. It felt helpful. It felt like a way to make a decision.
[0:10:36] SPEAKER_00: And so nowadays, if I attempt to do that, which is like a phantom limb pain, so it's this old
[0:10:44] SPEAKER_00: habit and it'll come up to do it, right? I'll be driving in my car and I'll be wondering about,
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_00: you know, should I try and move? And I'll start saying words out loud to myself. And it just very
[0:10:56] SPEAKER_00: quickly turns to like, like, there's just nothing to say. And it's hilarious because I realized that
[0:11:02] SPEAKER_00: I'm getting nowhere. Like, it seems like lots of bells and whistles and because I'm talking and
[0:11:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm weighing options that something really must be happening, but nothing is happening. It's really
[0:11:13] SPEAKER_00: exactly like a dog chasing its tail. At least for me, this has been what I've discovered.
[0:11:18] SPEAKER_00: On the other hand, the skill or the sense organ that's developing is a much
[0:11:25] SPEAKER_00: closer intimacy with my own awareness about what goes on. So I had spoken in the last episode about
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_00: in my session with Amoda that there, I'll have these very large, very unpleasant emotional
[0:11:42] Unknown: sensations and a way of not being vigilant, a way that I went with that was kind of the like, it's just
[0:11:52] SPEAKER_00: doing its thing. And like, sometimes things suck and it's unpleasant. And so here we are. And like
[0:12:00] Unknown: kind of that just moving towards acceptance as if that's the virtuous thing. Like I'll just, you know,
[0:12:07] SPEAKER_00: be here with this awful sensation until it-
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_00: Even if it's forever.
[0:12:12] Unknown: Even if it's forever. But what I'm discovering and what that session helped me see a lot is that
[0:12:19] SPEAKER_00: there's actually a way that we don't have to be stuck in accepting hell, that we can be
[0:12:29] Unknown: vigilant and really attentive to in this case. So what exactly
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_00: came up mentally? What exactly was I believing or thinking? What thought was triggered before
[0:12:48] SPEAKER_00: the sensation came? And something that was very helpful that Amoda pointed out for me is that
[0:12:54] Unknown: there's always a thought that triggers this kind of suffering emotion. And I had really felt like,
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_00: oh, some of these things are just in my body and they're coming out and that's also true. So it's
[0:13:12] SPEAKER_00: not that that's not true. That is also true. But in order to suffer less or to let the wave move
[0:13:19] SPEAKER_00: through more quickly, instead of just kind of, I'll soften around this awful sensation and just
[0:13:24] Unknown: accept that that's what it is, that I can be vigilant and I can really go and look. And so
[0:13:31] SPEAKER_00: instead of popping up into the head and like, okay, what might it have been and pondering and
[0:13:37] Unknown: let's see what are some options? It requires going into the being, going into awareness with
[0:13:46] SPEAKER_00: a really fine subtlety, going into being, I mean, as opposed to going into mental story or pro and
[0:13:54] SPEAKER_00: con lists and seeing can I, and this is such a, I mean, I had no idea the layers of subtlety,
[0:14:02] SPEAKER_00: of discernment that I had to go and see in the example I gave in the last episode, although of
[0:14:07] Unknown: course there are many others was I forgot to buy cheese at the grocery store. But then the thought
[0:14:13] Unknown: cascade is about I did something wrong and, and then realizing, oh, these, these floods of sensation
[0:14:20] Unknown: always come up with a thought about how I screwed up and how I've done something wrong. And my
[0:14:27] Unknown: experience in the week since having that session, so it's, it's new, but as I can discern more and
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_00: more and really instead of it, the habit is to turn away and just give into suffering and hope
[0:14:43] Unknown: it'll go away and know that it'll go away eventually. The skill is to turn towards vigilance
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_00: and to really say, okay, I don't have to lay around in hell. I can turn towards in a very
[0:14:58] SPEAKER_00: loving and soft and affectionate way and see, can I discern that fine, fine layer? Was there a thought
[0:15:07] SPEAKER_00: not, um, there's some quote who said this quote, when you're watching your mind
[0:15:14] SPEAKER_00: and behave more like a birdwatcher and less like a dog trainer.
[0:15:20] Unknown: Oh yeah, you sent that to me. I can't remember who's quote that is.
[0:15:22] SPEAKER_01: I want to say it was like Antonio DiMasio, but I might be misquoting that.
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_00: I think you Anthony DiMello.
[0:15:29] Unknown: There you go. C-A-D-O.
[0:15:30] Unknown: Hey, so close. Um, so it's like that. It's like being a birdwatcher. It's like, or watching the,
[0:15:38] Unknown: the weather. Um, there's no, you don't have any investment, like those birds had better behave
[0:15:46] Unknown: the way that a dog trainer has an investment. And, and wow, like I have had a really different
[0:15:54] SPEAKER_00: experience of myself because of this very tender vigilance. So I'm so glad you discovered that
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_00: Gankaji writing at the same time that I'm like, I feel like I'm really in it with developing this.
[0:16:11] SPEAKER_01: Can you share so, I mean, obviously I relate to you and I had a lot of different things to say,
[0:16:18] Unknown: but I am curious. So as you watch like a birdwatcher, which is a skill actually.
[0:16:26] SPEAKER_00: It's a huge skill. I mean, it's a skill I've been working on very keenly as my primary
[0:16:33] SPEAKER_00: thing for, you know, intensely for the last two years. Yeah. It's a practice. So it's like
[0:16:38] SPEAKER_01: mindfulness training. Like we can train our attention. This is like a practice to be able
[0:16:43] SPEAKER_01: to observe with neutrality, with softness, with openness, without judgment, without having to make
[0:16:50] Unknown: something good or bad or categorizing, right? Okay. So as you observe and bring your attention
[0:16:59] Unknown: towards, is there a thought when you've been able to identify there is a thought,
[0:17:07] Unknown: then what do you do? Then what happens? Well, in this case, like what I'm talking about in the
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_00: past week. And like, as we're, as you were talking and going to ask me a question,
[0:17:23] SPEAKER_00: I started to feel just a little bit, not much, just a little bit of a wave of nausea. So it's
[0:17:28] SPEAKER_00: like so great, right? Because it's happening in the moment. So instead of before, and a part of
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_00: it is the white noise problem, which I also talked about in the last episode, like it's just familiar
[0:17:39] SPEAKER_00: to feel kind of crappy all the time. So whatever, it doesn't get my attention, right? But now it
[0:17:43] Unknown: gets my attention. So just a little bit of nausea. And I turn towards, so like you said, the practiced
[0:17:51] SPEAKER_00: skill of awareness, what's the nausea? And I realized I'm having, there was this thought,
[0:17:56] Unknown: I hope I can articulate this in a way where I get it right, and am helpful. So suddenly this
[0:18:09] Unknown: attachment comes in, I'd better be able to seem smart or seem like I can explain it, and I had
[0:18:16] SPEAKER_00: better be able to help people. Right? And then in this case, and in the case of what I've been doing
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_00: the last week, just seeing it actually makes the sensation go away. But when it's something that's
[0:18:30] Unknown: gnarlier, and I can't, it won't unhook. And in my work with my clients, what I find is really
[0:18:37] SPEAKER_00: John Prendergast's work, where you go to your being, again, learn skill, and you can sit in your
[0:18:45] SPEAKER_00: heart, and you can have this dialogue, and you can ask. So if it's just the way that he teaches
[0:18:51] SPEAKER_00: his work, at least in my experience of it, but I think he says this in our combo with him too.
[0:18:57] SPEAKER_00: If it's just an emotion, like a raw emotion, you don't know what the belief is, you can ask,
[0:19:04] Unknown: you can inquire what is at the core of this. And when you know there's a belief system,
[0:19:11] Unknown: like for example, I hope I get this right. With the belief system, you can ask, what is your
[0:19:21] SPEAKER_00: deepest knowing of this? And the you is your being, your awareness. What is your deepest knowing of
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_00: this? And then the thing is, is that the mind has the habit of like, oh, oh, I can figure it out.
[0:19:36] SPEAKER_00: Let me figure it out. And so we have to learn how to discern when it's the mind talking,
[0:19:41] SPEAKER_00: when it's the being talking, and the being, it will often deliver something in a flash,
[0:19:46] SPEAKER_00: like a little lightning bolt moment, instead of like laboring, like you're making a mental list.
[0:19:52] SPEAKER_00: And it'll also often come in a more experiential way than a mental linear way. So it'll be like,
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_00: maybe a visual, a vision or something like that.
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_01: I think I'm finally starting to develop a deeper appreciation for inquiry. So it's not that I never
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_01: asked questions, let's say by Rinkady style of asking questions, is this true? Is this definitely
[0:20:20] SPEAKER_01: true? It's not that I've never done that kind of level of questioning the truth of your beliefs
[0:20:26] Unknown: or your thoughts as they've arisen. But this kind of inquiry that Adyashanti talks about,
[0:20:33] SPEAKER_01: or Dorothy Hunt talks about, or so many teachers talk about that's like, who is it that's having
[0:20:40] Unknown: the thought? I was never prone to that. That always seems so far away. So like, I don't know,
[0:20:51] SPEAKER_01: uber spiritual, like, oh, who is it that's having the thought? There's not even an I here.
[0:20:56] SPEAKER_01: There's an easy way to be that spiritual person with that inquiry. Sure.
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_01: I don't know, just never, never arose to be relatable for me. And perhaps I wasn't ready for
[0:21:07] SPEAKER_01: for it. But it is interesting is I'm at this particular place that I'm at, whatever that is,
[0:21:14] Unknown: where I found that to be really relieving. Maybe some things let go, you know, earlier
[0:21:21] Unknown: in my own trajectory, especially being so fascinated by psychology, but I think,
[0:21:28] Unknown: primarily just being human, we are so interested in our stories, like really interested by them,
[0:21:34] SPEAKER_01: like, oh, so this happened. And then that happened. And then that's why I'm like this. And you know,
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_01: this probably means that I'm such and such or people are such and such. And, you know, we, I
[0:21:50] Unknown: love that process. I still love that process. You know, it's fun. It's interesting. It's fascinating.
[0:21:57] Unknown: It's so I think when you would notice, even when I would notice with some level of vigilance,
[0:22:07] SPEAKER_01: oh, that thought's not totally true. That's really interesting. Like the time I told you,
[0:22:12] SPEAKER_01: Brooke, and I can't remember if I said it last episode, but I'm walking down the street
[0:22:17] SPEAKER_01: in San Francisco, feeling elated for zero reason, in particular, just elated, though.
[0:22:24] SPEAKER_01: And I had a thought buzz in and the thought said, What are you so happy about? We're all
[0:22:29] Unknown: going to die anyway. Right. And thinking about death is a particular button for me. So this
[0:22:37] Unknown: thought knew me very well, like it arose to meet me in particular. And and I was able to see it,
[0:22:45] Unknown: I had a moment of clear seeing that so fascinating. Here comes this thought, ready to dash everything
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_01: on the rocks, right. But I had a clear seeing so I didn't go down into some kind of a patterned
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_01: hold with it. Like typically that thought comes and then another one comes. Yeah, that is so sad.
[0:23:03] SPEAKER_01: I wonder when I'm going to die. My parents are getting older. I think they're going to die.
[0:23:07] SPEAKER_01: Can I handle it? You know, typically, that's how a thought structure like it can start to build its
[0:23:12] SPEAKER_01: own architecture of pain. But I think in the past, I would have been prone to even go so what does it
[0:23:20] Unknown: mean that I thought this? Like, what does it mean about solid me about Vanessa as an individual,
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_01: as this concretization, Italian girl from this past with her parents grew up in, you know,
[0:23:36] Unknown: Queens. And now I'm finding a looseness. It's more like, sometimes all I'm able to do is mark
[0:23:46] SPEAKER_01: a moment like last week, after Brooke and I were recording. I don't know why we were talking about
[0:23:54] SPEAKER_01: the nervous system, which I'm super duper curious about. And I've had some really profound
[0:23:59] Unknown: experiences in my life. But somehow, in the episode, when I started to talk about it,
[0:24:06] Unknown: I could sense something different happened, something uncomfortable, it was energetic in me,
[0:24:13] SPEAKER_01: I couldn't tell after. Was I not speaking from experience? Is that why I was getting like a
[0:24:20] Unknown: nudge or an awareness? Was it effortful, because I'm speaking from the level of intellect as opposed
[0:24:29] Unknown: to from the level of being? And I still don't know. But I could flag like that's so interesting,
[0:24:36] SPEAKER_01: something felt different. And in the aftermath of something felt feeling different, then I did
[0:24:42] SPEAKER_01: start to have some of those thoughts like, Am I doing something wrong? Did I do something wrong,
[0:24:46] Unknown: like little shame based narratives floating through the system. And I don't know what it means. And I
[0:24:56] SPEAKER_01: couldn't follow the thought much deeper, I didn't have the level of vigilance to say, Who am I? And
[0:25:03] SPEAKER_01: who is the I that I think did something bad? I couldn't inquire at that level. But sometimes
[0:25:08] SPEAKER_01: I think vigilance is just, Oh, that's interesting. It won't go much farther than that. That's so
[0:25:13] Unknown: interesting. This being is doing that thing. Huh. And maybe if I catch it 10 times, something will
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_01: begin to appear to me like, Oh, my God, this always happens. When my I want to be smart agendas
[0:25:29] Unknown: running. That's the feeling tone. Oh, okay. Right. So maybe sometimes vigilance is just this certain
[0:25:37] Unknown: attention to a contraction, a shift, a way of speaking a tone of voice that alerts you
[0:25:47] Unknown: that something doesn't quite feel I don't know, is alignment a good word? Let's say it is in alignment.
[0:25:56] SPEAKER_01: And recently, on top of it, in the last couple of days being literally recently, I have started to
[0:26:02] SPEAKER_01: appreciate a more direct inquiry, no meaning, no personalization, no life history, just
[0:26:09] SPEAKER_01: who is it that feels shame, for example, and who would I be ashamed of?
[0:26:16] Unknown: And that really, I think, well, a that just blows my mind, it like literally blows my mind,
[0:26:24] SPEAKER_01: like the circuit busts, right? So then that is a tremendous relief. But I possibly the reason why
[0:26:32] SPEAKER_01: it wasn't right for me to do that earlier is you can see how quick that's a bypass, right?
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_01: Well, there is no one in there thinking this thought or having this feeling. And that wasn't
[0:26:42] SPEAKER_01: a path for me. The path was first to acknowledge that there was shame, there was fear, there was
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_01: pain, there was grief, there was contraction, there was narrative, there were unhealthy belief
[0:26:51] Unknown: systems like, and now perhaps it's feeling very medicinal to say, Yeah, and nothing is solid the
[0:27:00] Unknown: way you think. Yeah, and I think that when we're more densely identified, which all of us
[0:27:10] SPEAKER_00: are, that's a phase of the human journey, or the entire human journey for many, many lifetimes,
[0:27:15] Unknown: who knows, if you believe in lifetimes, that to do that kind of inquiry can also just very quickly,
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_00: if you're really that close to yourself, if you really feel like a you, then it can be very harmful
[0:27:33] SPEAKER_00: because it's like, you go into all the what is wrong with you? Why are you like this? Why can't
[0:27:39] SPEAKER_00: you stop having shame based thoughts? And it goes into this hammering away at yourself kind of
[0:27:48] SPEAKER_00: quality. So it's like you have that or you have the bypass of like, Oh, yeah, nothing really is
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_00: happening here. So there's a maturation or, or I guess, I don't know, just an experience of as you
[0:28:05] SPEAKER_00: loosen the soil of you, you know, as you have a little bit of distance from I really am this
[0:28:11] SPEAKER_00: person, my story really means x, y, z, you know, that I've told for my whole life, I am my
[0:28:19] Unknown: conditioning, my conditioning is real, then this just isn't the right tool isn't ripe for use,
[0:28:30] SPEAKER_00: is no utility. But once you're there, you know, it's very fast, it's actually really potent,
[0:28:38] Unknown: it's very quick tool, which is so tremendously relieving. Although there are some teachers
[0:28:46] Unknown: interesting, we'll have lock Kelly on in a bit. And he's a big inquiry guy, you know, from hearing
[0:28:54] SPEAKER_00: him on other interviews. And I liked his book very much. Like, I think he just gets right to
[0:29:00] SPEAKER_01: it with inquiry by Rinkati. Same thing. Most most teachers do get right to it with inquiry.
[0:29:05] Unknown: Adi Ashanti gets right to it with inquiry. I think they don't think it's premature. For me,
[0:29:11] SPEAKER_01: who knows why anything has happened to me. I mean, all of it is just making something up at
[0:29:16] Unknown: this point. I just think I think the danger of bypass danger sounds so loaded. I think the
[0:29:26] Unknown: commonality of moving into a bypass is is so ubiquitous that and I was it was so common for
[0:29:35] SPEAKER_01: me to move into bypass. I was like, Oh, I'll just be the happy person because I have a good happy
[0:29:41] SPEAKER_01: temperament. So it's just la la la. But then as soon as like I hit a bump, it was like depths of
[0:29:48] SPEAKER_01: despair. It wasn't actually just a happy person. Right. So more integration was available as I
[0:29:56] SPEAKER_01: turned towards feelings towards my story towards making sense towards forgiveness of others towards
[0:30:01] Unknown: forgiveness of self and, and all of these things that are really in service. When when you do think
[0:30:09] SPEAKER_01: you have a solid self when you are a solid self, as far as you can tell, when there is no difference,
[0:30:14] SPEAKER_01: you are an individual, super helpful and gave me more and more freedom in that plane.
[0:30:21] SPEAKER_01: But the teachers who teach inquiry, they get right in because they don't,
[0:30:26] SPEAKER_01: they seem to not feel that anyone has to think of themselves as a self at all, like that there is no
[0:30:33] Unknown: utility in that. And what is interesting to me about it, though, is so let's say someone does
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: have an awakening without ever having thought of themselves as a solid self without ever having
[0:30:45] SPEAKER_01: made sense of their life story without ever having sat with the painful, gunky emotions that are in
[0:30:50] SPEAKER_01: their body. Well, then they have to do it after anyway. Right. You know, so it's like, I don't
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_01: know, since awakening is not at all in your control. And that's what everyone's always pointing us
[0:31:01] SPEAKER_01: towards. And it's grace and it's karma or whatever it is, something inexplicable.
[0:31:08] Unknown: What we can look at is how can I meet myself more fully? How can I be with my pain? How can I soften
[0:31:17] Unknown: towards myself and others? How can I be love? How can I experience my wholeness? So I think that's
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_01: where my journey mostly led. And now it's just something new is happening where I'm like, oh,
[0:31:32] SPEAKER_01: there might have been something to that inquiry thing that all those teachers that I really respect
[0:31:36] Unknown: keep repeatedly pointing towards. Right, right. I'm thinking about my son and I are currently
[0:31:43] Unknown: obsessed with the cartoon Adventure Time. So forgive me for bringing in a cartoon reference,
[0:31:48] Unknown: but you know how I roll Vanessa? Oh, I'm thinking I have to watch it now. Oh, it's so funny.
[0:31:54] SPEAKER_00: Um, but anyway, there's this evil but not really evil ice king. And at some point, the two heroes
[0:32:02] SPEAKER_00: of the story are saying something to him along the lines of like, I can't believe you do that. And he
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_00: says, he says, you don't understand if you were me, you would do the kinds of things that I do.
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_00: I was like, that's basically the story of humanity. Like as long as we're all
[0:32:21] SPEAKER_00: believing that we are who we think we are, we're going to just act out in the reflexive ways based
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_00: on our conditioning. So it's like the evils of the world. And the evils are real evils, right? Like,
[0:32:34] SPEAKER_00: racism, misogyny, abuse, all these horrible things. Like, these people are acting these things out
[0:32:41] Unknown: because they're believing certain things that come from their thoughts about who they are,
[0:32:48] SPEAKER_00: what the world is, what they need, what their agenda is, and they inflict harm.
[0:32:55] SPEAKER_00: You don't understand if you were me, you would do the kinds of things that I do.
[0:33:03] Unknown: You know, so just by way of like, why would we even care about having a conversation that
[0:33:12] SPEAKER_00: really brings attention to vigilance? Like, freeing the world, healing the ills is an inside job. We
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_00: all get to untether ourselves from acting out our conditioning, even if we're not the ones, right?
[0:33:27] SPEAKER_00: And like, we all carry all these histories and lineages inside of us too, or we've, you know,
[0:33:32] SPEAKER_00: had our moments, right? So also for believing the thought that like, but we're the one, we're the
[0:33:37] SPEAKER_00: one that doesn't have any of the ways, the negative ways of acting out. Like, I'm guarantee you're
[0:33:41] SPEAKER_00: going to find them. So it's actually like remarkably healing to be able to
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_00: cultivate this kind of relationship with yourself. And I think that the only
[0:33:52] SPEAKER_00: ingredient that's required, like you were saying, like it's not required that you have awakened.
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_00: It's not required that you consider yourself to be on a spiritual path
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_00: or any of these things. The only thing that is required is willingness. And the thing that
[0:34:09] SPEAKER_00: usually brings willingness to our front door is acute suffering. And I think it's awesome when
[0:34:14] SPEAKER_00: that's not how it arrives. And I think that there's a lot of possibility for the human species that we
[0:34:20] SPEAKER_00: can have this arrive more and more without needing that kind of pressurized suffering. But it does
[0:34:24] SPEAKER_00: seem that that's for a lot of us the way that it arrives. And so if willingness has arrived in our
[0:34:30] Unknown: life, like I'm really willing, I'm really willing to inquire and to see what are the things that I'm
[0:34:37] SPEAKER_00: believing are true? What are the stories that I'm acting out over and over and over again in my life
[0:34:43] Unknown: and on the world and on the people in my world? And that's how things really change in the out there
[0:34:52] Unknown: world. I would say willingness, courage always comes up as one for me. And also, God, it's super,
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_01: helpful to have some measure of compassion and tenderness. Otherwise, that's why we caution
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_01: against hypervigilance so much is because we know our own journeys. And we talk to so many people
[0:35:16] SPEAKER_01: that we know how often when we're watching ourselves, we're watching ourselves in order
[0:35:21] SPEAKER_01: to be like, I knew it. I knew you sucked. I knew you were the worst. Or we're like watching the
[0:35:26] SPEAKER_01: world in order to be like, I knew people are terrible human beings. Usually, we're watching
[0:35:34] SPEAKER_01: in order to prove something right, like to prove a belief system right. And it's like super cranky
[0:35:40] SPEAKER_01: and painful. And that's maybe just what happens is we begin to be able to see more. Maybe we all just
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_01: go through that phase. You know that moment when you could see something about yourself you hadn't
[0:35:52] SPEAKER_01: seen like maybe the first time or second time third time you begin to go Oh, I'm like that.
[0:36:00] SPEAKER_01: Like, Oh, I'm really anxious and relationship and I was super needy and I completely objectified my
[0:36:06] SPEAKER_01: ex husband. This is true. This is what I discovered after I got divorced. Like, Oh,
[0:36:14] Unknown: you know, in the beginning, when I'd have that kind of revelation, there was this like, Oh, I suck.
[0:36:22] Unknown: Right? Like I had to sit with discomfort and anxiety and shame and guilt. And, you know,
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_01: over the years, it's it's more like when she said satsang and you highlighted that brook.
[0:36:36] SPEAKER_01: It's lovely because I know how to be loving after all of these years of being with myself
[0:36:41] SPEAKER_01: and having the honor of sitting with other humans while they're suffering and being able to be
[0:36:47] SPEAKER_01: non-judgmental with that. I have the muscles that I can go Oh, isn't that interesting?
[0:36:53] SPEAKER_01: This aliveness does this and this aliveness does that way more readily. But I think that that can
[0:37:00] Unknown: go along with willingness to maybe it ups the willingness so that we're not so afraid to see
[0:37:08] SPEAKER_01: the patterns so that we don't kind of try to occlude them. So we don't have to have those
[0:37:13] Unknown: feelings. But I want to shift the conversation slightly. And if you have something to say about
[0:37:22] SPEAKER_01: what I say, just say it anyway, but before our time's up, because I think there's another aspect
[0:37:28] Unknown: of vigilance that could be brought in. So there's this open loving observance of how our belief
[0:37:35] Unknown: systems and conditionings are activated, of how we tell ourselves stories, and we make meaning out
[0:37:42] Unknown: of things. Of how the world is mirroring some of our fears, etc, etc. But there's also something
[0:37:51] SPEAKER_01: else. See what you think about this, Brooke. I think in part vigilance could also be spoken about
[0:37:58] SPEAKER_01: in terms of observing, I think Gangaji pointed to this, but I can't remember her words, your wholeness.
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_01: So let's say, for example, when we talk about John Prendergast's work, and one of the beautiful
[0:38:11] SPEAKER_01: things that John pointed us all towards that I have seen and experienced is make contact with
[0:38:19] SPEAKER_01: the part of yourself that's already whole, right, the part of yourself that knows the part of yourself
[0:38:24] Unknown: that's connected. And when people do this exercise, when I walk clients through it, always they find it,
[0:38:32] Unknown: always, always. So there might be a part that's holding a fear that has a thought that has a
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_01: feeling, but there's a part that knows it's already whole, that already is connected.
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_01: So what I want to offer forward is that another aspect of holding vigil may be holding in your
[0:38:52] Unknown: awareness the aspects of you that are already whole. The moments of realization, the moments of
[0:39:00] Unknown: peace, the moments of joy, the moments of pure love, the moments of bliss, so that if you imagine
[0:39:08] SPEAKER_01: I have never heard a teacher say that thought stops just because you've seen the truth of reality,
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_01: and none of them have ever said conditioning stops just because you've seen the truth of reality.
[0:39:20] SPEAKER_01: Certainly not in my experience, not that I've seen all the truth, but for all the truth I've now seen,
[0:39:25] SPEAKER_01: still goes on. So if thought's always going to go through this body-mind, and some measure of
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_01: conditioning may go through this body-mind, or projection, or whatnot, then that's an aspect
[0:39:36] Unknown: of this human experience. But even in the same moment as that's happening, there's another aspect
[0:39:44] Unknown: of awareness that we could bring attention towards, the part that's whole, joyful, connected,
[0:39:50] Unknown: loving, already present, already accepting. And I wonder if some of vigilance is holding vigil
[0:40:00] Unknown: towards that part that is in existence as well, as opposed to that common habit we have to think
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_01: our thoughts are something to pay close attention to. Yeah, and I'm thinking of Judith Blackstone's
[0:40:18] SPEAKER_00: work, the realization process work, and she always, I mean she has a core practice that proceeds,
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_00: you know, doing any work, at least in our training, the attunement to fundamental
[0:40:29] Unknown: consciousness, that you first attune to the fundamental consciousness in you and in the world,
[0:40:38] Unknown: and that you can have that contact before you start noticing something in the individual,
[0:40:47] SPEAKER_00: you know, having awareness inside of yourself of like, oh, I have this pattern, for example.
[0:40:52] Unknown: And we have such a disector culture, you know, where we're always looking, because we believe
[0:41:00] SPEAKER_00: that we're separate selves, made of separate parts, in a world of other separate selves,
[0:41:05] Unknown: and everything is a separate, apart thing. Our whole culture is coded around pulling out the
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_00: scalpel and looking to dissect whatever. We do it with everything. And so we do it with our
[0:41:18] Unknown: thoughts, so that the word vigilance doesn't mean what you're describing, like this holding
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_00: this open space, contacting the part of yourself that's already whole, and then having this tender,
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_00: loving, affectionate inquiry. We think automatically, and why wouldn't we, when it's
[0:41:40] SPEAKER_00: what we see everywhere, that it means pulling out the scalpel and cutting out the bad stuff,
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_00: you know, and that that's what vigilance is. And of course, that doesn't feel good, it feels
[0:41:50] Unknown: terrible. So I think that's a super useful and very important piece to bring in is that we do
[0:41:58] SPEAKER_00: want to contact our wholeness. And same thing with me with my clients, like,
[0:42:04] SPEAKER_00: I haven't encountered anyone who's not able to make contact with that. And I think there's
[0:42:08] Unknown: something really special in having a relationship with a person who can sort of walk you in and
[0:42:15] Unknown: hold space and demonstrate and be there, that that kind of dedicated time in a dyad is so
[0:42:25] SPEAKER_00: powerful, because we need to be trained to feel the wholeness, or we need to be reminded, we need
[0:42:34] Unknown: to be walked over that direction, so that the sense organ, you know, for it can develop or
[0:42:43] SPEAKER_00: wake up, that it can come out of its slumber and go, Oh, yeah, oh, this, this thing that I'm,
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_00: that I'm touching here.
[0:42:51] SPEAKER_01: I know. What I think is so interesting is we just did an episode on spiritual bypass.
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_01: And we spoke about it with the Moda. And all of these things do have nuances, because it is
[0:43:03] Unknown: different medicine for different people at different moments. So what I think is interesting is we can
[0:43:09] SPEAKER_01: be so vigilant against spiritual bypass, that in a certain way, we can imagine that our stories
[0:43:16] SPEAKER_01: and our narratives and always turning towards the pain that is evoked by those belief systems
[0:43:24] SPEAKER_01: is the non bypass route, right? We talked about this a little bit last week. But I'm imagining,
[0:43:30] SPEAKER_01: you know, there comes a moment when you can start to recognize, like in any given moment,
[0:43:37] SPEAKER_01: there's gratitude present, and maybe I can search for a little pocket of pain.
[0:43:42] Unknown: And which one does my attention go towards? Or there's the power of now there's presence,
[0:43:49] Unknown: there's stillness. And maybe there's the little pocket of pain. And which one do I go towards?
[0:43:55] SPEAKER_01: And depending on our karmic patterning, you know, we can be so ingrained to go towards the pockets
[0:44:01] SPEAKER_01: of pain. Or we can come to believe that's the right thing to do the spiritual thing to do the
[0:44:07] SPEAKER_01: healthy thing to do that we don't hold the same vigil, like we're always holding vigil for pain,
[0:44:14] Unknown: as opposed to holding vigil for direct experience. Yeah. Like actual direct experience.
[0:44:23] Unknown: I was thinking when I was hiking this morning, and all of this was kind of circulating around
[0:44:28] SPEAKER_01: my mind. And I was thinking about how hard it is even to talk about some of these things sometimes,
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_01: and how it must be interesting for spiritual teachers like a Moda and Karen and John and all
[0:44:41] Unknown: these people out there to put into words, their experiences, and especially talk about things like
[0:44:48] SPEAKER_01: awakening, because like some at some points, like who cares, and, and you can't have it as a goal.
[0:44:54] SPEAKER_01: So like, why are we talking about it, because then it makes it a goal, even if we don't want
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_01: it to be a goal, you know, and I was thinking about all this. And I was like, Eckhart totally
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_01: had it right, man, just talk about the power of now. Because it's, you know, right here,
[0:45:07] SPEAKER_01: it's easily accessible, no matter what you're conditioning, or what you're karmic patterning,
[0:45:14] Unknown: we can all be here now. And then I was thinking, like, even that, like, what does it mean to be
[0:45:20] Unknown: present? Really? Like, really, what does it mean to be present? Because I could imagine that there's
[0:45:28] SPEAKER_01: a moment where we think following our storyline and really analyzing it and dissecting it is
[0:45:35] Unknown: being present. Exactly. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But that's in the past, like that literally is not
[0:45:42] SPEAKER_01: happening anymore. It really literally isn't. So is that being present? Or is being present being
[0:45:48] SPEAKER_01: in my body and taking a breath? And if there's a contraction staying with that, but if there's not,
[0:45:54] Unknown: what am I being present with if I'm following, you know, a dialogue along in my mind? So I even
[0:46:01] Unknown: think that's an interesting. Yeah. A handful of years ago. Like, I well, I read the power of now
[0:46:10] SPEAKER_00: when it first came out. And I remember thinking like a lot of people like, well, of course, I'm
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_00: here now. And then I read the book and I was like, oh, OK, I can be more on it about being here now.
[0:46:22] Unknown: Yeah. Goals. Goals. Step one. Be here now. Check box. I love when you snort. And then I remember
[0:46:33] SPEAKER_00: sort of visually and mentally tagging the world. So if I go on a hiking trail, this was actually
[0:46:40] Unknown: given to me as a technique, which for the record, I think is terrible. But I would go like hiking
[0:46:46] SPEAKER_00: and I'd be like tree leaf sneakers, wind on my face, white trail marker leaf sun bird sound,
[0:46:57] SPEAKER_00: bird sound. Like, and I would mentally try and pull the world into my brain and tag it to be there
[0:47:04] SPEAKER_00: now. Right. Not being there now. That's not having an experience. It's erecting constantly
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_00: erecting barriers between you and your experience by turning it into a concept. And then you it's
[0:47:19] SPEAKER_00: always what you're basically doing is this just happened. This just happened. This just happened.
[0:47:23] SPEAKER_00: This just happened. So you're in the past. You never get to be in the actual unfolding moment.
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_01: So I had a good or when will this happen? This just happened. When will this happen?
[0:47:34] SPEAKER_00: Right. Or and then of course, like you automatically label it wind on my face.
[0:47:38] SPEAKER_00: Oh, the wind on my face feels good. I'm a good person for liking the feeling of the wind on my face.
[0:47:42] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's just it's so easy. Right. Those people who aren't having this awesome meditative.
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_00: Meditative. I like this experience experience.
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_01: We're so funny. Mercy, mercy, mercy to the humans because we're hilarious.
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_01: I know it's like, just to I have to go read the book again, The Power of Now, I think,
[0:48:11] SPEAKER_01: sitting where I am now and and like have a different experience because I'm thinking,
[0:48:16] SPEAKER_01: gosh, you know, I had this as a question to ask a motive, but I couldn't seem to formulate it
[0:48:20] Unknown: into words like, what does it mean to you to be present? I'm just curious what she would say,
[0:48:27] Unknown: because remember when we were in Judith's workshop and she was talking about with she had a woman up
[0:48:34] SPEAKER_01: in front of the class and they were having a session together and she was talking about being
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_01: present in her eyes and clearing the past out of her eyes because the woman was somehow projecting
[0:48:45] SPEAKER_01: the past into the present moment literally in her eyes. And when you were watching,
[0:48:52] SPEAKER_00: you could see it. Yes, you can see the past go and see her arrive in the room.
[0:48:58] SPEAKER_01: We wouldn't have seen it unless Judith pointed to it. I wouldn't have seen it.
[0:49:02] Unknown: Other people might have. But but as soon as she did, it was clear as day. It was as clear as I
[0:49:08] SPEAKER_01: have, you know, a hangnail on my finger, like no question about it. So even being present has its
[0:49:17] Unknown: own fucking complex nuances. But I think it's just such an interesting thing, because maybe in a way,
[0:49:25] SPEAKER_01: this whole vigilance is that it's being present with the sacred unfolding of a liveness that is
[0:49:34] SPEAKER_01: taking place here.
