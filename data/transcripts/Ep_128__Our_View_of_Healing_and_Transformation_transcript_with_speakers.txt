[0:00:32] SPEAKER_01: You're listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:34] SPEAKER_01: I'm Brooke Thomas, and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa
[0:00:37] Unknown: Skado.
[0:00:39] SPEAKER_01: On the show, we're having conversations about the awakening spiritual path.
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_01: And what does that even mean?
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_01: What's a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_01: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:49] SPEAKER_01: The beauty and the crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human
[0:00:53] Unknown: life.
[0:00:55] SPEAKER_01: Before we head into the episode, just a brief note that after this episode, we're about
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_01: to head into a six-week summer break.
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_01: We will be airing reruns of shows that struck us as particularly potent during that time.
[0:01:07] SPEAKER_01: So there will be episodes.
[0:01:08] SPEAKER_01: They'll just be not new ones.
[0:01:10] SPEAKER_01: And then we'll be back at the end of the summer.
[0:01:14] SPEAKER_01: And for this episode, we recorded while we were gathered together at the Jersey Shore
[0:01:19] Unknown: for a full week devoted to Bliss and Grit.
[0:01:22] Unknown: And for those of you who are new to the show, Vanessa lives in Austin, I live in Connecticut,
[0:01:27] Unknown: and our work weeks are filled with seeing clients and we produce the show on the side.
[0:01:31] SPEAKER_01: So this was a rare treat, both to be in the same place and also to be able to focus so
[0:01:36] SPEAKER_01: singularly on the future of Bliss and Grit.
[0:01:40] Unknown: And because that was the whole focus of the week, for this episode, we zoomed out and
[0:01:45] SPEAKER_01: we explored, well, what is Bliss and Grit about exactly?
[0:01:48] Unknown: And more specifically, after nearly three years, 127 episodes and lots of personal healing,
[0:01:56] Unknown: inquiry, and exposure to different teachers and practices, what is our working model of
[0:02:01] SPEAKER_01: healing and of transformation?
[0:02:04] SPEAKER_01: So our big questions typically are things that are most especially, how does conditioning
[0:02:10] SPEAKER_01: store in us?
[0:02:12] SPEAKER_01: And how do we untangle that?
[0:02:15] SPEAKER_01: And very importantly, if we are not our conditioning, well, what are we?
[0:02:20] SPEAKER_01: And this is an ongoing lived inquiry, really more than a nailed down blueprint.
[0:02:25] SPEAKER_01: And it's more about building bridges between systems that are evocative of human potential
[0:02:29] SPEAKER_01: rather than of picking a team and declaring it the winner.
[0:02:32] SPEAKER_01: So that's where we're at.
[0:02:35] Unknown: And at this juncture, this is what we talked about when we decided we would focus on that
[0:02:41] SPEAKER_01: so exclusively for an episode.

[0:03:23] SPEAKER_01: Okay, here we go.
[0:03:50] SPEAKER_00: Well, hello everyone and hi, Brooke.
[0:03:53] SPEAKER_00: Hi, Vanessa.
[0:03:54] SPEAKER_00: So today, Brooke and I are actually huddled around one microphone because we are currently
[0:04:01] SPEAKER_00: on our week-long business retreat.
[0:04:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I feel like I'm in a Saturday Night Live skit about NPR where they're huddled
[0:04:09] SPEAKER_01: really close to the mic and kind of trying to look at each other quasi-affectionately,
[0:04:13] SPEAKER_01: but it's super awkward.
[0:04:14] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's actually way more intimate than I'm into.
[0:04:18] SPEAKER_00: But I do like looking at you when we talk, so I'm in an internal bind.
[0:04:24] SPEAKER_00: So we have been on this business retreat and we've been thinking a lot about the future
[0:04:29] SPEAKER_00: of Bliss and Grit and the past of Bliss and Grit.
[0:04:32] SPEAKER_00: And a while back, we actually had someone send us an email asking something to the effect
[0:04:37] SPEAKER_00: of where do you have your whole philosophy laid out?
[0:04:42] SPEAKER_00: And we were like, huh?
[0:04:43] SPEAKER_00: Well, if you listen to a hundred hours worth of content, I'm sure you'll be able to put
[0:04:48] SPEAKER_00: it together.
[0:04:49] SPEAKER_00: And it occurred to us that we've never really put down how we think about things in one
[0:04:56] SPEAKER_00: place.
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_00: And in particular today, what we want to talk about is what we can shorthand call our working
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_00: model of healing or transformation.
[0:05:08] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:05:09] Unknown: And why we do the show, what's the point of view?
[0:05:13] Unknown: show just as two close friends who are on our own deep tracking of our own paths and
[0:05:21] SPEAKER_01: our own healing.
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_01: And we wanted to, and we do it for a living, so we wanted to talk about it in public as
[0:05:26] Unknown: well.
[0:05:28] SPEAKER_01: And we cleared a lot of conditioning, got a lot more open, life's changed a lot.
[0:05:33] Unknown: And it's like, okay, we actually do have working models, working theories to go with.
[0:05:39] SPEAKER_01: I might as well lay it out a little bit more.
[0:05:41] SPEAKER_00: So just like we're people who talk about stuff.
[0:05:44] Unknown: Essentially, we've been like internal cosmonauts and looking up close and personally at how
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_00: does change actually happen?
[0:05:56] SPEAKER_00: Brooke and I both were sharing our personal stories and, you know, we've been working
[0:06:01] SPEAKER_00: with clients almost two decades, we've been on the spiritual path for even longer.
[0:06:07] SPEAKER_00: And we're like, okay, a lot of things we did made us more functional.
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_00: And it definitely lightened our load.
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_00: It made things a little easier, gave us some perspective.
[0:06:17] SPEAKER_00: But if any of you were listening to Bliss and Great at the beginning, you know, you
[0:06:21] SPEAKER_00: would know firsthand, some of it was still so dense and so heavy.
[0:06:26] SPEAKER_00: And as things have begun to shift and clear, we've become increasingly curious that what's
[0:06:31] SPEAKER_00: needed for an actual transformation to happen.
[0:06:34] SPEAKER_00: So we're not just getting more functional in our ego structures, you know, more functional
[0:06:41] SPEAKER_00: in our protective personalities, because even when that happens, what we noticed, I'm putting
[0:06:47] SPEAKER_00: words in your mouth, Brooke, is we both felt still tired, still afraid, still self-doubting.
[0:06:54] SPEAKER_00: And that seems to be a really important part to bring into a transformational conversation,
[0:07:00] Unknown: don't you think?
[0:07:01] SPEAKER_01: And I think that, you know, if we look at, let's say, psychotherapeutic models, the point
[0:07:07] Unknown: of view is a lot of let's become more functional, hugely important.
[0:07:15] Unknown: And then the spiritual model might be like total liberation, total freedom.
[0:07:23] SPEAKER_00: Let's become more enlightened.
[0:07:24] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:07:25] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:07:26] SPEAKER_01: And total, and people, we can see people take it to a degree where it's like total liberation
[0:07:30] SPEAKER_01: from the human experience, which is not also not our point of view, right?
[0:07:34] Unknown: We don't want to just be, you know, the Zen phrase, drunk on emptiness or caught in the
[0:07:40] SPEAKER_01: non-dual space as like the pinnacle of, air quotes, achievement for a human life.
[0:07:45] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm finally there.
[0:07:49] SPEAKER_01: And we've had the great good fortune to talk to so many wonderful people who do this work
[0:07:54] SPEAKER_01: and who teach people who have lived these paths and tracked this process in a very,
[0:07:59] SPEAKER_01: very deep way and from different point of views, primarily, I would say from the spiritual
[0:08:03] SPEAKER_01: point of view, but also about trauma recovery, nervous system regulation, all those kinds
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_01: of things.
[0:08:11] Unknown: So, and what we found is that it's about how all the pieces need to come together and that
[0:08:18] SPEAKER_01: the people who are functioning in what I would call the most healthy and thriving ways are
[0:08:24] Unknown: able to bridge the expansiveness of what might be total freedom with also embodying their
[0:08:32] Unknown: humanity.
[0:08:34] SPEAKER_01: And we've talked about that with a number of people, in particular, Amodimah wrote Embodied
[0:08:37] SPEAKER_01: Enlightenment.
[0:08:38] SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's really what we have people on to talk about.
[0:08:40] SPEAKER_01: So then the question is like, okay, if we're tracking this super closely and living it
[0:08:46] SPEAKER_01: and really exploring it and kind of reporting from the field of our own personal experiences,
[0:08:52] Unknown: then can we break it down a little more?
[0:08:57] Unknown: What are the actual bridges that we're building?
[0:09:01] Unknown: What is it that we want to make sure doesn't get left out from the equation of transformation?
[0:09:10] Unknown: Yeah, so I guess maybe we can just zoom on out and start with that.
[0:09:16] Unknown: Like what is a part of the model that we're working with?
[0:09:19] SPEAKER_00: Okay, great.
[0:09:20] SPEAKER_00: Well, I think some of the backstory because we always get new listeners and they could
[0:09:23] SPEAKER_00: pop in at any episode.
[0:09:26] SPEAKER_00: So not everybody's familiar with Brooke and I, but just before I start to structure some
[0:09:30] SPEAKER_00: of this out, it's good for you to understand that we have both have a background in mind-body
[0:09:34] SPEAKER_00: medicine, energy medicine, and of course, coaching and psychology and different things
[0:09:41] SPEAKER_00: like this.
[0:09:42] SPEAKER_00: So when we started to look at our healing process and we look at the healing processes
[0:09:46] SPEAKER_00: that we were witnessing with our clients, it seemed to us that to thoroughly start to
[0:09:52] SPEAKER_00: transform some of our conditioning that was creating what we call unnecessary suffering,
[0:09:59] SPEAKER_00: we have to start to look at it from all levels, the body, the mind, the energy.
[0:10:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the spirit, but you know what I think is interesting when people say, you know,
[0:10:12] SPEAKER_00: you have to heal on all levels, body, mind, and spirit, I always feel like, well, the
[0:10:16] SPEAKER_00: spirit's fine now.
[0:10:16] Unknown: Like, do we feel like that?
[0:10:18] SPEAKER_00: You know, like the spirit's whole, always has been, always will be, consciousness is
[0:10:24] SPEAKER_00: already awake.
[0:10:25] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:10:26] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:10:27] SPEAKER_00: But what we're looking at is what happened to us, right?
[0:10:30] SPEAKER_00: If we want to say, for example, that let's look at Buddhism 101.
[0:10:36] SPEAKER_00: So Buddha came out with these four truths and he said, okay, suffering exists.
[0:10:41] SPEAKER_00: The human life is suffering is probably closer to what he said.
[0:10:44] SPEAKER_00: And he said, but hey, there's good news.
[0:10:48] SPEAKER_00: There's a way through and you don't have to suffer because you suffer.
[0:10:55] SPEAKER_00: They call that the second arrow teaching, like the first arrow that goes in.
[0:10:58] SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's painful.
[0:10:59] SPEAKER_00: Ouch, that hurts.
[0:11:01] SPEAKER_00: That's really happening.
[0:11:02] SPEAKER_00: There are things happening in the world.
[0:11:03] SPEAKER_00: There's things happening in our human lives and they hurt.
[0:11:07] SPEAKER_00: But then the second arrow is the way we perceive them or the way we judge them or the way we
[0:11:12] SPEAKER_00: push them away or the way that we can't process that emotional experience.
[0:11:17] SPEAKER_00: And so Buddha said, that's the level where we can intervene.
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_00: We can be doctors and we can analyze that this part is adding a lot of pain to the equation
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_00: and we can get to the root of it.
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_00: And in my experience, some of the Buddhist practices were somatic, but a lot had the
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_00: mind state involved.
[0:11:36] SPEAKER_00: What we could see though, even with Buddhism was like, but everybody's fine.
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_00: We're pure.
[0:11:41] Unknown: But what happens is we come into this world, we have past pain that was too much for us
[0:11:49] SPEAKER_00: to metabolize.
[0:11:50] SPEAKER_00: We had neglect, unhealthy childhood support, sometimes abuse.
[0:11:57] SPEAKER_00: We have pain that wasn't processed in our ancestral lineage.
[0:12:02] SPEAKER_00: That's a really big deal.
[0:12:04] SPEAKER_00: We have inherited belief systems that we get from our family and that we get from our culture.
[0:12:10] SPEAKER_00: We're living in current models of toxic culture and to greater or lesser degrees, depending
[0:12:18] SPEAKER_00: on where you live in the world, depending on what color your skin is, depending on your
[0:12:22] SPEAKER_00: socioeconomic group, you're really being exposed to toxic levels of antagonism, threat, violence,
[0:12:30] SPEAKER_00: and all of these different things.
[0:12:31] Unknown: So we come into this world where we're born whole, our spirit is whole, our consciousness
[0:12:37] SPEAKER_00: is evolved.
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_00: But when we're exposed to all of these experiences that create pain within us, and especially
[0:12:45] SPEAKER_00: when we're children, it's too big for our bodies to tolerate.
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_00: It's too big for our nervous systems to tolerate.
[0:12:51] SPEAKER_00: It's too big for our mind to wrap around.
[0:12:54] SPEAKER_00: We start to develop what we could call the ego or we could just call the protective personality.
[0:13:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that one comes from Dr. Sue Mortar, who you and I have been digging on a lot lately.
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: I think it's really important to change words from time to time, and I thought that one
[0:13:10] Unknown: was very precise because its job is to be protective.
[0:13:18] SPEAKER_01: Just a little rewind to everything you were saying, because if we're doing a let's zoom
[0:13:23] Unknown: out, what is Bliss and Grit about kind of episode, we're underscoring that we are about
[0:13:31] SPEAKER_01: deep inquiry into how can we lighten our own load?
[0:13:37] SPEAKER_01: When is it possible and in what ways can we lighten our own load of that second arrow
[0:13:42] SPEAKER_01: suffering, the suffering on top of suffering?
[0:13:44] SPEAKER_01: The question is there suffering out there in the world in a human life?
[0:13:50] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely.
[0:13:51] SPEAKER_01: And there are phenomenal human beings doing really, really pointed, thoughtful healing
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_01: work about that larger picture.
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, what's the inquiry?
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_01: We're of the frame of its inside out.
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_01: The more each of us as individuals can get free, acknowledging that that freedom is easier
[0:14:13] SPEAKER_01: for some than for others within a toxic, fractured culture, for sure.
[0:14:18] SPEAKER_01: But the more that we can do that and the more that we can talk about what that process looks
[0:14:22] SPEAKER_01: like, because it's something really precise and because we're in a fractured culture,
[0:14:26] SPEAKER_01: toxic culture, we don't have it modeled.
[0:14:29] SPEAKER_01: So it's like if you were born into a world where there was no pleasure at all, no one
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_01: experienced pleasure.
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_01: It's just like something about this world doesn't have pleasure.
[0:14:39] SPEAKER_01: It would be very hard to find your way to pleasure if nobody could demonstrate pleasure.
[0:14:46] Unknown: So it's like it's very hard in an unhealthy culture to find your way to freedom, to find
[0:14:53] SPEAKER_01: your way to wholeness if nobody is demonstrating it.
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_01: So we're hoping that we can be talking with the people who are and living the inquiries
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_01: where we can find more and more examples.
[0:15:04] SPEAKER_00: I'm laughing because that example you just gave made me think of like Footloose, the
[0:15:09] SPEAKER_00: town in Footloose.
[0:15:10] SPEAKER_00: I love how you went down to Footloose.
[0:15:13] SPEAKER_00: No one was dancing, so they really didn't know how to dance till Kevin Bacon came in
[0:15:18] SPEAKER_00: and modeled it.
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_00: But there was a transmission and it took fire.
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_00: Footloose has a spiritual teaching, engaging ourselves.
[0:15:27] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_00: I mean, ultimately what we're looking at and one of my favorite books on this is John Wellwood,
[0:15:38] SPEAKER_00: The Psychology of Awakening.
[0:15:41] SPEAKER_00: That's what it is, The Psychology of Awakening.
[0:15:43] SPEAKER_00: He basically describes like how does the protective personality form.
[0:15:47] SPEAKER_00: He calls it like the you can call it the false self, the conditioned self, the ego.
[0:15:51] SPEAKER_00: But he basically goes into it and it's a really, really nice book on Buddhist psychology.
[0:15:56] SPEAKER_00: If you're interested.
[0:15:57] SPEAKER_00: But if we look at it quite simply, I don't think any of us gets out of having this protective
[0:16:02] SPEAKER_00: personality, which is different than the ego structure of the body that says, oh, this
[0:16:07] SPEAKER_00: is Vanessa, that's Brooke.
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_00: It's like a compilation of agendas and behaviors and ways of engaging and bodily patterns.
[0:16:18] SPEAKER_00: It's like emotions even.
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: It's like a compilation of things that our unconscious decided were the best way to operate
[0:16:29] SPEAKER_00: in any given moment to stay safe and or to receive love.
[0:16:34] SPEAKER_00: Because all of those things that we just listed in the beginning, ultimately, what are they doing?
[0:16:39] SPEAKER_00: They're either making us feel like objects, which means we don't feel seen, we don't feel heard,
[0:16:44] SPEAKER_00: which means it hurts our hearts.
[0:16:47] SPEAKER_00: Or they're making us feel literally unsafe, right?
[0:16:50] SPEAKER_00: Like someone could physically harm me.
[0:16:53] SPEAKER_00: Or they're teaching us that love is very conditional, which makes us believe, okay,
[0:16:58] SPEAKER_00: then I could lose love.
[0:16:59] SPEAKER_00: I can be rejected.
[0:17:00] Unknown: I could be outcast, which to the limbic brain is considered a survival threat.
[0:17:07] SPEAKER_00: I think that's so important to know because sometimes we think to ourselves like, well,
[0:17:11] SPEAKER_00: I should be okay alone or I should be okay not caring if this person loves me.
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_00: To your limbic brain, it registers as the same level of survival threat as if somebody was
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_00: yelling at you, right?
[0:17:23] SPEAKER_00: Like if someone felt threatening to you.
[0:17:25] SPEAKER_00: These different things happen.
[0:17:27] SPEAKER_00: They create those states of unsafety or objectification or fear of rejection, fear of loss.
[0:17:36] SPEAKER_00: We start to have, I guess we start to try to be the best version of ourselves instead of living
[0:17:43] SPEAKER_00: from a spontaneous level.
[0:17:45] SPEAKER_00: To live from the soul is this kind of spontaneous, what Alan Watts would call self-so existence.
[0:17:56] SPEAKER_00: Most of us have learned, well, listen, there's ways of being that keep me safer.
[0:18:00] SPEAKER_00: There's ways of being that keep people liking me more.
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_00: There's ways of being that keep my image of myself intact.
[0:18:07] SPEAKER_00: Then those become habits and those habits get conditioned into the body.
[0:18:12] SPEAKER_00: They get conditioned into the mind.
[0:18:14] SPEAKER_00: So deeply that we start to think that's who I am.
[0:18:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:18:19] SPEAKER_01: That's why we call it, and I think it's really important to always underscore this.
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_01: We call this unconscious mind or unconscious material because it's actually,
[0:18:28] SPEAKER_01: until we're aware of it, as soon as we're aware of it, it's no longer unconscious mind.
[0:18:32] SPEAKER_01: It's no longer unconscious material.
[0:18:34] SPEAKER_01: For as long as it is, it means we cannot be conscious of it.
[0:18:38] SPEAKER_01: This is about the process of how do we become more conscious of,
[0:18:42] SPEAKER_01: I really like the term that we came across via Jill Blakeway and her work with Neil
[0:18:47] SPEAKER_01: Donald Walsh, the sponsoring thought.
[0:18:49] SPEAKER_01: Like what are the sponsoring thoughts?
[0:18:51] SPEAKER_01: If I'm too smart, I will be rejected by my family.
[0:18:56] SPEAKER_01: And so you start to develop the persona, the identity at a very, very young age,
[0:19:00] SPEAKER_01: unconsciously of dumbing yourself down a little bit.
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_01: Or if I'm the sexy one, I get to exist.
[0:19:07] SPEAKER_01: So then you start operating all the way through the I'm the sexy one thought.
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_01: But until these sponsoring thoughts are brought up to the level of consciousness,
[0:19:16] SPEAKER_01: they just run us and we believe that it's the entirety of who we are.
[0:19:20] SPEAKER_01: And this is from the point of view of the divine.
[0:19:24] SPEAKER_01: Well, the divine is like do whatevs, but let's say from a different point of view of consciousness,
[0:19:29] SPEAKER_01: it's heartbreaking because there's all this potential there.
[0:19:31] SPEAKER_01: There's potential to just simply delight in whatever is happening in any given moment
[0:19:38] SPEAKER_01: in your human life to be able to do things like either quesadilla like we just did,
[0:19:43] SPEAKER_01: to be able to laugh with a friend.
[0:19:48] SPEAKER_01: The potential to have more flow in your life, more creativity to come through these things
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_01: can't happen if we're so busy running our protective strategies, which is also exhausting,
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_01: which is one of the extra benefits of sharing.
[0:20:02] SPEAKER_00: I feel like, okay, so I really don't know the secret of the universe and why we're here.
[0:20:07] SPEAKER_00: But sometimes I feel, okay, well, maybe it's just a game.
[0:20:10] SPEAKER_00: Like it's a game of hide and seek.
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so your soul, your beautiful light is hidden somewhere in the body and we spend our life,
[0:20:18] SPEAKER_00: you know, seeking it out.
[0:20:19] Unknown: There's this way that I always visualized it, you know, the easiest when we think of conditioning,
[0:20:25] SPEAKER_00: which we're going to break down how conditioning as we can see it so far gets held or gets stored.
[0:20:31] SPEAKER_00: But as far as I can visualize it, I always think of it as, and I think this is a parable
[0:20:38] SPEAKER_00: that I'm spacing out on the name of, but I think of it as like having 10 different layers of clothes
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_00: on top of you, right?
[0:20:44] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, you know, slowly beginning to take off these layers so you can find yourself.
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_00: So I don't even know if like a different level, it would be heartbreaking on a certain level,
[0:20:55] SPEAKER_00: it may be like, that's the game of humans.
[0:20:58] SPEAKER_00: But for us, it's certainly heartbreaking.
[0:21:00] SPEAKER_00: It's heartbreaking for me to look back at my life and you're like, oh, look at the suffering.
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_00: It feels like look at the suffering I was created, but it's so unconscious that there
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_00: was never a choice.
[0:21:12] SPEAKER_00: I mean, that's the whole interesting bit about conditioning and why it's important to emphasize
[0:21:17] SPEAKER_00: that it's unconscious is like, okay, I think it was a couple of weeks back, we aired an episode
[0:21:23] SPEAKER_00: where we emphasize Fawn, but we talked about fight, flight, Fawn, freeze, right?
[0:21:27] SPEAKER_00: These nervous system patterns.
[0:21:29] SPEAKER_00: Well, no one ever sat around and said, you know, it's a good idea.
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_00: I think I'm going to become a freeze person.
[0:21:36] SPEAKER_00: We didn't choose to become the person who runs and feels like they have to escape their
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_00: life all the time.
[0:21:43] SPEAKER_00: Nothing about our conditioning.
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_00: Did we ever have a volitional choice?
[0:21:49] SPEAKER_00: But when we look sometimes we're like, oh, man, I wish.
[0:21:53] SPEAKER_00: I wish I had seen then what I can see now.
[0:21:57] Unknown: And, you know, that's hard.
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_00: I've sat with that before, but my general, I guess, energy towards it all is like this
[0:22:04] SPEAKER_00: life is this wonderful, interesting game and adventure.
[0:22:09] Unknown: And we can always open up more space.
[0:22:14] SPEAKER_00: There's always more alignment available.
[0:22:16] SPEAKER_00: There's always greater potential.
[0:22:19] SPEAKER_00: And I think it's obvious for us.
[0:22:20] Unknown: We can say we have transformed so much, so much, and life certainly feels more spacious
[0:22:28] SPEAKER_00: inside, doesn't it?
[0:22:30] Unknown: Yeah, literally physically spacious, which is fascinating.
[0:22:34] SPEAKER_01: We'll get to that maybe when we talk about some of the ways that this stored.
[0:22:37] Unknown: But so we can talk about that there is these ways that conditioning stores in us, that
[0:22:46] Unknown: in us, that there are these unconscious thought forms, physical patterns, way we hold ourselves
[0:22:54] SPEAKER_01: or carry ourselves in our body, that there are these ways that these unconsciously and
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_01: in a sense take on form that starts to get filtered as me.
[0:23:06] SPEAKER_01: And so a lot of therapeutic modalities, therapy or let's say, you know, the spiritual path
[0:23:14] Unknown: are in certain different ways from their angle, their point of view, looking at like,
[0:23:21] SPEAKER_01: okay, well, how do we deal with the stored conditioning?
[0:23:25] Unknown: But what we found is that they kind of we need to be building the bridges, which I think
[0:23:30] SPEAKER_01: is what you and I have experientially gotten really interested in doing because we can
[0:23:34] SPEAKER_01: shed a bunch in like a like for me, so much got cleared through really good, really astute
[0:23:42] SPEAKER_01: trauma therapy, including, you know, EMDR, including lens neurofeedback, things like that.
[0:23:48] SPEAKER_01: And then, you know, and then and then I had to discover it from these different angles
[0:23:52] SPEAKER_01: in these different places.
[0:23:53] SPEAKER_01: So a few different places that you and I talk about specifically, like, how does conditioning
[0:24:00] SPEAKER_01: store therefore, how do we sort of heal it, expose it, whatever word you want to use,
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_01: it stores at the level of the body.
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_01: It stores at the level of the mind and it stores at the level of energy.
[0:24:14] SPEAKER_01: So we'll go into what that means more precisely.
[0:24:17] SPEAKER_01: But for example, let's say you're dealing with a therapeutic frame that is, let's say,
[0:24:25] Unknown: far end of the spectrum non duality that says, you are not your body, you are not anything,
[0:24:32] SPEAKER_01: you are just the divine light of pure consciousness, just be here right now.
[0:24:37] SPEAKER_01: And if you can just be here right now with the now, then you will be free.
[0:24:44] SPEAKER_01: But what we see is that like, well, well, we are in in bodies and that some of the ways
[0:24:49] SPEAKER_01: the conditioning might store is in the body.
[0:24:52] SPEAKER_01: So if we leave it out of the equation entirely, we can't go to there, we can't experience
[0:24:57] SPEAKER_01: the moment, we can't just be here now.
[0:25:00] SPEAKER_01: If our limbic brain is caught in, let's say, a pattern of flight, and our body is really
[0:25:07] SPEAKER_01: clenched and compressed around our heart and our throat, that there have to be these
[0:25:11] SPEAKER_01: different ways of shedding things, and that they need to all be put together instead of,
[0:25:15] Unknown: oh, just go to the non dual space or just talk it out, talk about your past, talk about
[0:25:22] SPEAKER_01: what happened, get context.
[0:25:24] SPEAKER_01: But context and the non dual space, really helpful.
[0:25:27] SPEAKER_01: Smash them together.
[0:25:29] SPEAKER_00: You got avocado toast of transformation.
[0:25:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think also, maybe it's useful to just understand, you know, on this show, we talk a
[0:25:38] SPEAKER_00: lot about spiritual awakening.
[0:25:40] SPEAKER_00: We also talk about healing, we talk about transformation.
[0:25:43] SPEAKER_00: One of the things we're passionate about is that I think all of us are very aware of some
[0:25:49] SPEAKER_00: of the spiritual teacher misconduct that can happen, whether we're talking about a religious
[0:25:53] SPEAKER_00: organization, and it happening within, you know, churches and stuff like that.
[0:25:59] SPEAKER_00: It happening within churches and synagogues or such, mosques maybe.
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_00: I actually haven't heard a lot about that, but I'm sure that might happen.
[0:26:08] SPEAKER_00: Or whether we're talking about Buddhist teachers or, you know, other kinds of spiritual teachers.
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_01: Contemporary Western guru types.
[0:26:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, whatever it is.
[0:26:20] SPEAKER_00: We've heard so much of it, and that's been an area of disappointment and real curiosity for us.
[0:26:27] SPEAKER_00: I think why we're disappointed, like deeply disappointed in that is obvious.
[0:26:33] SPEAKER_00: But then curiosity, because you can sit with a teacher who can have so much clarity and
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_00: really be so helpful.
[0:26:44] SPEAKER_00: I mean, there was one teacher who came out of India, his name was Sai Baba, who there's a huge
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_00: scandal around.
[0:26:51] SPEAKER_00: I never did a lot of research about it, but it was like something about sleeping with little boys.
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_00: But the teachers who studied with him, there's some amazing ones underneath that guy's name.
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_00: People who have met him had tremendous energetic transformation.
[0:27:08] SPEAKER_00: I mean, tremendous life changing, mind expanding, transcendent transformation.
[0:27:13] SPEAKER_00: So we were like, how's this possible?
[0:27:16] SPEAKER_00: How could you be awake to God?
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_00: How could you know that we're all one?
[0:27:22] SPEAKER_00: And yet, how can these atrocities be committed?
[0:27:26] SPEAKER_00: And for us, that got us thinking like, well, it seems very clear that psychological healing,
[0:27:33] SPEAKER_00: we could call it.
[0:27:35] SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's energetic healing.
[0:27:37] SPEAKER_00: This is still a working model.
[0:27:38] SPEAKER_00: We're filling in a lot of blanks here as we go.
[0:27:41] SPEAKER_00: But psychological healing, energetic healing is different sometimes than certain forms of awakening.
[0:27:49] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know if it's like what Adyashanti says when he says you awaken at the level of the
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_00: head, the heart and the body, maybe some of those people have awakened just in one aspect.
[0:27:59] SPEAKER_00: I really haven't done a thorough analysis of it.
[0:28:01] SPEAKER_00: But what gets us jazzed is like, look, awake or not, right?
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_00: We're all awakening, right?
[0:28:09] SPEAKER_00: We're all in a process.
[0:28:10] SPEAKER_00: Anyone who's listening to this is in a process of coming to consciousness,
[0:28:14] SPEAKER_00: greater and greater consciousness.
[0:28:16] SPEAKER_00: But whether we reach this like ultimate state they used to call enlightenment or not,
[0:28:22] Unknown: we have so much human potential to embody our wholeness,
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_00: to know that we're more than we ever knew we were, to love ourselves, to love life,
[0:28:36] SPEAKER_00: to love each other, right?
[0:28:39] SPEAKER_00: Those things are human potential.
[0:28:43] SPEAKER_00: And we've cracked the code on how to get there.
[0:28:49] SPEAKER_01: Follow this 12-step blueprint.
[0:28:51] SPEAKER_01: Blueprint.
[0:28:52] Unknown: Yeah, it's a lived inquiry.
[0:28:59] SPEAKER_01: It's a lived exploration.
[0:29:02] SPEAKER_01: And it's right there in the intro to our show.
[0:29:05] Unknown: How do we embrace everything, our humanity?
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_01: How do we embrace our divine?
[0:29:12] Unknown: And how do we take this as a really exciting time and exciting opportunity?
[0:29:19] SPEAKER_01: If we can have these kinds of conversations that we can bring something different to this place,
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_01: whatever it is.
[0:29:27] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:29:27] SPEAKER_01: Is this earth?
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_01: Are we talking about earth?
[0:29:29] SPEAKER_01: When you say place, yeah.
[0:29:30] SPEAKER_01: Please.
[0:29:30] SPEAKER_01: Whatever this earth is, that we can shift things by starting to even entertain the possibility of
[0:29:40] SPEAKER_01: freedom and what that looks like.
[0:29:41] SPEAKER_01: So, one thing that we mentioned, and maybe we can just like dial it in a little bit on the body.
[0:29:48] SPEAKER_01: So, there's one way that this stores.
[0:29:52] SPEAKER_01: One of the three ways we mentioned body-mind energy.
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_01: And that is the body.
[0:29:56] SPEAKER_01: So, if we leave the body out, we're likely to just get a little wobbly or a little clunky somewhere.
[0:30:04] Unknown: And one of the ways that I like to think about body,
[0:30:09] SPEAKER_01: probably especially it's the most tangible to me because I'm a ropher and I've worked in people's
[0:30:13] SPEAKER_01: tissue for 20 years.
[0:30:15] SPEAKER_01: I love how Judith Blackstone talks about,
[0:30:17] SPEAKER_01: if we feel that we're under threat, whether that threat is actual physical, something coming at us,
[0:30:23] SPEAKER_01: or emotional threat, or ideological threat, meaning you belong to this family,
[0:30:30] SPEAKER_01: if you're not smarter than the dad figure, right?
[0:30:33] SPEAKER_01: Then you're included.
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_01: Or if you're the extrovert, and maybe you would have naturally been more of an introvert type.
[0:30:42] SPEAKER_01: That the only way that we can actually protect ourselves in those kinds of situations is to
[0:30:48] SPEAKER_01: literally physically contract.
[0:30:50] SPEAKER_01: And that we contract on this sort of tiny, I think of it as like the fascicles, these little
[0:30:57] SPEAKER_01: pods within our fascia, the way the little bits of tissue are wrapped deep inside us.
[0:31:02] SPEAKER_01: That there's this contraction that almost, if you can picture it,
[0:31:06] SPEAKER_01: I would imagine maybe it even goes down to cellular contraction.
[0:31:09] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:31:10] SPEAKER_01: So I'm not talking about this from the point of view of like, I read this research paper
[0:31:13] Unknown: and this is fascinating, but we can read people like Bruce Lipton, who takes it into the cellular
[0:31:19] SPEAKER_01: place, but there is an actual contract.
[0:31:22] SPEAKER_01: And that that pattern starts to become a part of the personality.
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_01: So when we were working with Judith Blackstone, she might talk about,
[0:31:32] SPEAKER_01: well, let's look at the larger cultural pattern, because I see this constantly.
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_01: Culturally, we're people who orient from the head.
[0:31:41] SPEAKER_01: And from the head, I mean like the eyes and the forehead and kind of the front.
[0:31:45] SPEAKER_01: And with this almost like narrowed forward way of being that this is the way to be.
[0:31:50] SPEAKER_01: When I go do something like sit with John Prendergast and I play with or Judith Blackstone
[0:31:55] Unknown: and I play with sitting in the heart, it's like traveling to a different land.
[0:32:00] SPEAKER_01: It's like traveling to a foreign land in terms of the culture that we operate within.
[0:32:04] SPEAKER_00: Do you want to say what sitting means when you say sitting in the heart?
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_01: That awareness can go and be there.
[0:32:12] SPEAKER_01: So I'm trying to think of a way that I would describe it.
[0:32:14] SPEAKER_01: A lot of people who are listening know because we're playing with moving awareness around.
[0:32:18] Unknown: But like if somebody who's listening right now can look at an object in the room,
[0:32:28] SPEAKER_01: literally an object, a lamp, a picture, a window.
[0:32:31] Unknown: And if you look at it from your forehead, so imagine awareness goes into the forehead,
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_01: goes into the eyes, the very front, upfront kind of blinders on.
[0:32:40] SPEAKER_01: And it looks at the object from that place or goes towards the object from that place.
[0:32:45] SPEAKER_01: That's one location.
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_01: And then if we can play with awareness settling downward and in and sitting in the heart.
[0:32:54] SPEAKER_01: And if we can stay sitting in the heart, and this is something that doesn't happen in two
[0:32:57] SPEAKER_01: seconds on a podcast, I would lead this in a much slower, more thoughtful way
[0:33:01] SPEAKER_01: when working with someone.
[0:33:04] Unknown: But if you can go sit in the heart and then gaze at the object,
[0:33:08] Unknown: it just becomes a different frame of reference for awareness.
[0:33:13] SPEAKER_01: So that's a cultural piece.
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_01: But if we look at an individual, let's say that they're another common one is a lot of
[0:33:19] SPEAKER_01: heart shutting down, like not safe to take up space, not safe to exist.
[0:33:24] SPEAKER_01: And maybe it was a very shouty household and it was a highly sensitive person,
[0:33:28] SPEAKER_01: there's a contraction around the chest and they get just subtly shut down in that area,
[0:33:33] SPEAKER_01: just dampened, a little bit pulling shoulders in a little bit contracted down.
[0:33:39] SPEAKER_01: And that changes their way of being in the world.
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_01: It limits their way of being in the world and it translates into a personality
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_01: or it translates into one tiny aspect of personality.
[0:33:52] SPEAKER_00: Gosh, I'm just thinking about how it's very common that you'll see tight throats and tight jaws.
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_00: A lot of my clients happen to be women.
[0:34:02] SPEAKER_00: So I don't know if there's a cultural piece to this, but the sense that you can't
[0:34:06] SPEAKER_00: express yourself, that you can't be yourself at the level of expression
[0:34:10] SPEAKER_00: can create this tightening in the throat.
[0:34:13] SPEAKER_00: And if you have, let's say, repressed emotion, repressed anger, you can tighten up the jaw.
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_00: And I'm just thinking, oh my God, my jaw is so much looser these days.
[0:34:24] SPEAKER_00: I never have jaw pain.
[0:34:26] SPEAKER_00: And let me just say, I had a lot of repressed anger in my system.
[0:34:30] SPEAKER_00: This concept of conditioning storing at the level of the body has been talked about in
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_00: certain psychological circles for a long time, like Wilhelm Reich would talk about it.
[0:34:40] SPEAKER_00: This was written about, we now have this beautiful world of somatic psychology, like hallelujah.
[0:34:47] SPEAKER_00: But it's cool to start to notice, like, right, okay,
[0:34:50] Unknown: so my body is holding a pattern of protection, right?
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_00: This protective personality doesn't just come with thoughts.
[0:34:59] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't just come with beliefs.
[0:35:00] SPEAKER_00: It comes with emotions.
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_00: It comes with energetic patterning.
[0:35:04] SPEAKER_00: And it comes with certain body patterning that includes tensions and contractions in my tissues.
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_00: That includes cellular changes, DNA changes, things like that.
[0:35:15] SPEAKER_00: And that includes nervous system dysregulation.
[0:35:19] SPEAKER_00: And for us, what's interesting is we did so much work at the level of the tissues in the body.
[0:35:25] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:35:26] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I've been ralphed by Brooke, had a 10 series.
[0:35:30] SPEAKER_00: You've been ralphed, obviously.
[0:35:31] SPEAKER_00: We've done craniosacral therapy, some Hacomian somatic approaches to psychology I've done.
[0:35:38] Unknown: We've both done EMDR, which probably maybe relates with the nervous system.
[0:35:43] SPEAKER_00: But we did a lot of somatic approaches.
[0:35:46] SPEAKER_00: But it was important to look at both aspects of the body for us, right?
[0:35:51] SPEAKER_00: What we could see is that we were showing symptoms of nervous system dysregulation
[0:35:58] SPEAKER_00: in association with our protective personality.
[0:36:00] SPEAKER_00: I haven't done enough.
[0:36:01] SPEAKER_00: This is still fairly new for me that I'm really deeply looking at the nervous system as part of it.
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_00: So I can't say I've seen thousands of people to give a definitive answer.
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_00: But I would imagine that all protective personalities have some nervous system
[0:36:19] SPEAKER_00: dysregulation associated with it.
[0:36:20] SPEAKER_00: Would you think the same?
[0:36:21] SPEAKER_01: I would think so, yeah, because it's based on operating from survival mode.
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_01: And if we're only operating in survival mode, there has to be dysregulation in the nervous
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_01: system because we're not always in a survival situation.
[0:36:34] Unknown: Most of the time, we're in normal, safe situations for the vast majority of us.
[0:36:42] SPEAKER_01: Literally fending off attack or that kind of thing.
[0:36:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but our conditioning can say that that is the constant state, particularly
[0:36:51] SPEAKER_01: culture that objectifies people.
[0:36:53] SPEAKER_01: They're only worth how much they can produce.
[0:36:55] Unknown: And we have to work hard and 80-hour work weeks, blah, blah, blah.
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_00: If you're not like this, you're not good and you're not valuable.
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_01: You're not going to survive.
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_01: You're not going to make it.
[0:37:05] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:37:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm just thinking about a while back, I had pulled this quote from Emota Ma.
[0:37:12] SPEAKER_00: She was in an interview with Rick Archer on Buddha at the Gas Pump podcast.
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_00: And she was talking about how awakening is really a state of non-reactivity in the nervous
[0:37:23] SPEAKER_00: system that, you know, as you clear reactivities, because your nervous system is holding
[0:37:30] SPEAKER_00: conditioning as well.
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_00: It's holding habits.
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_00: It's responding before you could possibly have a thought.
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_01: You know what I'm going to do?
[0:37:38] SPEAKER_00: It's not a strategy that gets thought through at the level of the conscious mind.
[0:37:41] SPEAKER_00: No, half the time you're not even aware.
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_00: It's like my heart's pounding and you have no idea why.
[0:37:46] SPEAKER_00: It's not that even something registered in consciousness to say, oh, that person pissed
[0:37:50] SPEAKER_00: me off.
[0:37:51] SPEAKER_00: That happens sometimes.
[0:37:52] SPEAKER_00: But if your protective mechanism is good enough, especially when you have a fawn type
[0:37:57] SPEAKER_00: like me, you know, if it's good enough, it'll keep what upset you even under conscious
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_00: route.
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_00: You won't know.
[0:38:04] SPEAKER_00: But all of a sudden your body will go into a state of dysregulation and then there'll
[0:38:08] SPEAKER_00: be some symptom that will arise.
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_00: Either we'll get chronically ill or we'll get mad at someone that it really had nothing
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: to do with.
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: Like something else will happen.
[0:38:18] Unknown: So I love that we got to begin to understand that as you clear these reactivities, there's
[0:38:28] SPEAKER_00: life beyond reactivity.
[0:38:30] SPEAKER_00: There's life beyond your past.
[0:38:33] Unknown: Because what all this conditioning is, if you kind of got this already or not, what
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_00: we're saying is conditioning is the past showing up in the present.
[0:38:43] SPEAKER_00: And that's what we mean by unnecessary suffering.
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_00: If you actually have something you're confronting in the present, can't feed yourself.
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: Someone's threatening you physically.
[0:38:54] SPEAKER_00: You're in an abusive marriage.
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_00: If something's currently threatening you, your nervous system should get into action.
[0:39:02] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:39:02] SPEAKER_00: That's normal and that's healthy.
[0:39:05] Unknown: But when we're talking about conditioning, we're talking about how the things you've
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_00: been through in the past or the things your family has been through in the past or the
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_00: things you were taught by your culture in the past are now showing up in present time
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_00: where they don't need to be.
[0:39:24] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:39:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:39:26] SPEAKER_01: And so this maybe gets to the other place that I think is really helpful to look at,
[0:39:31] SPEAKER_01: which is the mind.
[0:39:32] Unknown: So I can unbind things in my physical body.
[0:39:36] Unknown: I can do a lot of work to, which is maybe we would say the bottom up approach, like
[0:39:42] SPEAKER_01: unbind the tissue and things change at the level of the nervous system.
[0:39:46] SPEAKER_01: The top down approach is the sort of nervous system approach.
[0:39:48] SPEAKER_01: Things we've done like DNRS or we spoke with Lisa Wimberger of Neurosculpting,
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: regulating the nervous system from that point of view.
[0:39:56] SPEAKER_01: Very helpful.
[0:39:57] SPEAKER_01: And context can be really helpful too.
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_01: Like, well, if we can bring them up to the level of the consciousness,
[0:40:04] SPEAKER_01: a level of consciousness, what are the sponsoring thoughts?
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_01: What are the thoughts underneath a thing?
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_01: What are the beliefs that this one was fed at an age when this one didn't have a say
[0:40:17] SPEAKER_01: about whether or not they agreed or the level of consciousness or maturity to say like,
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_01: yeah, that's true or yeah, that doesn't feel true to me.
[0:40:24] Unknown: It's just like a belief is handed to you and the way that these things can habitually keep
[0:40:31] SPEAKER_01: playing out.
[0:40:32] SPEAKER_01: And usually we'll see that in our life.
[0:40:35] SPEAKER_01: Something keeps replicating, right?
[0:40:37] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, why?
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_01: What are the thoughts I'm having or the belief systems I'm having
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_01: underneath my day-to-day life, which if I look at the actual life,
[0:40:48] SPEAKER_01: looks pretty normative, let's say, but something keeps playing out.
[0:40:52] SPEAKER_01: Or, you know, and these can be thoughts of personality,
[0:40:55] SPEAKER_01: like I'm always the one that it never works out for, right?
[0:40:59] SPEAKER_01: I'm always the one that blah, blah, blah.
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: Or I need to work really hard to make it to the top of the ladder.
[0:41:06] SPEAKER_01: And then I'll be the one.
[0:41:09] SPEAKER_01: That's something that's handed to a lot of us via family and via culture
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_01: in like late capitalist world.
[0:41:17] Unknown: And that seeing those for me with clarity, bringing them up from the level of just
[0:41:23] SPEAKER_01: unconscious habit into going, oh, there was this sponsoring thought.
[0:41:28] SPEAKER_01: There was something that was playing out underneath my behavior,
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_01: underneath my action that I didn't see before.
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_01: One work piece of work that's been very helpful for me is Byron Cady's work called The Work.
[0:41:40] Unknown: Really, really good for me to even like way after shedding, it was,
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_01: I've been using her work for a long time.
[0:41:47] SPEAKER_01: So it helps me to get much more free in the beginning too,
[0:41:49] SPEAKER_01: when I wasn't nearly as conscious.
[0:41:52] Unknown: And then even now, because a thought can come up and it's easier for me to see the thought,
[0:41:58] SPEAKER_01: but it's still great to have a way to make it a little bit workable just to inquire.
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_01: Like, is that true?
[0:42:03] SPEAKER_01: Can I absolutely know that that's true?
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_01: And it starts to pop some of those bubbles of thought forms and bring me back to
[0:42:10] SPEAKER_01: whatever's actually happening, whatever potential is actually there.
[0:42:14] SPEAKER_00: I like the way Byron Cady differentiates between belief and thought.
[0:42:18] SPEAKER_00: Like, it's not thoughts that are a problem.
[0:42:20] SPEAKER_00: It's what you believe.
[0:42:21] SPEAKER_00: It's if you believe your thoughts that it's a problem.
[0:42:24] SPEAKER_00: Because, you know, thoughts will just kind of float through your head.
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_00: I mean, sometimes just because you're empathic, a thought will float through your head.
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_00: You're picking it up from your radio antenna, you know.
[0:42:33] SPEAKER_00: Thoughts will float through your head, but it's like what got wired in that you believed.
[0:42:38] SPEAKER_00: And when you think about the mind and how powerful it is,
[0:42:43] SPEAKER_00: that's when we start to get all the interesting research,
[0:42:46] SPEAKER_00: let's say, on the effect on cells and DNA of like our thoughts.
[0:42:50] SPEAKER_00: Now, for us, when we started to look at thought and the power of thought,
[0:42:54] SPEAKER_00: and should we be using positive thinking,
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_00: that seemed overly simplistic.
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
[0:43:01] SPEAKER_00: Like, it didn't-
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_00: Unpainful.
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_00: Just a new form of contraction.
[0:43:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it just didn't seem to work, you know, quite frankly.
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_00: Like, we are game to experiment with anything.
[0:43:12] SPEAKER_00: But if you observe when you look around at others, and maybe if you've done this yourself,
[0:43:18] SPEAKER_00: when you try to just positive think, it's futile.
[0:43:21] SPEAKER_00: Because everything is coming from your unconscious.
[0:43:23] SPEAKER_00: It's the unconscious mind that's really dictating the experience of your body.
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_00: So we realized, okay, that's not going to work.
[0:43:32] SPEAKER_00: So what do I do?
[0:43:34] SPEAKER_00: Because, for example, if I have a belief,
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_00: let's say that I'm not safe around men.
[0:43:42] SPEAKER_00: Let's say that something happened to me early in my childhood where I wasn't safe around men,
[0:43:47] SPEAKER_00: a man, and that belief got stored in my circuitry.
[0:43:53] SPEAKER_00: Then what happens is, as I walk around in the world,
[0:43:56] SPEAKER_00: my nervous system is dysregulating every time a man's walking by.
[0:44:01] SPEAKER_00: Now, depending on what you've been through and the kind of beliefs that have been wired into
[0:44:05] SPEAKER_00: your system, you can see how the mind and the nervous system and the contractions and the
[0:44:11] SPEAKER_00: tissues and the cells are all playing together, right?
[0:44:15] SPEAKER_00: Like, that belief, depending on what your belief is, I'm not safe to exist.
[0:44:20] SPEAKER_00: Okay, you're probably only going to feel regulated when you're home alone
[0:44:25] SPEAKER_00: in that case, right?
[0:44:26] SPEAKER_00: So the belief is really important.
[0:44:29] SPEAKER_00: But coming at it from the level of positive thinking, that doesn't work.
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_00: It's nice.
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_00: Hey, turn away from a thought every once in a while.
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_00: Don't go down that whole complaint rabbit hole.
[0:44:39] SPEAKER_00: Maybe don't vent this time.
[0:44:41] Unknown: These are all positive tools, but it's not going to create a transformation.
[0:44:46] SPEAKER_00: So what we started to look at is like, okay, well,
[0:44:49] Unknown: how do we start to see these deep unconscious beliefs?
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_00: And as we see them, what do we do with them?
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_00: Like, we don't want to believe them anymore.
[0:45:01] SPEAKER_00: What do we do?
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_00: You want to answer that?
[0:45:03] SPEAKER_01: I mean, for me personally, the thing that's been the most helpful, first of all,
[0:45:07] Unknown: awareness for starters, that I can see them at all.
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_01: And I say this to clients all the time.
[0:45:12] SPEAKER_01: Huge, already huge.
[0:45:13] SPEAKER_01: We have to take a moment and be so grateful for the ability to have awareness.
[0:45:18] SPEAKER_01: I see that this thought is running my life or is running this moment.
[0:45:22] SPEAKER_00: I think sometimes awareness starts to increase the more curious you get about this.
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_00: If people say, well, how do I get enough awareness?
[0:45:30] SPEAKER_00: How do I get enough spaciousness to even see the belief or see the thought?
[0:45:35] SPEAKER_00: Usually one, meditation is a way in.
[0:45:38] SPEAKER_00: And two, what I've noticed is just if you're really curious,
[0:45:43] SPEAKER_00: what is it that keeps creating this internal sense of lack or this internal sense of suffering?
[0:45:49] SPEAKER_00: If you're curious enough, awareness starts to develop.
[0:45:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:45:52] SPEAKER_01: Then you'll maybe start to hear some of the thoughts in a given moment, like of something
[0:45:56] SPEAKER_01: banal.
[0:45:56] SPEAKER_01: You're going to the grocery store and your mind is saying, I shouldn't have to go to the grocery
[0:46:01] SPEAKER_01: store.
[0:46:02] SPEAKER_01: And it's like attention getting because it's like, well, who's this one who's like,
[0:46:05] SPEAKER_01: I shouldn't have to.
[0:46:06] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't feel good.
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: So it catches my attention.
[0:46:09] SPEAKER_01: And then if you play with it, maybe it starts to get tied to a larger
[0:46:17] SPEAKER_01: martyr pattern.
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_01: Coming up with a make believe example.
[0:46:20] Unknown: But this is where that I'm curious point of view can really lead things.
[0:46:28] SPEAKER_01: And for me, in those moments when I was ready to just like gut renovation, total demo day
[0:46:36] Unknown: with thoughts, Byron Katie's work has been tremendously helpful.
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_01: And I've come back to that over and over and over again, no matter what level of consciousness
[0:46:46] Unknown: I'm at, thoughts still arise.
[0:46:50] SPEAKER_01: Thoughts are always going to rise plenty, but the ones that get sticky, they get their little
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_01: hooks into me and start to feel, I start to not feel good.
[0:46:57] SPEAKER_01: I start to feel weighed down.
[0:46:58] SPEAKER_01: I start to notice my body contracting maybe in familiar patterns or new patterns.
[0:47:04] SPEAKER_01: I feel sick.
[0:47:05] SPEAKER_01: I feel anxious.
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_01: My nervous system is dysregulated.
[0:47:10] SPEAKER_01: I can have demo day with Byron Katie's work anytime I want to, which is a wonderful thing to have.
[0:47:15] SPEAKER_00: Makes me think about Pema Chodron used to call it Shempa, the sticky quality that there's some
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_00: thoughts that are just like Velcro.
[0:47:23] SPEAKER_00: Like other thoughts, you can see them, you could be like, that's not true.
[0:47:27] SPEAKER_00: And like, I'm going to turn my attention to what I'm grateful for.
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_00: But there's some that have a lot of Shempa.
[0:47:33] SPEAKER_00: I think the two things I would want to bring into this part is one thing I found interesting
[0:47:40] SPEAKER_00: is that the more regulated my nervous system is, the less I have those kinds of painful
[0:47:47] SPEAKER_00: patterned thoughts.
[0:47:48] SPEAKER_00: 100% true.
[0:47:49] SPEAKER_00: And the less I believe them, even if they arise.
[0:47:52] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:47:53] SPEAKER_00: Which doesn't mean that they've been cleared out of my field of conditioning per se,
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_00: but I do think it's really interesting and noteworthy because we identify with our thoughts.
[0:48:03] SPEAKER_00: I mean, even all of you super conscious people, even you and I, Brooke, like if a thought has
[0:48:10] SPEAKER_00: been with you since ever, you know, since you can remember, then when a thought comes like,
[0:48:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm like this, I'm always so tired, or I'm the person who no one likes, like whatever your
[0:48:21] SPEAKER_00: thought is, it feels like identity.
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:48:26] SPEAKER_00: It feels so true.
[0:48:27] SPEAKER_00: And so what's so interesting to notice, and it's so cool when you start experimenting
[0:48:32] SPEAKER_00: with different practices or modalities to calm your nervous system.
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_00: Like, for example, if you don't have a meditation practice, because that's one way,
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_00: but you know, you have to get a meditation practice that gives you a stateship.
[0:48:47] SPEAKER_00: But for example, it's like when you go on vacation, maybe, do you think the same thoughts
[0:48:52] SPEAKER_00: as you think when you're walking through a city street, or if you get a craniosacral
[0:48:56] SPEAKER_00: therapy session, see how many negative thoughts you have right after that.
[0:49:01] SPEAKER_00: Maybe if you don't have the money for those things, listen to Matt Khan on YouTube,
[0:49:06] SPEAKER_00: and really breathe and get into it and see if you have the same level of negative thinking
[0:49:12] SPEAKER_00: right after.
[0:49:14] Unknown: I just think it's interesting and important to note that the more reactive our body is,
[0:49:20] SPEAKER_00: the more activated we are into that survival system, it's going to charge our thoughts.
[0:49:27] SPEAKER_00: And it's funny because sometimes you thought you healed something and then it comes up
[0:49:30] SPEAKER_00: and you're like, oh, no, you know, and it's like, sometimes it's just a matter of like,
[0:49:34] SPEAKER_00: you got into a state of reactivity.
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah, no big deal.
[0:49:39] SPEAKER_00: The other thing I would say, and I think this will lead us into energy is, I noticed sometimes
[0:49:46] SPEAKER_00: with really the deep fundamental belief systems, like the ones that my whole core survival
[0:49:53] SPEAKER_00: strategy are built around, like my codependency is built around, or my sense of self was built
[0:49:58] SPEAKER_00: around.
[0:49:59] Unknown: I noticed I almost had to go on an internal journey back to the moments when they were created.
[0:50:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:50:09] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:50:09] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, for many of us, it is within our family.
[0:50:13] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes it's within school.
[0:50:15] SPEAKER_00: You know, sometimes there's like a specific traumatic event that you can recall, then don't
[0:50:21] SPEAKER_00: do this alone per se.
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_01: Do this with support, especially if you're someone with trauma.
[0:50:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:50:26] SPEAKER_00: I've recommended it on occasion to clients with like very specific instructions when I
[0:50:31] SPEAKER_00: knew there was no capital T trauma in their life.
[0:50:34] SPEAKER_00: But, you know, just to start, we're just laying some things out here.
[0:50:38] SPEAKER_00: It was like going back in time to the moment when it originated and talking to the little
[0:50:44] SPEAKER_00: girl and helping her have a new belief, right?
[0:50:47] SPEAKER_00: Finally giving her the context she never had, the understanding she needed, you know, that
[0:50:53] SPEAKER_00: it wasn't about her or, you know, whatever the case may be, talking to her.
[0:50:57] SPEAKER_00: And then maybe even with her standing up to the person who created the harm that made
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_00: us believe something bad about ourselves or believe something painful about the world
[0:51:09] SPEAKER_00: around us.
[0:51:10] SPEAKER_00: And that took the way I conceptualize of it anyway, it's like it took the energetic
[0:51:17] SPEAKER_00: charge off of it.
[0:51:18] SPEAKER_00: It was almost like I finally turned to it with enough love, enough attention, enough
[0:51:25] SPEAKER_00: strength and conviction and like to the moment, like the Genesis moment.
[0:51:32] SPEAKER_00: And then it like, then it could finally get metabolized through.
[0:51:37] SPEAKER_00: And those are the moments when you feel like a chunk of conditioning can fall off.
[0:51:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:51:42] SPEAKER_00: Like a chunk.
[0:51:43] SPEAKER_00: And then the light comes in and you're like, what?
[0:51:45] SPEAKER_00: I had that happen in Matt Kahn's event and I didn't have to do anything about going into
[0:51:50] SPEAKER_00: my past for that to happen.
[0:51:51] SPEAKER_00: So it can happen in multiple ways.
[0:51:52] SPEAKER_00: But it's like you're taking energy off it.
[0:51:55] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know exactly what's happening.
[0:51:58] SPEAKER_00: To me, that's got to be at the energetic level.
[0:52:00] SPEAKER_00: This is fairly new for me, like last six months that I've been able to do some of this
[0:52:04] SPEAKER_00: work.
[0:52:05] SPEAKER_00: And what I see is it's like rapid accelerated healing, like chunks of how you viewed yourself
[0:52:13] SPEAKER_00: or others just falling away, but really falling away.
[0:52:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:52:18] SPEAKER_00: Like the sponsoring thought stops coming back.
[0:52:20] SPEAKER_00: So to me, if it can happen that fast, it has to be happening at the level of energy.
[0:52:26] SPEAKER_00: So shall we move to?
[0:52:27] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:52:28] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:52:28] SPEAKER_00: And just one last thing I want to say is, so this is the area that even though I did
[0:52:34] SPEAKER_00: energy medicine, when you look at it in terms of transformation of conditioning and unnecessary
[0:52:39] SPEAKER_00: suffering, it's still probably the area of least explored, right?
[0:52:43] Unknown: Like the area I'm still learning more about and integrating.
[0:52:47] SPEAKER_00: But something that really got Brooke and I back on the energy train not too long ago,
[0:52:52] SPEAKER_00: this is preceding our interview with Jill Blakeway, but was I was reading about Dr.
[0:52:57] SPEAKER_00: Sue Mordor and she was saying, well, everybody's paying attention to the nervous system.
[0:53:02] SPEAKER_00: The nervous system, but it's the energetic template that's holding the reactivities
[0:53:08] SPEAKER_00: in the nervous system going.
[0:53:11] SPEAKER_00: And just perhaps it's the energetic template holding the constrictions going and the belief
[0:53:16] SPEAKER_00: systems in place.
[0:53:18] SPEAKER_00: And that took us down this wild adventure.
[0:53:22] SPEAKER_01: Indeed.
[0:53:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:53:23] SPEAKER_01: And I've experienced with energy work that something can go very rapidly, which isn't
[0:53:30] SPEAKER_01: to say that it doesn't also go rapidly with body work or work on thought forms.
[0:53:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:53:35] SPEAKER_00: Or realizations and talks that are pretty short.
[0:53:38] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:53:38] Unknown: But I think it's important to bring in because, I mean, this is something that just doesn't
[0:53:43] SPEAKER_01: get brought to the foreground that much.
[0:53:46] SPEAKER_01: And so it can be really helpful to bring it forward and that we're not trying to have
[0:53:50] Unknown: this conversation in a way that feels laborious because if we come from a perspective, which all
[0:53:57] SPEAKER_01: of us were spoon fed from birth, that we are separate cells who need to work really hard
[0:54:04] Unknown: to make things happen, then we'll take this on in the same way.
[0:54:08] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:54:08] SPEAKER_01: And then it starts to feel laborious.
[0:54:09] SPEAKER_01: Like I'd better make sure that I take care of the body part and the nervous system and
[0:54:13] SPEAKER_01: the tissues and the mind and the thought form.
[0:54:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:54:16] SPEAKER_01: And I barely have the time to take a breath.
[0:54:18] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, oh my God, I have to do all of these things.
[0:54:21] SPEAKER_01: So we're not trying to say you had better really burden yourself with a ton of healing
[0:54:26] SPEAKER_01: or self care work.
[0:54:27] SPEAKER_01: It's actually more, you know, a deep, deep tracking of an experience for you and I out
[0:54:35] SPEAKER_01: of love for ourselves and out of love and hope for the world of like, how does this
[0:54:40] SPEAKER_01: go most easily?
[0:54:42] SPEAKER_01: Not what are the best assignments everyone can have, but like, what is the most easeful,
[0:54:47] SPEAKER_01: most loving, most effortless, most tender way where we can invite more flow into our
[0:54:54] SPEAKER_01: lives, into our healing processes.
[0:54:58] SPEAKER_01: And energy work is one of the ones that has for me for a long time.
[0:55:01] Unknown: In fact, I remember doing energy work in my early 20s when there was a health crisis that
[0:55:07] SPEAKER_01: kind of got this whole party started.
[0:55:10] SPEAKER_01: And I did it because, and back then I was very much like, I'm broke.
[0:55:16] SPEAKER_01: I have a problem.
[0:55:17] SPEAKER_01: This is my problem.
[0:55:19] SPEAKER_01: And I was still, didn't even realize, would never have identified as somebody who needed
[0:55:24] SPEAKER_01: to deal with her PTSD, even though I was living it out at that time.
[0:55:29] SPEAKER_01: I was still actively having flashbacks and that kind of thing.
[0:55:34] SPEAKER_01: I still wouldn't have, if someone had been like, are you a person with trauma?
[0:55:37] SPEAKER_01: I would have just been like, I wouldn't have understood really what they meant.
[0:55:40] SPEAKER_01: So not the highest level of consciousness at that point.
[0:55:43] SPEAKER_01: That's what that crisis was for.
[0:55:45] SPEAKER_01: So I wasn't doing energy work because I lived in a community that was super into new age
[0:55:52] SPEAKER_01: things or because I had a bunch of extra time and money on my hands.
[0:55:57] SPEAKER_01: It was because, well, first of all, I don't know why I wound up in her office in the first
[0:56:00] SPEAKER_01: place.
[0:56:00] Unknown: Of course, it was one of those crazy coincidental things that I'm in this tiny town in Massachusetts
[0:56:06] SPEAKER_01: that I grew up in where there was like a population of 2000.
[0:56:09] SPEAKER_01: This random woman down the street wound up being this energy worker.
[0:56:12] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how we connected and I did a bunch of work with her, but I kept going because
[0:56:18] SPEAKER_01: things would turn on a dime.
[0:56:20] Unknown: Like I would just change.
[0:56:23] SPEAKER_01: It was so palpable.
[0:56:24] SPEAKER_01: I felt different in life.
[0:56:26] SPEAKER_01: I felt less neurotic.
[0:56:28] SPEAKER_01: I felt less scared.
[0:56:29] Unknown: I felt more worthy and my health really changed and things came to me in the same way that
[0:56:37] SPEAKER_01: this particular woman, this energy healer had come to me that were the best possible
[0:56:42] SPEAKER_01: resources or insights.
[0:56:44] SPEAKER_01: It's the way I got myself to Rolfing at this time.
[0:56:47] SPEAKER_01: All this kind of what we can call flow or what we can call downloads where suddenly
[0:56:53] SPEAKER_01: it's not just me, the separate self who's working really hard, but I'm partnering with
[0:56:59] Unknown: something and in truth discovering that I am that something so that I can just connect
[0:57:08] SPEAKER_01: more spontaneously with life and have an experience that's more unbound.
[0:57:14] SPEAKER_01: And so yeah, that's been with me for a long time, but not in the sense that I never went
[0:57:20] SPEAKER_01: on to study energy work.
[0:57:22] SPEAKER_01: I receive a lot of things that I would put under the category of energy work, acupuncture,
[0:57:26] SPEAKER_01: craniosacral.
[0:57:27] SPEAKER_01: I receive actual energy healing sessions.
[0:57:29] Unknown: I've found in this process that's been cataloged here on Bliss and Grit that Kristen Kirk,
[0:57:35] SPEAKER_01: getting long distance healings from her, very helpful.
[0:57:38] SPEAKER_01: So even though it's new and I can't pin it down from a place of authority, right?
[0:57:43] SPEAKER_01: Here's why, especially in a world that doesn't bring it forward that much, even though we know
[0:57:48] SPEAKER_01: scientifically we can talk about everything as energy.
[0:57:50] SPEAKER_01: We don't bring it forward as a part of the normative part of human experience.
[0:57:56] SPEAKER_01: It's really exciting and important to bring it forward, which is why I'm glad we got to
[0:58:00] SPEAKER_01: talk to Jill Blakeway.
[0:58:03] SPEAKER_01: But that there is this something else.
[0:58:06] SPEAKER_01: There is this other way that we can unbind constrictions and that that, I've already said
[0:58:11] SPEAKER_01: it, but just to underscore it.
[0:58:12] SPEAKER_01: One of the reasons why I appreciate that so much is because it starts to touch into
[0:58:18] SPEAKER_01: this place other than the world of form where everything's hard or laborious or it's on me
[0:58:24] SPEAKER_01: or it's going to take time.
[0:58:26] SPEAKER_01: And it has a little bit more of a magical quality.
[0:58:30] Unknown: Yeah, it starts to let you get in touch with, you know, you're more than you think you are,
[0:58:34] SPEAKER_00: right?
[0:58:34] SPEAKER_00: There's something else and all of us can feel energy in our body, which is really cool.
[0:58:39] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you can just bring your attention to your hands right now and inhabit them with
[0:58:44] SPEAKER_00: your mind's energy and you will feel attention.
[0:58:47] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you will feel energy like that's it.
[0:58:50] SPEAKER_00: So I think with energy, I mean, I was a Chinese medicine doctor, right?
[0:58:54] Unknown: So I was working with energy all of the time, but I hadn't seen things like belief systems
[0:59:00] SPEAKER_00: change with it.
[0:59:00] SPEAKER_00: And the same when I got energy work, man, what I did see was like the first time I ever got
[0:59:05] SPEAKER_00: reiki, I saw how much stuff in my childhood had affected me in ways that I didn't cognitively
[0:59:12] SPEAKER_00: understand yet.
[0:59:13] SPEAKER_00: Like, I mean, I, you feel it in your body parts.
[0:59:16] SPEAKER_00: My ears were like holding the screens of my father.
[0:59:19] SPEAKER_00: It was like crazy how it's like right there in your tissues, right?
[0:59:25] SPEAKER_00: These kind of memories were being stored, but she wasn't touching me.
[0:59:28] SPEAKER_00: She was only working on the energy level.
[0:59:29] SPEAKER_00: So whatever that is.
[0:59:31] SPEAKER_00: But when we began to practice somatic meditation first with Reggie and then with Judith Blackstone,
[0:59:40] SPEAKER_00: you start to realize like energetic patterns, right?
[0:59:44] SPEAKER_00: That there are patterns you develop for protection.
[0:59:49] SPEAKER_00: You condense your energy.
[0:59:51] SPEAKER_00: You dissipate your energy.
[0:59:53] SPEAKER_00: You bring all of, you know, another way of saying bring your awareness to your head is
[0:59:58] SPEAKER_00: bring all your energy to your head.
[1:00:01] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[1:00:01] SPEAKER_00: So there's this energetic blueprint at play as well.
[1:00:05] SPEAKER_00: And I mean, this is stuff that they were talking about probably in like Chinese medicine
[1:00:10] Unknown: and Ayurveda in, what am I trying to think of the cosmology?
[1:00:18] SPEAKER_00: Oh, anyway, of all sorts of spiritual traditions, they understood like the doshas.
[1:00:22] SPEAKER_00: That's the tradition I'm just basing right now on the name of.
[1:00:26] SPEAKER_00: But when you look at the at the doshas, you see like there's the energetic level.
[1:00:31] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[1:00:31] SPEAKER_00: There's always been talk of this, but in healing, like this is the point of us having this
[1:00:36] Unknown: conversation is we realize that people aren't bringing it all together all of the time.
[1:00:43] SPEAKER_00: And this energetic patterning is a really interesting bit to understand,
[1:00:51] SPEAKER_00: especially for empathic sensitive people.
[1:00:54] SPEAKER_00: But even if you're not, let's say you feel really dense in your body.
[1:00:58] SPEAKER_00: Let's say you feel super earthbound, like this is all it is.
[1:01:02] SPEAKER_00: I'm just a body and then my body dies and then I'm rotting.
[1:01:05] SPEAKER_00: And that's all.
[1:01:06] Unknown: Like if you feel really, really dense like that, just to begin to experience that level
[1:01:12] SPEAKER_00: of energy opens you up to your potentiality.
[1:01:16] SPEAKER_00: And I mean, that's our hope.
[1:01:18] SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't know, depending on our life, depending on maybe our past lives, maybe our
[1:01:24] SPEAKER_00: karma, maybe our circumstances, our traumas, our temperament, depending on all of that,
[1:01:32] SPEAKER_00: maybe we all have a different potentiality.
[1:01:34] SPEAKER_00: I don't really know.
[1:01:35] SPEAKER_00: But what I know is we can all have more space.
[1:01:40] SPEAKER_00: We can all have less suffering.
[1:01:42] SPEAKER_00: We can all love ourselves more.
[1:01:45] SPEAKER_00: We could all know our own goodness.
[1:01:47] SPEAKER_00: We can all relate to people in a different way.
[1:01:51] SPEAKER_00: We can all flow more.
[1:01:53] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[1:01:54] SPEAKER_00: We can all trust more.
[1:01:55] SPEAKER_00: These things are available.
[1:01:57] SPEAKER_00: It's the human lineage.
[1:01:59] SPEAKER_00: It's part of our human potential, really.
[1:02:03] SPEAKER_00: And I'm just excited to get even more into the study of how looking at this energetic
[1:02:08] SPEAKER_00: piece can change transformation.
[1:02:11] Unknown: Because when we did Judith Blackstone's training, she's mostly bringing you to the more subtle
[1:02:19] SPEAKER_00: level of experience that she calls fundamental consciousness, which is oneness, which quite
[1:02:24] SPEAKER_00: frankly feels like you're feeling the quantum level.
[1:02:27] SPEAKER_00: It's like the subtlest level.
[1:02:31] SPEAKER_00: But you still also feel energy.
[1:02:33] SPEAKER_00: And you feel as if the energy is being called back into the core of your body, into your
[1:02:38] SPEAKER_00: central channel.
[1:02:39] SPEAKER_00: And when that happened, I felt whole.
[1:02:44] SPEAKER_00: That's a tremendous feeling.
[1:02:45] SPEAKER_00: Most of my life, I felt scattered.
[1:02:47] SPEAKER_00: I felt fake.
[1:02:48] SPEAKER_00: I felt like I was missing something.
[1:02:50] SPEAKER_00: I felt incomplete.
[1:02:52] SPEAKER_00: Those words are used for a certain reason.
[1:02:54] Unknown: It's like I don't feel in my core.
[1:02:59] SPEAKER_00: I don't feel whole.
[1:03:00] SPEAKER_00: I don't feel complete.
[1:03:02] SPEAKER_00: And man, energy level.
[1:03:04] SPEAKER_00: Had we not done Reggie's stuff or Judith's stuff, I don't know that I would have experienced
[1:03:10] SPEAKER_00: that this kind of wholeness was right there for us all along.
[1:03:17] SPEAKER_00: Right there.
[1:03:19] SPEAKER_01: And that we really want to make sure that we're having this conversation as a matter
[1:03:25] SPEAKER_01: of potential.
[1:03:25] Unknown: Because if we're saying there's all this conditioning and conditioning stores in us
[1:03:33] SPEAKER_01: in these ways, and we don't need to believe we are it, so we don't need to be just our
[1:03:39] SPEAKER_01: protective personality, just our ego, great.
[1:03:43] SPEAKER_01: But it's really important to include in that conversation.
[1:03:46] SPEAKER_01: Well, if we're not that, then what are we?
[1:03:50] SPEAKER_01: And I remember our conversation with Locke Kelly being such a game changer for that because
[1:03:54] SPEAKER_01: he was talking about, don't just teach people to go to emptiness in meditation.
[1:03:58] SPEAKER_01: There has to be this engaging with the there's something else here, something else here that
[1:04:04] SPEAKER_01: partners with a human life.
[1:04:07] Unknown: And this is where we're getting to human potential.
[1:04:11] SPEAKER_01: It's really exciting.
[1:04:12] SPEAKER_01: What does it mean?
[1:04:13] SPEAKER_01: If you're not your protective personality, if you get a chance to
[1:04:16] Unknown: experience life through a different lens, a different orientation, what does that look
[1:04:22] SPEAKER_01: like?
[1:04:23] Unknown: And you and I are in it on that.
[1:04:26] SPEAKER_01: So we'll keep reporting from the field.
[1:04:29] SPEAKER_01: No pun intended.
[1:04:31] Unknown: But it's a process of getting more free and being able to really, really engage with this
[1:04:40] SPEAKER_01: human life.
[1:04:41] SPEAKER_01: Whatever this one is here for, both in terms of just enjoyment of the basic moment and
[1:04:47] Unknown: whatever is a part of my life, but also what are the things that come from source that
[1:04:54] SPEAKER_01: are my heart desires?
[1:04:55] SPEAKER_01: What is what is this one's mission?
[1:04:58] SPEAKER_01: This one's calling.
[1:05:01] SPEAKER_01: What is this one's heart desire to do so that I can live from more of a flow state, that
[1:05:06] SPEAKER_01: I can live more from intuition and that it is always partnered with my humanity because
[1:05:12] SPEAKER_01: that's what we're doing.
[1:05:13] SPEAKER_00: We do seem to be in bodies touching bodies on earth.
[1:05:18] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[1:05:19] Unknown: Yeah.
[1:05:19] SPEAKER_00: It's like I was telling you the other day, Brooke, lately when I'm talking to my clients,
[1:05:23] SPEAKER_00: they seem to notice I'm using the word the spontaneous self.
[1:05:27] SPEAKER_00: And it's just another way of saying it, right?
[1:05:30] SPEAKER_00: Because if you haven't experienced wholeness or you haven't experienced a chunk of
[1:05:34] SPEAKER_00: conditioning falling out of your body, it's like, what is it that I'm aiming at?
[1:05:38] SPEAKER_00: What's the aspiration that I'm looking at?
[1:05:41] SPEAKER_00: And I think most of us can relate to having thoughts where we're editing ourselves or
[1:05:46] SPEAKER_00: we're analyzing ourselves.
[1:05:47] SPEAKER_00: We're taking our temperature.
[1:05:49] SPEAKER_00: Am I doing a good job?
[1:05:50] SPEAKER_00: Am I doing a bad job?
[1:05:51] SPEAKER_00: Do people like me?
[1:05:52] SPEAKER_00: Don't they like me?
[1:05:53] SPEAKER_00: Should I be more like this?
[1:05:54] SPEAKER_00: Should I be more like that?
[1:05:55] SPEAKER_00: Should I do this more?
[1:05:56] SPEAKER_00: Do that more?
[1:05:58] SPEAKER_00: Most of us can relate to that.
[1:06:00] SPEAKER_00: And what my hope and hypothesis is, what it sounds like when you speak to people who have
[1:06:05] Unknown: a really awake life is you get to just be.
[1:06:11] SPEAKER_00: That's what we're talking about, right?
[1:06:12] SPEAKER_00: It's this spontaneous but present level of engagement, which of course is very different
[1:06:18] SPEAKER_00: than impulsive and reactive, right?
[1:06:21] SPEAKER_00: Driven by our conditioning.
[1:06:23] SPEAKER_00: But that always sounded so lovely to me, like the end of management,
[1:06:28] SPEAKER_00: the end of analysis, the end of second guessing or shitting yourselves.
[1:06:34] SPEAKER_00: Like, wow, how's that for human potential?
[1:06:38] SPEAKER_00: Yes, please.
[1:06:39] SPEAKER_01: And that it's not a part of this kind of high vibe thought form because what we're talking
[1:06:43] SPEAKER_01: about for us, like our code word is that where you have this inquiry is, is heaven here?
[1:06:49] SPEAKER_01: Is it possible to bring more heaven here?
[1:06:51] SPEAKER_01: And that usually gets bound up in this kind of high vibe culture.
[1:06:55] SPEAKER_01: I think about some story, I can't remember which Buddhist lineage, but of a teacher who,
[1:07:01] SPEAKER_01: his wife died and he was crying and his students came over to him and said,
[1:07:04] SPEAKER_01: why are you crying?
[1:07:05] SPEAKER_01: And he said, because my wife died.
[1:07:09] SPEAKER_01: And I'm sad.
[1:07:10] SPEAKER_01: So even at this level, we're operating more from the spontaneous nature, the self-sow,
[1:07:16] SPEAKER_01: that we also have gratitude to be able to experience things like grief in its pure form,
[1:07:23] SPEAKER_01: the pureness of grief is really a form of love, deep, deep, profound love.
[1:07:30] SPEAKER_01: So it's not a problem.
[1:07:32] Unknown: It's not like we're never going to experience some of these emotions.
[1:07:37] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's not like we're never going to be afraid or never protect herself.
[1:07:40] SPEAKER_00: Although Byron Katie seems to say she's never afraid, but,
[1:07:43] SPEAKER_00: you know, by and large, if something's threatening your life,
[1:07:47] SPEAKER_00: you know, you probably want your nervous system to respond and jump out of the way, no?
[1:07:52] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[1:07:55] SPEAKER_01: She's the one who came to the little town of Footloose called Planet Earth.
[1:07:59] SPEAKER_01: It can be like, huh, someone can pull a gun on you and you hug them.
[1:08:02] SPEAKER_01: Interesting.
[1:08:03] SPEAKER_01: Interesting.
[1:08:04] SPEAKER_01: Me, not so much.
[1:08:04] SPEAKER_00: That's a Byron Katie story.
[1:08:06] SPEAKER_01: Byron Katie story, but good to know.
[1:08:08] SPEAKER_01: Thanks for demonstrating that on the Earthly plane.
[1:08:10] SPEAKER_01: It's nice to have aspirational.
[1:08:12] SPEAKER_01: Potential of what a human life could even look like.
[1:08:16] SPEAKER_01: And I'm not going to hold myself to that standard.
[1:08:20] SPEAKER_01: It's whatever's actually useful, evocative or true for me.
[1:08:24] SPEAKER_00: Right. I think the last thing I want to say is that
[1:08:27] SPEAKER_00: what we've seen is transformation does have something to do with capacity, right?
[1:08:33] SPEAKER_00: Like there's the capacity of the nervous system to be present.
[1:08:37] SPEAKER_00: There's the capacity of the mind to have attention.
[1:08:40] SPEAKER_00: You know, sometimes we can't even have the attention
[1:08:44] SPEAKER_00: span to meditate or the attention to be aware of things.
[1:08:50] SPEAKER_00: So there's the capacity for that.
[1:08:52] SPEAKER_00: There's the capacity to experience emotion and the depth and breadth of
[1:08:56] SPEAKER_00: the stored emotion you may have in your body.
[1:09:00] SPEAKER_00: So that ebbs and flows depending on our day, depending on our circumstance,
[1:09:05] SPEAKER_00: depending on our sleep at night, depending on what we eat.
[1:09:08] Unknown: All of these things can change.
[1:09:11] Unknown: And so really, we can be very kind.
[1:09:15] SPEAKER_00: We can be very compassionate about our process.
[1:09:19] SPEAKER_00: We lay this out like this.
[1:09:21] SPEAKER_00: I mean, this stuff has all been developed over 20 years.
[1:09:25] SPEAKER_00: Granted, Brooke and I have been on a fast track with it for the last three or four.
[1:09:30] SPEAKER_00: I can't remember how long it's been now.
[1:09:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1:09:31] SPEAKER_00: Three or four years when we started finding embodied meditation,
[1:09:34] Unknown: that was kind of a real like market point for Brooke and I both.
[1:09:40] SPEAKER_00: But we're coming at it from like, yeah, a long span.
[1:09:47] SPEAKER_00: Come at it from your level.
[1:09:49] SPEAKER_00: This is our experimentation.
[1:09:51] SPEAKER_00: It's our interest.
[1:09:53] SPEAKER_00: It's our curiosity and our working hypothesis.
[1:09:57] Unknown: But you don't, as Brooke said earlier, have to fix all of these levels or else
[1:10:02] SPEAKER_00: I'll never have my human potential.
[1:10:04] SPEAKER_00: I think one of the things we all hope for, and maybe it's the first thing to develop,
[1:10:09] SPEAKER_00: is a little loving kindness with ourselves and a little understanding
[1:10:13] SPEAKER_00: and compassion about the human journey.
[1:10:16] SPEAKER_00: Because from my experience and from what I can see out there,
[1:10:19] SPEAKER_00: and I'm one of the more privileged people in this world,
[1:10:23] Unknown: globally speaking especially, what I can tell is it's not that easy.
[1:10:30] SPEAKER_00: It's very hard to be a human.
[1:10:32] SPEAKER_00: At large, the human species seems to be a traumatized species.
[1:10:36] SPEAKER_00: And it's probably been that way now for thousands of years.
[1:10:39] SPEAKER_00: And so we arrive with all this like God potential, let's say all of this God seed within us.
[1:10:47] SPEAKER_00: But right away, we're carrying lineages worth of trauma.
[1:10:51] SPEAKER_00: We are in family systems that don't know how to regulate.
[1:10:54] SPEAKER_00: We are surrounded by people that are deeply asleep and ignorant and harmful sometimes.
[1:11:00] SPEAKER_00: It's not that easy.
[1:11:02] SPEAKER_00: So we have to develop a lot of compassion and loving kindness and understanding about
[1:11:08] SPEAKER_00: the predicament, right?
[1:11:09] SPEAKER_00: And then understanding about the game we're playing like,
[1:11:12] SPEAKER_00: okay, well, sometimes things can feel tough, but how can I get a little more space?
[1:11:17] SPEAKER_00: Is there a little bit more freedom I can have so that I am suffering less?
[1:11:22] SPEAKER_00: Is there a way that I might be bringing the past into this moment
[1:11:26] SPEAKER_00: and seeing through a perspective that's creating greater suffering?
[1:11:29] SPEAKER_00: And if you want to start, just pick an area, experiment like, geez,
[1:11:34] SPEAKER_00: I really seem to be plagued by my thoughts.
[1:11:37] SPEAKER_00: Cool.
[1:11:38] SPEAKER_00: You know what?
[1:11:38] SPEAKER_00: Byron Katie has the worksheet that Brooke kept referencing free on her website.
[1:11:44] SPEAKER_01: And there's a free help line.
[1:11:46] SPEAKER_01: You can do the work one on one if you want to guide.
[1:11:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1:11:49] SPEAKER_00: And just give it a try.
[1:11:50] SPEAKER_00: Or if you're like, you know, you're listening and you're like,
[1:11:53] SPEAKER_00: I have done years of talk therapy.
[1:11:55] SPEAKER_00: I've looked at my thoughts.
[1:11:57] SPEAKER_00: I've looked at my beliefs.
[1:11:58] SPEAKER_00: But you know what I've never tried?
[1:12:00] SPEAKER_00: I've never tried to be present in my body.
[1:12:03] SPEAKER_00: I've never looked at my nervous system.
[1:12:06] SPEAKER_00: You know, like start where you start and then experiment.
[1:12:08] SPEAKER_00: Does it feel good?
[1:12:09] SPEAKER_00: Does it feel right?
[1:12:11] SPEAKER_00: Is shame coming up?
[1:12:12] SPEAKER_00: Do you have the right support?
[1:12:14] Unknown: If shame's coming up, maybe take a different direction.
[1:12:18] SPEAKER_00: You know, the capacity may not be there for that yet.
[1:12:21] SPEAKER_00: Let's start with something more fundamental, right?
[1:12:24] SPEAKER_00: It's something that I think the dilemma in our culture
[1:12:28] SPEAKER_00: and it's really innocent because we all just want to feel better than we feel,
[1:12:32] SPEAKER_00: is we want it to be a prescription.
[1:12:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1:12:36] SPEAKER_00: And I get it, man.
[1:12:38] SPEAKER_00: I've been there, right?
[1:12:39] SPEAKER_00: Like we're not preaching from on high, but so far,
[1:12:43] SPEAKER_00: and if I develop a prescription, you all are the first to know.
[1:12:47] SPEAKER_00: I swear.
[1:12:48] SPEAKER_00: But so far, from what I can see in my own personal journey,
[1:12:52] SPEAKER_00: there's a lot of individuality to it.
[1:12:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[1:12:55] SPEAKER_00: A lot of individuality.
[1:12:57] Unknown: And a lot of wonderful resources.
[1:13:03] SPEAKER_01: So if we can be curious.
[1:13:05] SPEAKER_00: Self-empowered.
[1:13:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[1:13:07] SPEAKER_00: Have to become self-empowered around your healing to say like,
[1:13:11] SPEAKER_00: enough of this.
[1:13:12] SPEAKER_00: What can I do?
[1:13:14] SPEAKER_00: And just get curious and start to go wherever you can go.
[1:13:17] SPEAKER_00: Whatever is the easiest thing you can do,
[1:13:19] SPEAKER_00: even if it's five minutes of meditation a day.
[1:13:22] Unknown: Yeah.
[1:13:23] SPEAKER_01: And I'm the one that's going to heal me ultimately.
[1:13:28] Unknown: And so with that curiosity,
[1:13:31] SPEAKER_01: how do different things go when we try them out?
[1:13:34] SPEAKER_01: If I pick a high vibes only path for five years,
[1:13:37] SPEAKER_01: how does that affect my life?
[1:13:39] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[1:13:39] SPEAKER_01: Did it work?
[1:13:40] SPEAKER_01: Are your relationships different?
[1:13:41] SPEAKER_00: Or do you feel different inside?
[1:13:43] SPEAKER_01: Did the old pattern stop showing up?
[1:13:45] Unknown: Yeah.
[1:13:46] SPEAKER_01: And that's an inside out curiosity.
[1:13:48] Unknown: So go nuts, folks.
[1:13:53] Unknown: Thank you so much for being a part of our community and for listening to today's show.

[1:14:23] SPEAKER_01: summer break.
[1:14:24] SPEAKER_01: We'll be airing reruns during that time.
[1:14:26] SPEAKER_01: It was really fun for us to go back and look at some of these conversations,
[1:14:31] SPEAKER_01: bring them forward again.
[1:14:32] SPEAKER_01: We feel so lucky that we're able to have these conversations with the teachers that we really
[1:14:38] SPEAKER_01: admire and that we're able to explore these kinds of inquiries together.
[1:14:42] SPEAKER_01: It was fun to go back and remember some of these moments
[1:14:46] SPEAKER_01: were huge parts of our own transformation just being able to have these conversations.
