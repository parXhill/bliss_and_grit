[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_01: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about being
[0:00:17] Unknown: on the embodied spiritual path. What does that actually mean? What is a real evolution
[0:00:23] SPEAKER_01: of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the
[0:00:29] SPEAKER_01: joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. This week's episode is about
[0:00:35] SPEAKER_01: positivity and wow, do we have a lot to say. So it's actually a little longer than usual. After
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_01: reading a question from a listener who was exploring the merits of being a quote unquote
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_01: positive person versus embodying a state of authenticity, we got deeply curious. Given that
[0:00:56] SPEAKER_01: many spiritual teachers and traditions and even modern neuroscience point us towards the wellness
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_01: benefits of positive states, should we focus our attention on bringing what uplifts us forward?
[0:01:10] SPEAKER_01: This conversation feels especially timely to us as we enter the holiday season, which can be a
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_01: time full of high expectations about how happy and grateful we should be. We went to town exploring
[0:01:24] SPEAKER_01: this topic, covering heavy hitting questions like what happens when the idea that we should be
[0:01:30] SPEAKER_01: positive actually evokes states of shame that inhibit presence and healing? What is the soil
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_01: for genuine positivity? Can our attachment to being happy decrease our ability to be genuinely
[0:01:44] SPEAKER_01: positive? If we shift away from always trying to be the positive people, well then how do we show
[0:01:51] SPEAKER_01: up authentically in relationship with others without adding more stress to the mix? We even
[0:01:57] SPEAKER_01: tie the episode off with a holiday bow by throwing in some of our tools on how to relate authentically,
[0:02:04] Unknown: even when you're in a trauma vortex. If you're enjoying the show, we're so appreciative if you
[0:02:12] SPEAKER_01: leave a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. You can also head over to
[0:02:19] SPEAKER_01: blissandgrit.com and subscribe to get our weekly digest of the resources we're currently loving.
[0:02:24] SPEAKER_01: We do have some new community experiences coming up in January as well, so now's a good time to
[0:02:30] SPEAKER_01: get on the newsletter so that you can be updated. One last thing before we head into the conversation,
[0:02:37] SPEAKER_01: if you're new to the show, is that Brooke and I sometimes can curse, so if you're in mixed company,
[0:02:43] Unknown: you may want to pop some headphones in. Okay, here we go. Hello, darling Brooke. Hello, darling
[0:02:56] SPEAKER_01: Vanessa. Well, we have what feels like a juicy conversation today. I'm gonna be really interested
[0:03:04] Unknown: to see where this goes. As usual, we have no idea. No idea. So we had somebody write us a note
[0:03:13] Unknown: with what seems like a really interesting question for both of us, but also perhaps aptly timed since
[0:03:21] Unknown: we are entering into a holiday season for many of us, which means a time of year where not only will
[0:03:30] SPEAKER_01: we be around a lot of loved ones, family, friends, co-workers, but we'll also have a lot of expectations
[0:03:39] SPEAKER_01: around how we hope to feel and what we want to bring to the world. So let me just read this
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_01: beautiful question that one of our listeners sent in and we'll kick off the conversation. Sound good?
[0:03:53] SPEAKER_01: Okay. Recently, I've been working with a question around positivity, spirituality, and psychology.
[0:04:01] SPEAKER_01: I'm someone who has grown up with the idea that if you can stay positive, you'll lead a happier
[0:04:06] SPEAKER_01: life and one that impacts others positively as well. I'm also someone who's received praise for
[0:04:12] Unknown: my whole life for being the positive one, for always smiling and all those kinds of things.
[0:04:19] SPEAKER_01: And this makes me feel good. Also, I recognize that I myself like to be around positive people,
[0:04:26] SPEAKER_01: so shouldn't I want to be that too? I definitely know and can recognize that having a positive
[0:04:32] SPEAKER_01: mindset, looking for silver linings, showing gratitude are all beneficial and healthy practices.
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_01: However, recently I've been feeling a call to be more authentic to how I'm really feeling,
[0:04:45] Unknown: to show anger when I feel anger, to be sad when I am sad, to hide those harder emotions less and
[0:04:53] SPEAKER_01: be more true to what I'm feeling, to answer more honestly when a friend asks me how I am.
[0:04:58] SPEAKER_01: It sometimes feels exhausting to be the positive person and the hiding of the harder feelings like
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_01: anger, sadness, and fear seems to sometimes come from a place of shame and I am done with that.
[0:05:10] SPEAKER_01: In the spiritual world, this showing of harder emotions, especially anger, seems to be somewhat
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_01: discouraged. I'm confused about how to balance the real need to be genuine about how I feel out in
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_01: the world with the other voices that tell me to be positive and stay positive. What do you think
[0:05:30] SPEAKER_00: of that? I think there's a great question. Yeah, it's a great question. I'm so glad she wrote it in.
[0:05:36] Unknown: I responded on Facebook and the first thing I said was that it tends to be like answering this
[0:05:44] Unknown: question tends to be at the heart of why we do this show. How do we be fully human, basically?
[0:05:53] Unknown: Why is that such a tricky process it seems to live? Yet, as these things go, typing out a response is
[0:06:05] SPEAKER_00: not exactly the most rich and nuanced way to communicate about something.
[0:06:10] SPEAKER_00: I sent my message to her and I'm so glad we get to do a whole episode on it because you and I talking
[0:06:16] SPEAKER_00: before we got recording, there's so much more to say. Essentially, I had just pointed out the
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_00: ways that she had already answered the question for herself. When you say
[0:06:28] SPEAKER_00: that it's exhausting, then there's a kind of fatiguing role playing going on.
[0:06:36] SPEAKER_00: When you say, I like to be, and I'm using you universally, not just towards this individual
[0:06:42] Unknown: person, for all of us, when we say I like to be around positive people,
[0:06:49] SPEAKER_00: is that true if we're talking about this kind of role playing?
[0:06:58] SPEAKER_00: Yet, being super authentic and always sharing whatever emotion is up can also get
[0:07:05] SPEAKER_00: tricky. Like you were saying, particularly this time of year, we have these desires.
[0:07:10] Unknown: I desire to feel really grateful for everything that I have. I desire to feel really joyful
[0:07:22] SPEAKER_00: with my family and my friends. I desire to really appreciate everything.
[0:07:31] SPEAKER_00: Even if that weren't the case, even if it weren't holiday season and I didn't have these particular
[0:07:35] SPEAKER_00: desires, it isn't so straightforward. Whatever you feel, just express it because so much of
[0:07:46] Unknown: this stuff is an inside job where we get to notice what we're feeling and welcome it and then walk
[0:07:51] SPEAKER_00: that internal journey of what's really up with me, what's really true for me. All of that is to say,
[0:07:58] Unknown: there is a lot to say about this question. I'm trying to think of what the most useful thread
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_00: in all of that to tug might be to get the party started.
[0:08:15] Unknown: I think we could say if we just put a container around it, an umbrella around it,
[0:08:23] SPEAKER_01: and listening to you, there's one part that's the inside path, the inner path. How do we relate to
[0:08:30] SPEAKER_01: ourselves when we're having these different emotions? How do we relate to the emotions,
[0:08:35] SPEAKER_01: to the identities we can face, like people pleaser, that I want to be the good one? How
[0:08:41] SPEAKER_01: do we relate to the expectations we should have on what a good person would be and how grateful we
[0:08:47] Unknown: should be? We have this internal exploration. Then we have this other part, which is how do we be in
[0:08:55] SPEAKER_01: relationship with people? If I am feeling grief-stricken and my friend asks me, how are you?
[0:09:04] SPEAKER_01: When and where do I share that? What is the appropriate time? If I show up at a holiday
[0:09:12] SPEAKER_01: dinner with friends and family and I'm feeling really angry from something that happened in my
[0:09:18] Unknown: adolescence that's unlocking from my psoas, is that the moment that I unveil it, that I am honest
[0:09:25] SPEAKER_01: to it? I think we have these two different aspects that we're all grappling with around it. It's how
[0:09:32] Unknown: do I relate to myself when I'm having these experiences one could label as not positive
[0:09:40] SPEAKER_01: that I don't want to have. Then the second is how and when do I bring that up and out into the
[0:09:47] SPEAKER_00: world? Does that make sense? Yeah, totally. I think that a place to begin to for all of us
[0:09:53] SPEAKER_00: in our own lives is the place that you and I always like to begin, which is giving ourselves
[0:10:01] Unknown: permission to be human beings who have multiple dimensions and ways of being. We have good days
[0:10:12] SPEAKER_00: and bad days and there's just quite a lot more mystery than we ever want to admit about why those
[0:10:16] Unknown: things happen. We can't always pinpoint. We have to begin with permission. Really, that permission
[0:10:28] Unknown: is just permission to notice. Permission to notice I feel sad today or I feel like I'm in a funk or
[0:10:35] SPEAKER_00: I feel tired or I feel that I want to be the positive one. I want to be the grateful one and
[0:10:41] Unknown: I can't because without the permission to even notice that, we wind up digging really fatiguing
[0:10:50] Unknown: holes for ourselves and that means that we can't relate and we don't wind up developing really
[0:10:57] Unknown: meaningful relationships in our lives and connections to others. Yeah, it's so problematic
[0:11:04] Unknown: because we all know how good it feels to be positive, right? When we're in that flow and
[0:11:11] SPEAKER_01: we're optimistic or blissful or grateful or even when we're around people who are in that state
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_01: and we get that contagious bit of energy around them, it can feel so nourishing and rich, but
[0:11:26] Unknown: we've sort of come to this point where we're so biased towards that sensation that we forget
[0:11:34] Unknown: about the necessity and beauty and exquisite-ness of other states of being. We did a whole episode
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_01: on grief and we spoke about how grief is directly in relationship to praise. It's directly in
[0:11:51] Unknown: relationship to love. I mean, I don't want to say grief is what makes us human, but it's such a rich
[0:11:58] SPEAKER_01: part of this human experience that we open our hearts so much even though we know at some point
[0:12:06] Unknown: we're going to lose everything. That's so profound. It's so deep. It's so lovely and we all know these
[0:12:14] SPEAKER_01: moments where we've been in the pits of despair. We've been on our knees. We've experienced broken
[0:12:23] SPEAKER_01: hearts or sadness and all of these emotions that we would somehow deem as less worthy
[0:12:30] Unknown: societally or less welcome, and yet they broke us through. They split us open. They exposed us to a
[0:12:41] Unknown: whole different dimension. I remember when my ex-husband and I first knew that this wasn't
[0:12:50] Unknown: going to work. It was sort of a realization we had that probably preceded our breakup for about a
[0:12:57] Unknown: year or so, but something happened and my heart was just struck with grief. We just knew, you know?
[0:13:06] Unknown: Oh my God, it ached so bad. I'm such a kinesthetic person, so it felt like my breastbone was cracked
[0:13:16] Unknown: open. At that same moment as this really bone-deep aching was happening, I felt so alive. It was like
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_01: I noticed the water differently and the moon differently and the smells differently. I mean,
[0:13:36] SPEAKER_01: I literally can still recall how alive and on I felt, how present I felt. We forget that
[0:13:47] SPEAKER_01: all of these emotions, all of these experiences are part of the human fabric because they're meant
[0:13:53] Unknown: to be. There's something for us within them. They are for us to experience the multi-dimensionality
[0:14:00] Unknown: of this life, to find compassion, to find presence, to be aware. Even within those states,
[0:14:07] Unknown: there can be so much exquisite beauty that it makes you want to just shed a tear for the profundity
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_01: of our lives. I think one of the dilemmas that we face is that both culturally and personally,
[0:14:24] SPEAKER_01: we can have such a bias towards the quote unquote positive emotions that we forget that we add value
[0:14:34] SPEAKER_01: both in our own exploration of life, but to the world through having these other feelings.
[0:14:41] SPEAKER_00: I would even say that our bias culturally towards the positive emotions and being the positive
[0:14:49] Unknown: person has really kind of put a stake in the heart of genuine positivity. We don't experience
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_00: genuine positivity so much because it's the age of the curated self. People are broadcasting
[0:15:05] SPEAKER_00: a performance of positivity because we all got the memo. We got the memo that the good ones
[0:15:11] SPEAKER_00: are positive and optimistic and working on themselves and self-improving and blah.
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_00: We're surrounded because of social media with people who are getting very adept because we're
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_00: all picking up on cues from one another at how to broadcast being the positive one. It's this
[0:15:31] SPEAKER_00: surface layer of fake positivity and genuine positivity is such a beautiful thing, but it's
[0:15:40] Unknown: very deep. It's a very visceral emotion, genuine positivity, genuine joy and delight and love.
[0:15:51] SPEAKER_00: I would even say adoration, where you just move towards something and you're like,
[0:15:56] Unknown: hmm. We don't get as much of it. It's this funny thing. It's like chasing the tiger's tail,
[0:16:04] SPEAKER_00: right? Because we don't get to have the depthful version of real positivity when someone's really
[0:16:13] SPEAKER_00: experiencing it and bringing that to the world instead of performing it, it's like we're hungry
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: for it. We try and perform it harder or be with people who perform it harder and then we can feel
[0:16:28] SPEAKER_00: how it falls short. We can feel how it's empty. The hunger just keeps building. It's a funny thing.
[0:16:38] Unknown: Positivity is a gorgeous thing when it's a genuine emotion, when that's what's true
[0:16:46] SPEAKER_00: in the moment, when that's really coming forward, when it's a role that we're playing
[0:16:50] SPEAKER_00: because we feel like we're supposed to in order to get love, in order to earn our right to exist,
[0:16:59] SPEAKER_00: it's actually this very sad thing. I think we've all had the experience or I would say most of us
[0:17:05] Unknown: have multiple times where we've been around somebody who's trying to cover whatever their
[0:17:13] Unknown: genuine emotion is because they got the memo, their grief, their anger, their sadness, their
[0:17:18] SPEAKER_00: despair is not welcome here in this world and so they're trying to cover it with a veneer
[0:17:23] Unknown: of fake positivity and that's a very unpleasant interaction to have.
[0:17:32] Unknown: Hmm. That was so interesting. That was beautifully said. I remember my dad used to say things like
[0:17:40] SPEAKER_01: when people ask you how you are, they don't really want to know. You just put on a happy face and you
[0:17:46] Unknown: say everything's good kind of a thing. It's such a broken part of our society that of course to
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_01: some degree it's true but it's not coming from a place of health. It's coming from a place where
[0:17:59] Unknown: people feel too weak and incapable to tolerate the genuine depths of human experience, of what it
[0:18:09] SPEAKER_01: means to be human. It's like we were listening to a podcast with Carolyn Mace and she was talking
[0:18:16] SPEAKER_01: about how people don't watch the news and oh boy, did this get her heated, right? She was like on fire
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_01: about this and you know, I really understood it in the moment that she was saying it because she's like
[0:18:29] Unknown: you know, I'm going to paraphrase badly but ultimately we're getting weaker. You know,
[0:18:36] SPEAKER_01: we think that we're getting stronger in our spiritual practices but if we can't even tolerate
[0:18:41] SPEAKER_01: what's happening in the world around us, like it's genuinely happening, we shouldn't have the
[0:18:46] Unknown: capacity to be with it and tolerate it, that's a problem. We're turning away from everything
[0:18:52] Unknown: because it has quote unquote negative vibes or bad vibes but this is a part of the human reality
[0:19:01] SPEAKER_01: in this moment in time and likely always, certainly before and who knows maybe to come.
[0:19:09] SPEAKER_01: And I thought that was very interesting as someone who myself has to be very careful around what I
[0:19:14] SPEAKER_01: expose myself to, less and less, more I do it out of preference than need but I did think it was
[0:19:20] SPEAKER_01: very interesting because even in these simple exchanges, if on Instagram I write a deep post
[0:19:27] Unknown: about some of the physical illness I've been dealing with, it is certainly less popular than
[0:19:33] Unknown: if I'm like I love myself now and give sentence period. I know, forever and ever self-love.
[0:19:41] Unknown: And I get it, you know why? Is because we want hope and that genuine state of positivity you
[0:19:48] SPEAKER_01: are referencing, it seems to be difficult for us humans. I don't know if it's a modern dilemma or
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_01: an always dilemma. I can only speak to what I can observe in myself and in the world around me
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_01: because you know, I'm going to just sort of differentiate even though there is no real
[0:20:06] Unknown: difference but for the sake of conversation, we have positive moments. You know, there's a moment
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_01: where I'm just watching the sunset and I'm moved and how beautiful or I'm listening to a human in
[0:20:20] SPEAKER_01: a emote something that's really true about themselves and I'm touched and there's these
[0:20:25] Unknown: moments where I'm just broken open in gratitude. So there's this kind of moment by moment experience
[0:20:33] Unknown: of these positive states of being. And then there's this deeper way that people can relate to life
[0:20:42] Unknown: that has the genuine positivity as part of it, sort of a genuine relationship to life
[0:20:53] Unknown: that feels easeful, that feels open. And I'm wondering if it feels optimistic and I'm weighing
[0:21:02] SPEAKER_01: it out in my head or not because some people can be very realistic and some people can be ultimately
[0:21:08] SPEAKER_01: optimistic the way let's say a Matt Khan would talk, very optimistic relationship to life.
[0:21:14] SPEAKER_01: So there's these different aspects and to have that genuine relationship, the latter one that
[0:21:20] Unknown: I mentioned where you were just open and in love with the reality of life and this existence in
[0:21:30] Unknown: this universe. We're not taught it. We're often not exposed to it. Many of us are still fumbling
[0:21:39] SPEAKER_01: our way through it as we're so inundated with the stressors and belief systems of the material
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_01: reality that I think we start grasping at that moment to moment positivity. But the moment to
[0:21:55] SPEAKER_01: moment being more of a feeling tone or more of an embodied state, it has a transience to it the
[0:22:01] SPEAKER_01: same way as the weather does, the same way as our body fluctuates and our hormones cycle. There's
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_01: rhythms to it. So if we keep chasing that state as if that state is the ultimate way of being,
[0:22:17] Unknown: of course, we have to start forcing something. We have to start efforting something.
[0:22:24] SPEAKER_01: Dare we say even at some point possibly faking something because it is an unattainable
[0:22:32] Unknown: state if we're speaking towards permanence. It gets me thinking like, well, what is the soil
[0:22:41] Unknown: that positivity grows out of? Like what are the fundamental ingredients for genuine positivity?
[0:22:49] SPEAKER_00: Because I was thinking about that, the same talk you just referenced by Caroline Mase and
[0:22:55] SPEAKER_00: some of the things that she pointed to culturally, right? That we are more
[0:23:01] Unknown: sealed off. We are more individualistic. We contribute less and care less about contributing
[0:23:12] Unknown: to say, you know, civic discourse. Like I don't go to town hall to hear the meetings about
[0:23:21] SPEAKER_00: stuff that's going to affect my actual community. You know, what are they going to do about the new
[0:23:25] SPEAKER_00: middle school building and what are they talking about about the low income housing development?
[0:23:30] SPEAKER_00: What's actually going on? We don't really participate in those things. I feel like in a
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_00: funny way, maybe we look at what are the precursors to genuine positivity and I think they're things
[0:23:40] Unknown: like genuineness for starters, genuine intimacy, connection to one another. All these things that
[0:23:52] SPEAKER_00: our modern lives are really missing. We've developed so many tools that make it easy for us
[0:23:58] Unknown: to be more sealed off. Like I could stay in my house for the next year
[0:24:06] Unknown: and I could have Amazon deliver me everything I need. I could Skype with some people here and
[0:24:11] SPEAKER_00: there so I don't feel lonely. Like it's weird, right? Like never before in human history has
[0:24:16] SPEAKER_00: that even been an option that like food and people would just arrive by what I do on my technology
[0:24:23] SPEAKER_00: and it doesn't require that I have to participate in my community at all. And so I don't get any of
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_00: that like actual humanness, basic things like or even just thinking about the interconnectedness
[0:24:36] SPEAKER_00: of things. Like if you've never bothered to try and I'm kind of going off on a tangent here,
[0:24:41] SPEAKER_00: but like if you think about growing some of your food, you learn a lot about what it takes
[0:24:48] SPEAKER_00: for food to exist. And that if you are going to try and only live off your own food and you live
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_00: in New England like I do, you've got kind of a big task and you have to really think ahead because
[0:25:01] SPEAKER_00: February gets cold, nothing grows, like all this stuff.
[0:25:05] SPEAKER_00: And you would sure be grateful when something did.
[0:25:08] SPEAKER_00: Right. So it's like we don't have the soil for genuine positivity. We don't have the
[0:25:17] SPEAKER_00: for genuine positivity because we don't have the interconnectedness. I feel like maybe that's what
[0:25:21] Unknown: we're dealing with is how easy it is for us to not have a lived experience of our interconnectedness.
[0:25:32] Unknown: This is an interesting thread for me. It makes me think about this documentary I had seen called
[0:25:39] Unknown: The Lost Boys of Sudan. Have you ever seen it? No, I had a friend who worked with that organization
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_01: so I'm very familiar. Yeah, it was a beautiful documentary and it was about refugees and we had
[0:25:52] SPEAKER_01: granted refugee status to a number of people of Sudan and the documentary followed, I believe it
[0:25:57] SPEAKER_01: was five. But one of the things they said that was so interesting, I mean, these men had a chance to
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_01: come to America from refugee camps. So you imagine that being a fairly unpleasant way to live in a
[0:26:09] SPEAKER_01: refugee camp. And they were depressed and desperate to go back. They said this is the
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_01: loneliest society they have ever encountered. They were like, I couldn't even go up to my
[0:26:20] SPEAKER_01: neighbors and ask them for a cup of milk without people wondering why I was wandering up to their
[0:26:27] Unknown: property and what it is I was going to do to them. And I think connection is a really good thing to
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_01: point to because I often think about it as connection to self, like genuine self, deep self,
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_01: connection to others, our friends, our family, our communities, our global people, our world,
[0:26:50] Unknown: our animals, our plants, and connection to life, God, universe, source, energy, light.
[0:26:58] Unknown: And on so many levels, we are disconnected. And wow, this is probably its own topic in and of itself
[0:27:09] SPEAKER_01: of what it means to feel disconnected from our ecosystem. But I think there's a couple things
[0:27:15] Unknown: we can point to one is kind of extraneous, perhaps, but I just it came up with what you were saying,
[0:27:21] Unknown: and I just have to say it. When you were talking about living with the land, I was listening to
[0:27:26] Unknown: a pagan teacher, her name is Starhawk. And she was talking about how she spent many, many years
[0:27:36] SPEAKER_01: just meditating, you know, outside, she'd even meditate on the earth, you know, just sit outside
[0:27:40] SPEAKER_01: and close her eyes and meditate. And then she got this message at one point, like, Hello, you're not
[0:27:46] SPEAKER_01: actually in relationship with the earth, like you're in relationship with the concept of the
[0:27:50] SPEAKER_01: earth that's coming through your meditation. Just sit and watch how Rosemary grows.
[0:27:54] Unknown: Love it. Right? Yeah, I love that.
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_01: Like, word, there's this way there's this way that, especially because of our modern lives,
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_01: we're already disconnected from that, right? So perhaps in more traditional practices,
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_01: you might spend four hours meditating, but you were still going to spend six hours in
[0:28:16] SPEAKER_01: actual relationship with people with animals with plants with the stars with the moon.
[0:28:23] SPEAKER_01: But in our modern lives, where we have so little time for that, it's a beautiful thing to get on
[0:28:28] Unknown: your cushion and be with the stillness. And I'm certainly not saying don't do that. But there's
[0:28:34] SPEAKER_01: this way that we forget that we still need to find a way to be in relationship to the actual
[0:28:38] Unknown: unfolding of aliveness in this world that there's so much to be gained. There's so much that is about
[0:28:47] Unknown: right relationship, you know, there in order to open up these states of being these senses
[0:28:54] Unknown: of genuine positivity. So that's the sort of tangent I want to bring in. But if we were to
[0:29:01] SPEAKER_01: talk about connection as being one of these elements of the soil, and we think about connection
[0:29:06] Unknown: to ourselves and connection to our fellow people, we can see right away how feeling as if we must
[0:29:14] Unknown: have a certain state, a certain state of emotion, in order to maintain connection, we can see how
[0:29:22] Unknown: that is a problem. Because right away, as soon as we experience something different, it puts us out
[0:29:28] Unknown: of connection to ourselves and to others. It's almost like having a misaligned bone. You know,
[0:29:34] SPEAKER_01: we're already now going to create a distortion. And if you have a misaligned bone, and your
[0:29:39] Unknown: skeleton is hiking to the left, you're going to start to form muscle imbalances, you're going to
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: walk differently. And all of these things are going to go out of their proper relationship.
[0:29:52] SPEAKER_01: And I think just starting there, that this cultural and personal desire to forego connection to
[0:30:01] SPEAKER_01: ourselves, and of course, genuine intimacy with others that arises when we're honest and real and
[0:30:07] SPEAKER_01: raw, that that is part of the misalignment that then leads us away from feeling states of genuine
[0:30:15] Unknown: positivity. Then I might be sending us a field, we'll see. It's just like that today. It is just
[0:30:26] SPEAKER_00: like that today. But as I because I'm having the investigation about this, you know, an inquiry
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_00: about this as we talk, and I'm kind of trying to do a little detective work here, like what,
[0:30:37] Unknown: you know, why is it hard to feel genuine positivity, genuine delight,
[0:30:45] SPEAKER_00: genuine gratitude. And we're talking about some of that, like this disconnection,
[0:30:51] SPEAKER_00: modern life enabling that disconnection tremendously. And I feel like if I could point
[0:30:59] Unknown: to the one infection that we could all have some influence over as individuals instead of feeling
[0:31:08] Unknown: impotent about these larger forces, you know, it's the busyness infection, like what you know,
[0:31:16] Unknown: but like we are all so busy. And like we all drank the Kool-Aid of busyness with mother's milk,
[0:31:27] SPEAKER_00: right? And so we all and then we have these complex lives. We have these lives that require
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_00: quite a lot of income to come in for basic needs, which didn't always used to be the case.
[0:31:40] SPEAKER_00: So it's like I'm busy, I'm busy, I'm busy. But then it gets valued culturally, like you're doing a
[0:31:46] Unknown: good job if you seem super busy. And we just lose track of ourselves. And then we're piling
[0:31:52] SPEAKER_00: complexity and complexity and complexity and we're busy and we're busy and busy. If I'm so
[0:31:57] SPEAKER_00: fucking busy getting done what I really truly believe I need to get done in order to survive,
[0:32:05] SPEAKER_00: I can't have an experience of my life. I can't feel gratitude for my gorgeous son sitting next
[0:32:11] SPEAKER_00: to me on the couch, you know, after he just lit the Christmas candles I put out, you know,
[0:32:17] SPEAKER_00: because I'm just like, what's next? What's next? What's next? What's on the to do list?
[0:32:21] SPEAKER_00: And for sure, you know, this has been a pattern for me and continues to be, although much less so.
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_00: But I had it come back recently just because this month is a compressed month, right? And I've got
[0:32:31] SPEAKER_00: family coming to visit this month and my son has to get tonsils out this month. So there's surgery
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_00: and recovery involves. There's like all this extra stuff. And I started feeling the busy infection
[0:32:41] SPEAKER_00: again, which I haven't really actually felt in many months. And I was just like, oh, this feels
[0:32:47] Unknown: awful. And I cannot enjoy my life when I'm believing the busy story. And when we went to
[0:32:55] Unknown: Dharma Ocean, I remember after our first week in Crestone, I don't know whether I got this message
[0:33:01] SPEAKER_00: in my individual group because we were split into smaller groups or if it was something that was
[0:33:06] Unknown: said to all of us by the teachers there, Tammy and Jake, after that first week. But it was like the
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_00: most important thing when you go home in this time period between week one and week two, which
[0:33:20] SPEAKER_00: was five months, the most important thing is simplify your life. I think it was actually a
[0:33:26] SPEAKER_00: part of the curriculum that we got for that five month period in between. And I took that to heart
[0:33:31] SPEAKER_00: and I realized there was a lot that I could cut out of my schedule and my busyness obsession. And
[0:33:38] SPEAKER_00: I am very much conditioned to believe that if I'm busy, I'm a good person, you know, so
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_00: it's challenging for me to spot those places that could go that are over complex and could be
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_00: simpler. And it's been two years now where I just keep emptying out extra things and getting less
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_00: and less busy. And there is a direct relationship between the ability to enjoy your life and the
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_00: amount of busyness that you have. And so if you can go in and harvest out unnecessary busyness
[0:34:12] Unknown: and complexity, which I guarantee you we all have, it starts to change your relationship to your life
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_00: pretty dramatically.
[0:34:22] Unknown: Sure. It makes it way easier and more accessible to be present and not to be exhausted,
[0:34:31] Unknown: quite frankly, so that you can be in simple states of joy. I guess part of what we're pointing at,
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: so through what we're saying, obviously our bias is be human. How you feel is how you feel.
[0:34:45] SPEAKER_01: Don't contort it. Don't distort it. And what we're saying is it's so easy to do that because
[0:34:52] SPEAKER_01: we can have an attachment that that's a good way to be, that that's the healthy way to be,
[0:34:57] Unknown: that that's the successful way to be. We can also have identities built around it,
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_01: like the busy person or the people pleaser or the good one. And so, of course, what we're
[0:35:07] SPEAKER_01: confronting within ourselves, never mind the societal pressure, what we're confronting just
[0:35:13] Unknown: within ourselves is this strong pull to be a certain way in order to be happy, in order to
[0:35:20] SPEAKER_01: be successful, in order to have love. So we can see all of that and you can hear our biases. Don't
[0:35:26] Unknown: do that. That has led us astray. Always has, always will. So then we can start to look at the
[0:35:35] SPEAKER_01: question of like, what do we do? How do we interact with this? So I think some of what
[0:35:41] SPEAKER_01: you were just saying, Brooke, that I want to highlight is part of allowing yourself
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_01: to recognize your genuine experience is because it opens up an investigation.
[0:35:55] SPEAKER_01: Well, genuinely, I have the heartfelt desire to be grateful. I have the heartfelt desire to feel
[0:36:01] SPEAKER_01: joyful. I have the heartfelt desire to have gratitude and love and all of these different
[0:36:07] Unknown: states of being. And I don't. And so then it opens up an investigation. You know, what is inhibiting
[0:36:15] SPEAKER_01: the flow of that? Is it because your life is too busy? Is it because you're exhausted? Is it because
[0:36:22] SPEAKER_01: you're in the wrong relationship, the wrong job? Is it because your inner critic is constantly
[0:36:29] Unknown: hammering at you? You know, is it because you have a sickness that you haven't yet had an
[0:36:35] Unknown: opportunity to address that's creating a hormonal imbalance? As soon as we get real and we get honest
[0:36:43] Unknown: about what's happening, the invitation arises from life to start to see, to see, and then we
[0:36:51] SPEAKER_01: can follow a thread towards these genuine states of positivity that can arise, which again, is not
[0:36:57] SPEAKER_01: static. It's more like bedrock. And then there are these kind of movable states on top of it.
[0:37:06] Unknown: So I think that's part of what's interesting. Now, I think where I get tripped up, and this is
[0:37:11] Unknown: part of why the question intrigued me was, okay, neurobiologically, I know the goodness
[0:37:22] SPEAKER_01: that lies within shifting your brain towards states of being like gratitude and compassion.
[0:37:29] SPEAKER_01: And I always liked those two in particular. You can't just shift towards happiness. To me,
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_01: that's bullshit. Like you're happy or you're not. You can't do that. But you can evoke states of
[0:37:39] SPEAKER_01: compassion just by breathing into your heart. You really can. And you can evoke states of gratitude
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_01: if you just start really simple, like I'm gratitude, I have gratitude that I can breathe.
[0:37:50] SPEAKER_01: Right? So I always understood neurobiologically, there was some benefit to that. And then we can
[0:37:57] SPEAKER_01: see how captivating it can be when you're in psychology or when you're in self-exploration
[0:38:04] SPEAKER_01: to keep spinning around the trauma, to keep focusing on the lack, to focus on what you don't
[0:38:09] SPEAKER_01: have or what you're doing wrong, and to miss the opportunity to just breathe in these simple states
[0:38:16] Unknown: of goodness that are right there and available to us. So recently I was listening to a talk with
[0:38:23] SPEAKER_01: Matt Kahn. I think it was the Alchemy of Transformation is what it was called. And he
[0:38:27] Unknown: was talking about gratitude. And he was just saying, you know, gratitude is ultimately the
[0:38:32] Unknown: alchemical agent. He started with love. Right? So if any of you listen to Matt Kahn, let me just
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_01: break it down just in case, because I think there's an importance in the step-by-step.
[0:38:43] Unknown: He started with whatever arises, love that. So the invitation with that message is,
[0:38:50] Unknown: if grief arises, you turn towards it with love. If sadness arises, you turn towards it with love.
[0:38:55] SPEAKER_01: You don't reject it and judge it and say it should be different and it should be positive.
[0:38:59] SPEAKER_01: So he started there. And then the practice is just get into a state of gratitude. You're going to
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_01: shift your energy. You're going to shift your state of being. You're going to realign with the
[0:39:10] Unknown: universe and then things will flow better. Now I get that. I get that rationally. I get that
[0:39:18] Unknown: neurobiologically. Yet I don't find it so easy in practice without a sort of potential bypass
[0:39:28] SPEAKER_01: happening. But I don't know if now that's part of just my tendency as a sort of depth psychologist,
[0:39:36] SPEAKER_01: spiritual embodied person. So what do you think about all of that?
[0:39:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, as you're describing it, because I haven't listened to that Matt Kahn talk
[0:39:46] Unknown: where he focuses on gratitude. And so for me, it felt like there was a step missed in terms of me
[0:39:53] SPEAKER_00: actually being able to feel it in my own experience. Because first of all, being able to turn towards
[0:39:58] Unknown: whatever arises and love it, big fucking deal. Very uncommon in our world, you know, but I've
[0:40:05] SPEAKER_00: had some time with that, exploring it as a lived experience because I'm familiar with Matt's work
[0:40:12] Unknown: and that's part of what I've been up to this year. So the gratitude piece, like I missed a step
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_00: where I can actually feel it, like you said, conceptually, sure, yes, great.
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, part of what he was even saying is, for example, even if you don't feel grateful at
[0:40:30] SPEAKER_01: the moment, let's say, you know, right now everything's shit and I don't feel grateful,
[0:40:34] SPEAKER_01: you could just move towards I wish I felt grateful. And that even that is a step
[0:40:40] SPEAKER_01: towards shifting. And so go there. Now, we don't even have to focus on Matt Kahn style,
[0:40:46] SPEAKER_01: but just rather this basic fundamental idea we get, you know, societally, some spiritually,
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_01: some neurobiologically that you don't need to focus on the belief systems or the hard stuff
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: or the conditioning, but rather shift your energy, shift your energy and it will shift
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_01: your neurobiology, then you'll be in parasympathetic joy. So what do we say towards that?
[0:41:12] SPEAKER_00: Well, the place that we always get so fucking tripped up in Western culture is is how predisposed
[0:41:17] SPEAKER_00: we are to shame, you know, because as soon as I'm saying I should feel grateful, or I want to feel
[0:41:23] SPEAKER_00: grateful, and we're not like turning towards it with love can soften things quite a bit, but
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_00: it can soften things completely. But if I'm just always trying to shift towards gratitude,
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_00: the wiring of shame, which is so thick in all of us is going to say, what's wrong with me? Why can't
[0:41:43] SPEAKER_00: I feel shame? I should feel a different way than I do. And I really feel like shame is that thing
[0:41:49] SPEAKER_00: that just drags all of us down into the muck and keeps us from ever making any progress. So anything
[0:41:54] SPEAKER_00: that like sets off the shame activation, I'm like, if I actually feel it in myself,
[0:42:01] SPEAKER_00: it's just like, oh, you know, as soon as it's telling me,
[0:42:06] SPEAKER_00: what are you doing wrong? And I'm really differentiating shame from things like remorse,
[0:42:12] SPEAKER_00: guilt, regret, totally different. I'm talking about something completely different.
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_00: Shame is basically, there's something fundamentally wrong with what I am,
[0:42:25] SPEAKER_00: you know, like annihilation levels of fundamental wrongness that we just all have in us so much.
[0:42:32] SPEAKER_00: So as soon as I'm saying like, I should be feeling grateful and I don't,
[0:42:36] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, there's a step missing because it sets me down the shame road. And so I haven't
[0:42:40] Unknown: unhooked in the direction of an actual energetic change to where I'm actually feeling some
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_01: softening, actually feeling some gratitude. Sure. I mean, maybe in a reality where, let's say,
[0:42:56] SPEAKER_01: for example, fear arises and you can turn towards it with genuine love and you can meet it,
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_01: you know, and you can soften then maybe the next step is this easy unfolding of gratitude
[0:43:09] SPEAKER_01: for this moment for life, you know, of course, it could be that it flows like that and it would
[0:43:14] Unknown: make more sense. And I'm with you, I think probably at the heart of our very way of being in the world
[0:43:22] Unknown: and our way of talking, when we say be human is don't be ashamed of yourself. Yeah, don't be
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_01: ashamed of the mess of the turbulence of the ups and the downs of what it means to be human. Don't
[0:43:35] SPEAKER_01: be ashamed because that's the infectious agent. Forget busy. Right. Fizzy is a little layer on top.
[0:43:43] SPEAKER_01: A little tiny little sprinkle on the cake of shame. Sure. But it's probably shame driving
[0:43:49] Unknown: the busyness if we were to really get to pathology reports, right? So I think that's it. And I think
[0:43:58] SPEAKER_01: we're always going to go for anything that creates more shame. And I think it is part
[0:44:02] SPEAKER_01: of why healing is tricky, quite frankly. Yeah. You know, I think it's part of why getting the
[0:44:07] Unknown: genuine states of positivity and love has a trickiness to it that for some reason,
[0:44:13] SPEAKER_01: we all think it shouldn't like we think it should be simpler. But I think part of the delicacy
[0:44:19] SPEAKER_01: of working with ourselves and even of us supporting others when we coach people or when we are coached
[0:44:27] SPEAKER_01: is the shame infection. So easily triggered. And once shame grabs a whole of the of the wiring
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_01: and starts to drive the bus, you can guarantee we're going in the wrong direction. Right. Healing
[0:44:40] Unknown: can't happen. Healing can't happen. We just go farther and farther down the pretend road, the
[0:44:46] Unknown: fake it, the be happy. You know, it's like, I don't know, sometimes social media is a really funny
[0:44:53] Unknown: human creation. You get to see so much because this like fake positivity you were talking about.
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_01: I mean, sometimes I read people's things and there are plenty uplifting and then you'll find out like
[0:45:03] SPEAKER_01: a year or so they're like, I've been dealing with this horrible chronic illness that I didn't
[0:45:07] SPEAKER_01: mention anything about. Yeah. And you know, they don't have to, of course, everything's very
[0:45:11] SPEAKER_01: personal. But I'm like, what? There's no way all of those things you were saying were the only thing
[0:45:15] SPEAKER_01: you were experiencing. But this is how we are driven, right? As you're saying, to kind of
[0:45:22] Unknown: the shame infection will move us towards any hint of humanness that I don't have this all worked out
[0:45:30] Unknown: yet. Makes it seem like I don't have something to offer. Like I'm not a being of value. And of course,
[0:45:37] Unknown: you and I have talked about this ad nauseum. So I think, you know, this may wind up being a little
[0:45:42] SPEAKER_01: bit of a long episode and I think maybe that should be okay if you're okay with it, Brooke. But
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_01: I'd love to just bring it towards, okay, so let's imagine we're all down for this pact that we're
[0:45:55] SPEAKER_01: going to be human together and we're not going to deny to ourselves what we're feeling and we're
[0:46:00] SPEAKER_01: going to allow it to be an investigation into what's actually happening for us and we're going to
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: allow it to be an invitation to love ourselves in that state. Let's imagine all bliss and grit
[0:46:12] Unknown: we're on for it. Now imagine we're in this unfolding process and we show up at a table
[0:46:19] Unknown: full of people. Family type people? Family, even friends, you know, even like our listener wrote
[0:46:29] SPEAKER_01: when she said like, I want to genuinely say to a friend, I'm not in a good state when a friend asks.
[0:46:34] Unknown: Now we all know there's certain moments where you and I, for example, Brooke talking, of course,
[0:46:40] Unknown: I'm just going to tell you when I'm shitty. We have that relationship but it is going to be
[0:46:45] SPEAKER_01: time dependent. I'm not going to do it right before August gets his tonsil surgery, for example.
[0:46:51] Unknown: I'm going to be very thoughtful about that. Well, what happens when you're at a holiday?
[0:46:57] SPEAKER_01: When you're around your family who doesn't have the capacity to hear all that? They're just
[0:47:01] SPEAKER_01: unskillful. God bless them. Then how do we navigate all of this?
[0:47:07] SPEAKER_00: I love that you just lobbed the ball over to my court. I have an answer for that.
[0:47:11] SPEAKER_01: I know. Well, it's perfect. I just set you up wonderfully.
[0:47:14] SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's beautiful. I think we should leave it on at least exploring what are some of the ways.
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_00: So I'm trying to think about, instead of coming up with some toolkit answer,
[0:47:26] Unknown: I'm trying to think about what's actually going on for me as I prepare for the holidays and family
[0:47:38] Unknown: visiting and that kind of thing. I mentioned it before but I'll just underline it because I have
[0:47:46] SPEAKER_00: just found for me it has such a direct relationship. The more I let myself get eaten by busy,
[0:47:51] Unknown: the less I am able to enjoy and appreciate and show up for my life. I can't enjoy my time with
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_00: my loved ones. I don't do the things that would be totally delightful. If I decide that everyone
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_00: has to have the perfect gift and I need to be out shopping and da, da, da, da, then I'm not going to
[0:48:09] Unknown: do something that's super really fun and intimate for me like my son and I making cinnamon rolls
[0:48:17] SPEAKER_00: together because we both like to bake and that's like a fun treat to eat that we don't make the
[0:48:21] Unknown: rest of the year and that's just genuinely delightful. That makes me feel positive and
[0:48:27] Unknown: we share intimacy and blah, blah, blah. I would say in moments where I've been around the table
[0:48:36] Unknown: recently with family members and let's say there's a lot of busy and heavy and agitation and that
[0:48:45] SPEAKER_00: kind of thing, it definitely doesn't turn into a showdown where I'm like calling people on their
[0:48:51] SPEAKER_00: shit. It doesn't seem like that's what's required in that moment because that's not what anyone has
[0:48:57] SPEAKER_00: signed up for. Nobody's at the family dinner table so that they can have their shit called out
[0:49:04] SPEAKER_00: and they don't need that from me. They don't need me to sherpa them to seeing the light.
[0:49:08] SPEAKER_00: What I've had to do in some of the more agitated moments,
[0:49:16] SPEAKER_00: agitated meaning the general air of everyone is like busy and stressed and like huffing and puffing
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_00: and it feels like one of those, you know, like everyone's kind of on the edge here
[0:49:27] Unknown: where this might wind up being an unpleasant gathering. This is going to sound, I hope this
[0:49:35] SPEAKER_00: doesn't sound obtuse, but it's what I'm actually doing and what's actually helping.
[0:49:39] SPEAKER_00: And it's so easy to fucking use this as a bypass, but I'm going to say it anyway.
[0:49:43] SPEAKER_00: What I will do is when I notice I'm getting caught in the swirl of agitation and for me,
[0:49:48] SPEAKER_00: that means because I'm a codependent person, I start trying to manipulate the energies of everyone
[0:49:54] SPEAKER_00: in a way where everyone can like understand each other and get along. When I catch myself doing that,
[0:50:01] Unknown: I will first go to the silence. Now, it's very easy to use that as a bypass where I'm checking
[0:50:09] SPEAKER_00: out from everyone, but instead what it feels like is, so when I say go to the silence, what I mean
[0:50:16] SPEAKER_00: is right now people are listening to my words and we're all used to hearing the sounds and the sounds
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: exist. And the example that I give people in my meditation classes a lot because I'm an artist is
[0:50:29] SPEAKER_00: we talk in drawings about positive space and negative space. So there's a white piece of paper
[0:50:35] Unknown: and then you grab an ink brush and you start painting on the piece of paper. The negative
[0:50:40] SPEAKER_00: space is the white piece of paper, the positive space is the ink mark you've just made,
[0:50:44] SPEAKER_00: the sounds are the positive space and there's still the negative space. I just stopped talking.
[0:50:53] SPEAKER_00: There it was. There's the quiet that the sounds come out of. So it's not woo woo and mystical,
[0:50:59] SPEAKER_00: it's just that there's both. There's sound and quiet. And when somebody's talking, there is also
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_00: this quiet that's happening that the sounds are emerging out of. And I don't need to make this
[0:51:10] SPEAKER_00: complicated, but there's just this way where when I connect with it, it feels like my body softens.
[0:51:16] SPEAKER_00: So people can also just do this in a somatic way. Feel your weight in the chair, feel the seat that
[0:51:22] SPEAKER_00: you're in, notice your breath. These are all just ways to come to awareness, right? So whatever
[0:51:28] SPEAKER_00: works for you, if you have a meditation practice, come to awareness. What I noticed then is that I,
[0:51:36] SPEAKER_00: the thing that emerges to the foreground, instead of me being in controller mode, is
[0:51:43] SPEAKER_00: love and affection. When I genuinely connect with awareness, love and affection is much more
[0:51:50] SPEAKER_00: available. Not perfect, but it's like suddenly it's available and I can have more affection for
[0:51:58] SPEAKER_00: everyone exactly as they are. It's not forced. It's not me making an announcement or saying
[0:52:06] Unknown: anything or trying to cheer people up. It's really just this very basic way of
[0:52:13] SPEAKER_00: of regarding people from a place of awareness feels different. Now, I wish that was like a cuter
[0:52:21] SPEAKER_00: tool, but it's just the thing that I'm actually using.
[0:52:28] SPEAKER_01: I think at an earlier time in my process with my family, what you were just describing would be
[0:52:35] SPEAKER_01: much harder for me to get to and to have access to that love and affection, though now I think
[0:52:42] SPEAKER_01: that would be a good tool for me. Some people are right here. I'm going to go back and remember
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_01: when I wasn't right here because same, same with my family now. In fact, they trigger me very little
[0:52:59] SPEAKER_01: and that's like a month by month getting better and better basis. This has been 40 something years
[0:53:07] SPEAKER_01: in the making where they trigger me less and less and I can like you access these different states
[0:53:15] Unknown: just by coming into awareness and coming into quiet, but there were phases in my own
[0:53:23] Unknown: truth process. So, okay, when I'm in my 20s, I think I had the easiest childhood in the world,
[0:53:30] SPEAKER_01: even though I have memories of it not at all being easy, but I think on a relative spectrum,
[0:53:35] SPEAKER_01: I wasn't locked into a closet and beaten and raped and so I had the easiest childhood in the
[0:53:39] Unknown: world, nothing very interesting. So, in my 30s, when I really started going to therapy and exploring,
[0:53:45] SPEAKER_01: it was the first time I was being honest that some of the things that happened were actually
[0:53:51] Unknown: excruciatingly painful and terrifying to my system. So, I was coming to truth with myself. Now,
[0:53:59] Unknown: as I was doing that, all of a sudden, I couldn't be around my parents that much,
[0:54:06] SPEAKER_01: especially my father at that moment. He was really holding a lot of it. So,
[0:54:11] SPEAKER_01: at that stage, there were a few choices because it was so raw. It was like finally acknowledging
[0:54:20] SPEAKER_01: terror that I had kind of pushed away as inappropriate or like put in the too scary box,
[0:54:27] Unknown: right? So, at those moments, if anyone's there, one option is you decide that it's in right
[0:54:36] Unknown: alignment not to see your family for the holiday. Sometimes that happens and that's the way you go
[0:54:43] SPEAKER_01: and it's in better alignment because you know you'll go, you'll explode, you'll cry, you'll vent.
[0:54:48] SPEAKER_01: You just kind of know the road that it will go down and it's for everyone's highest good. You just
[0:54:54] Unknown: bow out somehow. Sometimes you'll strategize. You'll only go for a couple of hours. Maybe you're
[0:55:01] SPEAKER_01: going to invite your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your best friend to come with you as a buffer.
[0:55:06] SPEAKER_01: People like that can be great buffers. You come up with a clever logistical scenario that feels
[0:55:15] SPEAKER_01: the most easeful that you can manage. Recognizing we are imperfect. At that moment, someone might
[0:55:21] SPEAKER_01: have said to me, don't go to your families and I'd be like, are you fucking kidding? Of course,
[0:55:25] SPEAKER_01: I have to go to my families. I'm deeply codependent. So, even that strategy as wise as it may be was
[0:55:31] SPEAKER_01: not available to me. Perhaps it is to all of you listening. But what I may have figured out is that
[0:55:38] SPEAKER_01: I was only going to go for a few hours and then I invented my ex-husband's family holiday that I
[0:55:44] SPEAKER_01: had to go to. So, the first is just get really honest about what you can tolerate, how much you
[0:55:51] SPEAKER_01: can show up without pouring all of your pain into the space, how kind you can be to yourself,
[0:55:58] Unknown: and you can set that up. The next thing I think I began to work with was in psychology,
[0:56:04] SPEAKER_01: we talk about dissociation. So, dissociation is this unconscious movement away from your own
[0:56:11] SPEAKER_01: emotions kind of packing it away. You may also think of it as an unconscious movement towards a
[0:56:15] Unknown: role. So, that's sort of what you were saying, Brooke. Historically, you may sit at a table with
[0:56:22] SPEAKER_01: your family and loved ones and go into people-pleasing mode or harmony maker mode or fix-it mode.
[0:56:28] Unknown: You don't even realize you've landed there or you're gossiping again the way you hate doing.
[0:56:33] Unknown: We kind of unconsciously cut away from our feelings and move into patterns of behavior.
[0:56:40] SPEAKER_01: But there is a term in psychology called dis-identification, which is a conscious
[0:56:46] Unknown: moving away from a state of being. So, for example, if I was about to teach a class when I was a
[0:56:52] SPEAKER_01: college professor and I was feeling kind of real and raw over some trauma, I was not going to bring
[0:56:58] Unknown: that into the classroom. Inappropriate. Not the right time, not the right place. So, I would
[0:57:06] SPEAKER_01: recognize the emotion. I would see it. I wouldn't push it away. But I would recognize I'm more than
[0:57:11] Unknown: that emotion, more than that memory, more than that trauma. And I would step into a different
[0:57:17] Unknown: aspect of self and go on with teaching. Does that make sense so far? Yeah. So, we could do the same
[0:57:23] Unknown: thing with our family. And that's sort of how I've always treated it. You know, the funny thing over
[0:57:29] Unknown: the years is all the pain I've had with loved ones, family members, friends, lovers, whatever
[0:57:37] Unknown: the case may be. I would say 90% of it, I worked it out inside of myself. Yeah. That's the thing.
[0:57:45] SPEAKER_00: You really do learn more and more and more that everything's an inside job, which isn't to say,
[0:57:50] SPEAKER_00: you know, make that an excuse to muzzle yourself. But I would say. Yeah. Yeah. You have to go with
[0:57:55] SPEAKER_01: your own direct experience of when it's appropriate for you to process it with somebody
[0:58:01] SPEAKER_01: or express it to somebody. I mean, I'm such a loner that your way may not be my way, right? But
[0:58:09] Unknown: so much of it is processed internally, because it is internal, because it's subjective. You know,
[0:58:16] SPEAKER_01: my parents, for me, growing up in my childhood home created a lot of pain. And at the same time,
[0:58:25] SPEAKER_01: they did a really good job in other ways. They were completely unskillful. They really didn't
[0:58:31] SPEAKER_01: know any better. And they did great compared to their parents. Right. So now if I just bring
[0:58:36] Unknown: everything I went through out into the dinner table onto their laps, there's a way it can't
[0:58:43] SPEAKER_01: be held by them, because it's not their experience of reality. And they don't have those skills. If
[0:58:49] SPEAKER_01: they had those skills, they probably wouldn't have had that pain to begin with. So for me,
[0:58:53] SPEAKER_01: a lot of the processing has happened on my own. But what that required to show up then at the
[0:58:58] SPEAKER_01: dinner table was I either opted out of certain things, holidays, no, but I saw them less. And I
[0:59:04] Unknown: talked on the phone with them less while it was healing. Nothing is forever. Right. So there's
[0:59:10] SPEAKER_01: phases and I stayed true to the phase. The second thing is we can show up and we can recognize we're
[0:59:16] SPEAKER_01: more than any feeling state and we can just allow it all to exist. We could be smart, we could be
[0:59:23] SPEAKER_01: mindful about it. But I think that generally that's sort of how I've interacted with not trying to
[0:59:33] Unknown: pretend I'm happy and be positive, but also not bringing all of my emotions into every moment so
[0:59:41] SPEAKER_01: that when my aunt asked me on Christmas Eve, how are you? I burst out crying over all of my pain
[0:59:49] Unknown: that I'm sick or over all of my childhood grief. Yeah. Yeah. And I just want to bring in one last
[0:59:56] SPEAKER_00: piece about a way to experience a little more gratitude, which involves time travel.
[1:00:04] Unknown: So great. Yes. I had-
[1:00:07] SPEAKER_01: Let's ground it in something.
[1:00:08] SPEAKER_00: Why not ground it really in time travel? So grounding. I had an experience at one point this
[1:00:16] SPEAKER_00: year at night, totally normal night, sitting on my couch in my living room, same thing that happens
[1:00:21] SPEAKER_00: every night. My son's asleep in his room. My dog's on the couch with me. Most boring thing in the
[1:00:25] Unknown: world. And all of a sudden- This gets a little mystical, but we can utilize this to access
[1:00:32] SPEAKER_00: gratitude. I have since it happened. All of a sudden I felt as if I were, let's say my 80-year-old
[1:00:41] SPEAKER_00: self, who had been gifted an opportunity to come back and be my 42-year-old self
[1:00:48] SPEAKER_00: and live that totally ordinary moment over again. So if you could imagine
[1:00:56] SPEAKER_00: you're 80 and you're looking through your photo album, if those still exist, which they won't,
[1:01:02] SPEAKER_00: you're looking through photographs and you see a picture totally, oh my God, that was my living
[1:01:08] SPEAKER_00: room when I was 42. I remember that couch. Oh my God, my dog. I remember his soft fur
[1:01:13] SPEAKER_00: and the sound of my son's breathing down the hall in the room. He's asleep. And it's just normal.
[1:01:18] SPEAKER_00: But if you could really relive that as your 80-year-old self, how much you would cherish
[1:01:24] SPEAKER_00: the fiber weave of the couch, the smell of the candle on the kitchen table. Everything would be
[1:01:30] SPEAKER_00: so cherished. And for whatever reason, I was gifted this experience as that actual experience,
[1:01:36] SPEAKER_00: where I felt like my 80-year-old self got to come into my body and live that. And so we're not all
[1:01:41] Unknown: going to have that descend into us. We're not going to have that kind of experience, but we can
[1:01:50] SPEAKER_00: play with that. If I were my 80-year-old self and I got to relive just this totally ordinary moment,
[1:01:58] SPEAKER_00: what would I appreciate? And that's just a more straightforward gratitude tool, but it can land
[1:02:05] SPEAKER_00: us in the present moment, which we don't all have a ton of facility with. So it's a nice tool for
[1:02:12] SPEAKER_00: getting here, really being here. My messy coffee table with the tea mug that I need to get rid of
[1:02:20] Unknown: suddenly becomes so sweet from that perspective. Yeah. I love that. There is something about loss
[1:02:28] SPEAKER_01: that invites us into gratitude. Because I'd been divorced, I remember that not all relationships
[1:02:34] SPEAKER_01: necessarily last forever. And somehow that makes me feel really grateful in the moment. I must be
[1:02:39] SPEAKER_01: such an existentialist at heart. Yes, you are. I think about people dying and then I feel grateful.
[1:02:46] SPEAKER_01: I can reflect you. You are.
[1:02:50] SPEAKER_01: Yours is a little sweeter, but I like it. And somehow, isn't just a piece of it when you get
[1:02:57] SPEAKER_01: into that gratitude, because just listening to that exercise you were sharing that you've been using,
[1:03:01] SPEAKER_01: it makes me just want to cry. Why is gratitude so heart opening? It feels almost overwhelming
[1:03:10] SPEAKER_01: and bursting. And maybe this is part of the dilemma with genuine positivity, is that
[1:03:16] Unknown: you have to let go of your contained self. You can't hold on to the containment and be in all
[1:03:23] SPEAKER_01: of these beautiful states of awe and wonder and actual gratitude and big, big, big love and big,
[1:03:31] SPEAKER_01: big, big bliss. It is a breaking open of all of the containers. And it can take a little bit,
[1:03:38] Unknown: I think, before we feel ready for that. Beautiful.
[1:03:46] SPEAKER_00: Beautiful.
