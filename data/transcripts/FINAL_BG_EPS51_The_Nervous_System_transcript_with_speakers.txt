[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_01: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about
[0:00:16] SPEAKER_01: being on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is a real
[0:00:21] SPEAKER_01: evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy,
[0:00:27] SPEAKER_01: the joys and the messes, the bliss and a grit that is a human life. Whether you're new to
[0:00:33] SPEAKER_01: the show or you've been listening for a while, here's the frame. We're not putting these
[0:00:38] SPEAKER_01: conversations forward as the word. We're sure as hell are not gurus, but we are a couple
[0:00:44] SPEAKER_01: of regular humans having a conversation and sharing our personal experiences as we follow
[0:00:51] SPEAKER_01: our own paths. So today we're talking about the glorious nervous system. Recently, we heard a
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_01: spiritual teacher named Matt Kahn say that the ego is the imagination of an overactive nervous
[0:01:06] SPEAKER_01: system. As long time mind body practitioners, we found this super interesting, especially since
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_01: it happened to coincide with our own exploration on how our limbic brain may be affecting our
[0:01:19] SPEAKER_01: health. So we got to thinking about the role the nervous system might play in awakening to truth.
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_01: In spiritual communities, you'll hear people talk a lot about concepts like fear versus love or fear
[0:01:31] SPEAKER_01: versus clarity. But is there benefit to exploring fear through the lens of the nervous system? Does
[0:01:38] SPEAKER_01: that exploration create more softness or does it actually trigger a shame spiral that births more
[0:01:44] SPEAKER_01: fear? So we're talking about all this and more as we explore the beauty that is our body. If you're

[0:02:24] SPEAKER_01: Brooke and I can curse sometimes. So if you're in mixed company, you may want to put on headphones.
[0:02:32] Unknown: Okay, here we go. Hello, Brooke. Hello, Vanessa. The topic at hand today is the nervous system.
[0:02:47] SPEAKER_01: And what if any role does it play in awakening to your truth? You know, awakening to yourself
[0:02:56] Unknown: or awakening to life or fuck it, awakening. Let's just say awakening. Let's just not crouch it.
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_01: I'm like just trying to skate around it. We say that we talk about that shit around here sometimes.
[0:03:05] Unknown: Fine. Let's just admit it. We're talking about awakening. The process of coming out of the closet.
[0:03:12] Unknown: So what role does that have to play? I went to the doctor last week. So I went to the doctor
[0:03:23] SPEAKER_01: because I got re-exposed to some stuff with mold in my house. And if you haven't listened for a
[0:03:29] SPEAKER_01: long time, I got sick from mold poisoning. So I have quite a severe reaction. So I got exposed
[0:03:35] SPEAKER_01: to some mold stuff and I had a relapse of some of my old symptoms. So I go to the doctor expecting
[0:03:42] SPEAKER_01: to test my immune system and, you know, kind of run through the physical exams that I'm accustomed
[0:03:48] Unknown: to. But this was a new doctor. And he basically spent the 30 minutes with me talking about how
[0:03:57] Unknown: this was a limbic system issue. And I was at first like, what are we talking about here? Right? Like
[0:04:05] SPEAKER_01: I got exposed to mold. I have physical symptoms that happen as a reaction because the toxins
[0:04:11] Unknown: affect you, you know, yada, yada, yada. And it's funny, Brooke, how, I don't know, everything comes
[0:04:20] SPEAKER_01: full circle, right? Like here I am a mind-body doctor. I mean, that's what I've always been,
[0:04:24] SPEAKER_01: right? A mind-body doctor, which is what Rolfing is, right? Forget the word doctor, but we are
[0:04:29] SPEAKER_01: mind-body practitioners. And I've studied the limbic system, which for all of you who are listening,
[0:04:37] Unknown: if you're not familiar, it's a part of the brain that gets activated when we perceive stress or
[0:04:44] Unknown: when we perceive an emergency. And it really queues up what we can call your fight, flight,
[0:04:49] Unknown: freeze, placate nervous system. So what he is essentially pointing towards was when the mold
[0:05:02] SPEAKER_01: comes in and attacks your brain, it stimulates, it attacks your limbic system. Your body perceives
[0:05:08] Unknown: an emergency. When your body perceives an emergency, it goes into a state of prolonged stress, yada,
[0:05:14] Unknown: yada, yada. You get sick, right? So I'm like, huh, okay. I mean, I sound like Godoy, right? Because
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_01: what we're talking about is PTSD. Something occurs. Your body has an intense reaction to it. It moves
[0:05:30] SPEAKER_01: into a state of fear. It perceives it has to fight for its survival and it creates a cascading
[0:05:36] SPEAKER_01: sequence of events, right? Including it affects your health, affects the way you see the world. So
[0:05:42] Unknown: we're really talking about this sort of very commonly spoken of PTSD cycle. Only in this case,
[0:05:50] SPEAKER_01: he's pointing to it having a physical trigger and sometimes it's a psychological trigger.
[0:05:54] SPEAKER_01: This is happening, right? I'm getting this information. He tells me to read this book at
[0:06:00] Unknown: the very same time as I'm listening to this talk by MatCon. I think it was the podcast on Sounds
[0:06:13] Unknown: True. It's the Sounds True producers pick where they pull an excerpt out of MatCon's book,
[0:06:19] SPEAKER_01: Whatever Arises Love That. And MatCon is talking about the ego. And I tried mentioning this last
[0:06:27] SPEAKER_01: week. It's very hard to describe this talk for some reason to my brain, but he's talking about
[0:06:32] Unknown: the nervous system and how the ego is the overstimulated nervous system. And that's happening.
[0:06:45] SPEAKER_01: And I'm having these profound shifts of love as a reaction to having listened to this whole talk.
[0:06:50] Unknown: And all of a sudden, guess what happens? My nervous system calms way down. And guess what?
[0:06:59] SPEAKER_01: I'm having less symptoms. Side note. I was just going to ask. You know, I'm curious. Yeah. Side
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_01: note. Not perfect, but less symptoms. Okay. So all of this is stirring around and I feel like I'm
[0:07:12] SPEAKER_01: going back to old school. Like, right. Maybe there's something to the nervous system, right? Like we
[0:07:17] SPEAKER_01: get on these kicks, I think so much about, maybe I'll think about the mind or I'll think about pain
[0:07:22] Unknown: bodies. Like, you know, I'll kind of group it into concepts. And this whole invitation to start to
[0:07:28] SPEAKER_01: really understand your body and look at how the human body is wired and this nervous system and
[0:07:34] Unknown: what impact it could have on our ability to be open and therefore in love, in receptivity, in
[0:07:40] Unknown: awakening or closed and therefore in fear, in shutdown seems to be where I'm back at again.
[0:07:50] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So let's talk about that. Yeah. No, it's as you know, on my mind a lot too, we were having
[0:07:55] SPEAKER_00: that synchronicity thing. And I got the book Vanessa mentioned is Wired for Healing, which I
[0:08:01] Unknown: also got and have not started reading yet. Well, this is where my mind is going first. So I'll
[0:08:08] SPEAKER_00: start here. So one of the things that I noticed because I'm a rolfing practitioner, and I see a
[0:08:15] SPEAKER_00: lot of people who have your standard fair structural issue stuff. But then I also see people come to
[0:08:22] SPEAKER_00: see me sometimes when they are at the end of their rope, because they have mysterious chronic
[0:08:26] Unknown: illnesses or chronic pain conditions. And I used to slash have one more episode left of liberated
[0:08:34] SPEAKER_00: body. So I've also talked with a lot of really smart people about pain and bodies. And why does
[0:08:40] Unknown: this stuff happen? So I understand that our nervous systems and the way we view the world either as a
[0:08:53] Unknown: safe place or as a place to be vigilant in the face of has an impact on our physiology, right?
[0:09:03] Unknown: Like the mind body divide is this completely mental construct, you know, it's, it's not even like
[0:09:11] SPEAKER_00: there's a two way street, there's no street, they're just the same fucking thing, you know, like it's
[0:09:15] Unknown: just there that they're exactly the same thing. So my point being, I will frequently with clients
[0:09:23] Unknown: who have these kinds of conditions want to pass on to them that I can do rolfing with them and it
[0:09:30] Unknown: will help. However, there is this underlying excessive charge in the nervous system that needs
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_00: to be addressed in order for any chronic pain condition to heal. And I'm also somebody who had
[0:09:43] Unknown: chronic pain for half of my life from a birth injury. So starting on day one. And what I always
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_00: have to do because of the culture we live in is to explain to people what I'm not saying when I say
[0:10:00] SPEAKER_00: that. So what I'm not saying to them is it's all in your head. There's something wrong with you
[0:10:07] SPEAKER_00: psychologically. You have some secret horrible thing that you've never uncovered that you're
[0:10:14] SPEAKER_00: about to uncover and it's wrecking your health. Like, I'm not saying any of those things, but it's
[0:10:19] SPEAKER_00: really amazing how quickly I watch when I tell people this information, which is basically just,
[0:10:24] Unknown: like, here's this piece of the healing puzzle is all I'm saying, really important one, like the
[0:10:29] Unknown: foundational piece of the healing puzzle. And we moved to shame so quickly because we're stuck in
[0:10:39] SPEAKER_00: the limbic system. Exactly. So it's like to deliver this information that way. Yes. I've like,
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_00: Oh no. So it's like, how do I deliver the information without nervous system going? I'm
[0:10:52] SPEAKER_00: fucked. And then you watch it spiral. Like the animal, right? Just goes like, I'm fucked. It's
[0:10:59] Unknown: terrifying. I have to vigilant. How do I fix it? I can't fix anything. Like it's just, um, and I
[0:11:07] SPEAKER_00: feel like this is such a common issue, not just for people with mystery issues or chronic pain.
[0:11:11] SPEAKER_00: Like we are living in a time. And I feel like in many ways, so much of like technology and all these
[0:11:18] SPEAKER_00: things that were supposed to make our lives so easy breezy so that we just don't even know what
[0:11:21] SPEAKER_00: to do with all of our time. And the fact that they've gone the exact opposite way and just made
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_00: us all excessively compulsively busy and revved all of our nervous systems up. It's almost like
[0:11:31] SPEAKER_00: it's, it's perfectly designed to bring us all of this nervous system breaking point where it breaks
[0:11:37] SPEAKER_00: and we're like, I give up. I have to figure out some other way because fuck this either fuck this
[0:11:46] SPEAKER_00: in a like exasperated, I'm not going to do it anymore way. Or the body says, fuck this with
[0:11:51] Unknown: chronic pain conditions or mystery illnesses. I know. Cause when this guy was saying it to me,
[0:12:01] SPEAKER_01: okay, so here I am. I'm a mind body practitioner on every level. I understand this, right? On every
[0:12:08] SPEAKER_01: single level. Yeah. You're saying it to me. My eyes are welling up. Like it's like what, but,
[0:12:14] SPEAKER_01: but like, you know, cause inside, what am I, if I could track back what I must've been feeling was
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_01: don't you see though, it's so serious. Like how could it just be this?
[0:12:25] Unknown: But what that statement is reflecting is how naive we can be about the effect of fear on us.
[0:12:35] SPEAKER_01: Right. But no, it's so serious that you can't possibly see how serious it is if you think it's
[0:12:40] SPEAKER_01: this. Right. And he's like, beloved, I do see how serious it is. Her whole body is hijacked by fear.
[0:12:47] Unknown: Yeah. And it's very, very painful. So what was so lovely was this wonderful raveling together. Can
[0:12:58] SPEAKER_00: something ravel together? I like it. I don't know if we're using it. It's good. If it can unravel,
[0:13:06] Unknown: it can unravel. So it ravelled together what was happening in my spiritual mind and what I'm aware
[0:13:17] Unknown: of with body wisdom, which was, Oh, in both cases, in my spiritual practices and in my spiritual
[0:13:25] Unknown: exploration and now in my health based exploration, I'm looking at the same thing, the effect that fear
[0:13:35] Unknown: has on a human being. And when we talk about fear on this show, or if we talk about pain bodies or
[0:13:42] Unknown: whatever wounds, whatever language we're putting to it, again, it's not something you're choosing
[0:13:49] SPEAKER_01: to do. Exactly. It's this primal survival system that's beyond conscious choice that has been hooked
[0:13:59] Unknown: and activated and then is running your circuitry. Right. So I'm like, Oh my God. So what everyone is
[0:14:08] Unknown: saying is, wow, fear is a huge part of the human experience. And it wreaks havoc on our ability to
[0:14:16] SPEAKER_01: see clearly. Right. That's the first thing that like an accelerated nervous system becomes hyper
[0:14:24] SPEAKER_01: vigilant to threat, which means it's not clear on when something is a threat versus when something's
[0:14:31] Unknown: neutral, right? Hyper vigilant nervous system starts to resonate with other hyper vigilant nervous
[0:14:38] Unknown: systems becomes more easily amplified. And just from a very basic level, it becomes shut down to
[0:14:47] SPEAKER_01: input. And so it keeps running off of its own concepts and predictions. Right? Well, that's the same
[0:14:55] SPEAKER_01: thing we would talk about if we were just talking from a spiritual angle and we were talking about
[0:15:00] Unknown: the effect of fear versus love, you know, or being in the past or future. Yeah, we're just
[0:15:07] Unknown: talking about conditioning or being in reality. Yeah. If you're conditioned to fear and vigilance.
[0:15:14] Unknown: Yeah, I know it's really fascinating. And there was something I was going to say about that or
[0:15:20] SPEAKER_00: what I've listened to so many MadCon talks in the last two weeks. We're coming. We love you.
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_00: We're super into it. So I actually couldn't accurately quote which one it was.
[0:15:36] Unknown: Shit. Now I also forgot what the fuck part I was going to point out. Oh, he was talking about,
[0:15:44] SPEAKER_00: because he's Mr. Love Revolution, right? And it's about meeting all of these places in yourself
[0:15:53] SPEAKER_00: with love and how if that's foreign to your nervous system,
[0:15:59] SPEAKER_00: it will be received as a foreign invasion, which of course sounds exactly like autoimmune disease.
[0:16:06] Unknown: Right? Like it's the healing aspect, the immune system attacking itself because it's afraid that
[0:16:13] Unknown: it is a foreign invader that needs to be attacked. So I thought that was fascinating. And like, as
[0:16:19] SPEAKER_00: somebody for me, if we're talking the like large level stories that I have or large level pain
[0:16:27] Unknown: bodies, belief systems, whatever you want to say, is that life is suffering. The world is disgusting.
[0:16:36] SPEAKER_00: I can't be trusted. I'm going to fuck it up. Like these are the things that I didn't know were
[0:16:42] Unknown: running my world until the past year, maybe two years, but past year. And so if you're somebody
[0:16:51] Unknown: like me who that was all of your conditioning to attempt to turn towards yourself with love,
[0:17:02] SPEAKER_00: my experience or if love has just arrived. So in my experience, it's been more like love just arrives.
[0:17:10] Unknown: I'll have some massive realization, like in a meditation or something, some realization about
[0:17:17] SPEAKER_00: oneness or some realization about no self. I've had two in the past year, totally coming out of
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_00: the closet today that have been really profound. And what I notice is that there's this period,
[0:17:29] Unknown: there's this honeymoon period after where it's like the world's biggest relief. It's like,
[0:17:38] SPEAKER_00: I used to fit in a thimble and now I'm the size of the universe and nothing in the whole world is
[0:17:44] SPEAKER_00: a problem. And it's like, I can finally breathe for the first time in my life. Like that kind of,
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_00: you can't even imagine it sensation of like unbelievable relief. It's like, there's nothing
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_00: in the world to be afraid of. There's nothing in the world that could ever make me unsafe.
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_00: And then something happens. And like this idea or what we're talking about with the nervous system
[0:18:07] SPEAKER_00: puts into context, fear eats me. It just devours me. And I go under the waves. And then there's
[0:18:16] Unknown: this, there's all this, and the fear isn't about a thing. Like the fear isn't about, this is what's
[0:18:22] SPEAKER_00: showing up or I had a bad day at work even, or whatever. It's just going about my normal life
[0:18:29] SPEAKER_00: with this gut level sensation of gnawing terror, the, of the exact opposite thing. Everything is
[0:18:35] SPEAKER_00: wrong in the world, blah, blah, blah. And so it's really interesting to think about like when ease
[0:18:44] SPEAKER_00: and love and relief and acceptance and safety come in, at a certain point, my body goes,
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_01: what the fuck? Danger. Yeah. Yeah. It's like when someone's nice to you on the streets of New York
[0:18:57] SPEAKER_00: and you're thinking, what is it you want? Like, what are you going to try and do? It's too unfamiliar.
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_01: I don't like this. This is not the normal way. Can't be good. Can not be good. Warning,
[0:19:11] Unknown: warning. This is a misalignment of what I expect. Yeah. And like I could make it a big deal. And I
[0:19:17] SPEAKER_00: certainly have, like fear is great at making everything a super big deal. But then you can
[0:19:23] SPEAKER_00: also put it in a spiritual context where it's like, oh, oh, this must be just a part of the
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_00: journey. And it is because that's what's happening. Like no one can argue that it isn't a part of the
[0:19:34] SPEAKER_00: journey, but the story of it must be a required part of the journey. So here, here's like sufferings,
[0:19:41] SPEAKER_00: little sneaky, it's not even a side door and it's like crawling through the pet door, the little cat
[0:19:47] SPEAKER_00: door in the back. It's like, oh yeah. But this is the part of the suffering that's required. It's
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_00: just that like when you're healing and when it's unfamiliar and when it's new, you're going to go
[0:19:57] SPEAKER_00: through periods of gut clenched terror and like just hang out with it. Just hang out. It's just
[0:20:04] SPEAKER_00: what happens. It's a normal part of the path. And it's like, it happens, but it doesn't happen
[0:20:10] SPEAKER_00: because it has to. It happens because your system's wired for the opposite. So there's this funny way
[0:20:15] SPEAKER_00: where you can like actually unhook it without having to endure months and months and months of
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_00: agony just because the new voice it's telling you is like, oh yeah, this is totally normal. It happens
[0:20:26] SPEAKER_00: to everyone. Just, you know, everyone has their dark night that lasts for, you know, one to 15
[0:20:33] SPEAKER_00: years. So I don't know which one you are, but this is your life now. And I'm not saying like,
[0:20:39] SPEAKER_00: ooh, I've seen it. And so now fear is not going to come back because fear absolutely is going to
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_00: come back because that's what my system knows how to do. But when I understand that it's just, that's
[0:20:47] Unknown: what my system knows how to do. It defangs it in a way that's just really helpful.
[0:20:54] SPEAKER_01: Well, and I think you can also catch the medicine in it. So what's the medicine of Matt? Why have
[0:20:59] SPEAKER_01: you been listening to him right now so much, right? Because it's not just about what we spoke about
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_01: last week. Okay. So I see the fear, I see the fangs, I see my survival mechanisms,
[0:21:11] Unknown: I see the primal wiring. Okay. I tolerate it until it passes. It's like, and I can love that,
[0:21:19] SPEAKER_01: right? That arises and I can love that. And this part of me that this wound that's rising up to
[0:21:25] SPEAKER_01: be held, I can love that, right? I can hold that. And, and so then what you're really doing is
[0:21:30] Unknown: putting into motion the, the medicine, right? The soothing balm, right? Which is like, okay,
[0:21:39] SPEAKER_01: how loving is it to say, it's not necessary that you have to hang out here. Now, maybe you do,
[0:21:45] SPEAKER_01: but then we'll just love that. And as soon as there's love, it doesn't feel so dark and scary
[0:21:49] Unknown: to hang out there, right? It has this like soft light quality to it, this soft light texture to it.
[0:21:58] Unknown: I was thinking about the talk we had shared a few weeks back, I think we had done the whole episode
[0:22:05] SPEAKER_01: on it, where Matt was saying, what is it that's going through the journey, right? So if consciousness
[0:22:12] SPEAKER_01: is and always was awake, but how could consciousness not is and always be awake?
[0:22:18] SPEAKER_01: If that's the case, then what is it that we're all referring to when we say, oh, we're on a journey,
[0:22:24] Unknown: or we're on a path, or we're evolving and growing. And he said, it's the body. That was his opinion,
[0:22:31] Unknown: his experience. He said, it's the body, the body is awakening to consciousness, the body is awakening
[0:22:38] Unknown: to your your divinity, if that's a fair word to use. So when I started thinking about that,
[0:22:46] Unknown: when I started thinking about the nervous system, and you know, everything that we're going through,
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_01: and this this very beautiful and moving concept of loving your body, like having patience with
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_01: your body as it awakens to the truth that you catch glimpses of in your own awareness mind,
[0:23:06] SPEAKER_01: I thought, wow, soothing your nervous system. Good boy.
[0:23:12] SPEAKER_00: I love that we're bringing good boy back into the vernacular, by the way.
[0:23:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm sure it's a very popular word amongst the young people.
[0:23:21] Unknown: Crazy. I mean, it's so straightforward, but it got me thinking like, right, what was it that I loved,
[0:23:31] SPEAKER_01: loved about being at Crestone, you know, at Dharma Oceans program, meditating with the body?
[0:23:40] SPEAKER_01: Well, you know, you do all of these meditations where you're laying down,
[0:23:45] Unknown: where your nervous system gets to rest, right? I mean, your entire nervous system just melts
[0:23:53] SPEAKER_01: when you're like in this laying down posture, and you're feeling your body, and we're in Crestone,
[0:23:59] SPEAKER_01: and the energy is so good, and you know, you're being fed healthy food, and you have no electronics,
[0:24:06] SPEAKER_01: right? So all of that is set up, and my nervous system is relaxing it. Now, as that happens,
[0:24:13] Unknown: then just naturally, I become more open. There's nothing to be done about it and not forcing.
[0:24:19] Unknown: It's not even with a goal, right? But as I'm being like, soothed by the whole experience, then,
[0:24:27] SPEAKER_01: for me, because I get some of those like visuals and mystical experiences, I can start to see
[0:24:32] SPEAKER_01: things, I can start to know things, I started to just embody, like, you know, like land in my body,
[0:24:39] Unknown: because all of a sudden, there was an ease present, and it didn't feel unsafe, which is just very
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_01: different than mentally telling yourself you're safe. You know, like, it's safe, you should be
[0:24:53] SPEAKER_01: able to do this. Like, come into your body, feel yourself in your body now, you know, like, why
[0:24:57] SPEAKER_01: aren't you in your body, motherfucker? Like, it's okay, you're not in your body. No, no, I have tons
[0:25:02] SPEAKER_01: of patients, but get in your body. I know, but you're doing it wrong, PS. Now, come on, like,
[0:25:06] Unknown: how about now? You know, it's just such a different thing. So after this weekend, where this weekend,
[0:25:14] SPEAKER_01: Hurricane Irma happened, and I lived in Miami for five years, I have such fondness for it,
[0:25:18] SPEAKER_01: I have so many friends there, you know, Hurricane Harvey just happened in Texas, like, a month ago,
[0:25:24] Unknown: I don't know, weeks ago, whatever it was. So fucking much going on in the world, and my nervous system
[0:25:31] Unknown: is like all tense, right? I spent a weekend looking at Facebook like a maniac. So today, I was like,
[0:25:40] Unknown: I'm gonna go for restorative yoga class. And the part that's afraid, I'm gonna love that. And the
[0:25:47] Unknown: body that's kind of all taught, I'm gonna love that. And I just started to bring in this
[0:25:53] Unknown: understanding and apply it, right? Like, okay, I can make spaciousness, I can start to bring in some
[0:26:05] Unknown: warmth and soothing. And then from there, my cells can open, right? Like, you've read Bruce
[0:26:14] SPEAKER_01: Lipton's biology of belief, right? You ever read that book?
[0:26:17] Unknown: It's been a while. Yes. But it's been so long, I couldn't...
[0:26:21] SPEAKER_01: Well, there's just one thing I take from it, that I always take from it, that cells are either
[0:26:27] Unknown: opened or closed. Right? They either are receptive, and then they can take in nutrients, they can take
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_01: in information that they need, energy information that they need to function, or they're defended
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_01: and closed. And he uses that cells as a that cellular understanding as a metaphor for us,
[0:26:51] SPEAKER_01: we're either open or closed. We don't think of it like that. Because it's like, even when
[0:26:57] SPEAKER_01: my limbic system is hijacked, and I'm in a state of fear, I still love Brooke, right? I still feel
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_01: you, I still get input from you, right? Like, you can affect the way I'm perceiving something,
[0:27:10] Unknown: or you can make me laugh, right? So we don't perceive it as open or closed.
[0:27:17] SPEAKER_01: But I do have to imagine there's something about when we're in fear, that leaves us
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_01: mostly in the world of concept. So I happen to also like to love, and I like to laugh,
[0:27:31] SPEAKER_01: and I like Brooke, and I like the concept of Brooke, and I like the concept of my friendship. And so
[0:27:36] SPEAKER_01: I can be open to all of that, because it's not foreign data. Right? It's all what I'm expecting.
[0:27:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's all what I'm like open towards in a in a way. But what about new information?
[0:27:50] SPEAKER_01: What about being in touch with reality that's got gobs of information, right? Coming at you at any
[0:27:56] SPEAKER_01: point? What about the fact that maybe there's I don't know, could there be an angel over my
[0:28:02] SPEAKER_01: shoulder? I don't know. Maybe. Right? Like, I don't know, right? What would I be open to that?
[0:28:10] Unknown: You know, and that so maybe it is so cut and dried as to say, we're either in alarm, and therefore
[0:28:19] SPEAKER_01: we're shutting down, and only including information that we have at some point deemed as acceptable.
[0:28:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Or we're open to reality, in which case everything is coming through in some unfiltered
[0:28:34] Unknown: way that feels really welcome. What do you think about that? I like it. Right? A lot of people
[0:28:42] Unknown: think of things just like this. Yeah, that's true. I think you're onto something.
[0:28:47] SPEAKER_00: Um,
[0:28:52] SPEAKER_00: fuck my words. I mean, I think all of our episodes might just devolve into you and I going like,
[0:29:00] SPEAKER_00: more brain fart, more brain fart. It is a little worrisome, but it's also fine.
[0:29:04] SPEAKER_00: Um, this is what happens when you're exploring new turf.
[0:29:09] SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's what I was gonna say. Yeah, just
[0:29:11] Unknown: if you're one of the nervous systems where it's more vigilant and you're more in fight,
[0:29:19] SPEAKER_00: flight, freeze. I like to placate being at it, by the way. That was news to me.
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_01: That is a very good addition. Yeah. In the field of trauma research.
[0:29:28] Unknown: Makes good sense. Um, and so of course you're, you're filtering for what fits with your concept
[0:29:36] Unknown: in this open closed model. It goes without saying that like, there is so much goodness
[0:29:44] SPEAKER_00: and it comes down to a question and like, this is for me, what I get to play with right now is like,
[0:29:48] SPEAKER_00: can I tolerate it? I mean, I think most of us don't have the concept that we are intolerant
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_00: of ease and goodness and nourishment and safety. Um, what I've learned about myself is that like,
[0:30:03] SPEAKER_00: there was an intolerance there and now it's like, I'm a person in recovery and I'm, I'm a
[0:30:11] SPEAKER_00: hardness junkie in a certain way, not because I'm a bad person, not because I like it, like,
[0:30:18] Unknown: but just because that's how I learned how to orient in the world and completely below the level
[0:30:25] SPEAKER_00: of awareness. So then it comes up to the level of awareness and it's like, oh, what I'm doing is,
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_00: is just building my capacity, my tolerance for ease and goodness and nourishment.
[0:30:35] SPEAKER_00: And there will be good days and bad days. Like there will be days where
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_00: I just don't feel that way. Right. And like, and so fear is there and then I have to turn towards
[0:30:46] Unknown: that and see, can I love that? Which is like really an amazing practice because it, it hijacks you,
[0:30:54] SPEAKER_00: takes you off down its road, you know, where it's telling you the stories like, oh,
[0:30:59] SPEAKER_00: fuck, I'm consumed by fear again. I thought that was over. I was feeling really good for a while.
[0:31:02] Unknown: Why is this still happening? And then as soon as you catch yourself having that kind of conversation,
[0:31:08] SPEAKER_00: you can go like, oh, the one who doesn't want to have to feel fear anymore. And it's so angry
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_00: that they feel it. I love you. Like the fear itself, the gut clench that in its innocence
[0:31:20] Unknown: thinks it needs to be there. Just got wired to be there. Like, I love you. Like, but really like,
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_00: oh, I see you. So I guess it starts with, I see you. Right. And Matt cotton talks about that too,
[0:31:30] SPEAKER_00: but it's just so relieving even to do the, I see you. And then like, oh, of course, you know,
[0:31:36] SPEAKER_00: it's totally an innocence. Of course you're there. Of course that's your habit. Well,
[0:31:41] SPEAKER_01: did you trip out on the part where, I mean, in this podcast episode that I referenced at the
[0:31:47] Unknown: beginning where he's talking about the ego being the imagination of an overactive nervous system,
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: what he's essentially saying is your nervous system is picking up the activity in other
[0:31:59] Unknown: people's nervous systems. Yeah. And patterning. Right. And patterning. Right. So especially if
[0:32:05] Unknown: you're a sensitive person, empathic person, you're picking up on all of this debris floating around
[0:32:14] Unknown: in other people's nervous systems. Right. And he described something that I felt was really true
[0:32:19] Unknown: for me because he said that at first he took it to mean something about him. Right. Well, okay. I
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_01: can feel all this stuff happening in someone's nervous system. They seem upset or they seem angry
[0:32:32] Unknown: or sad or, you know, afraid, whatever you're picking up on. So it must be something about me.
[0:32:38] SPEAKER_01: Right. Like they don't like me. Maybe. Right. Yeah. Maybe I could be more pleasing. Yes. They
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_01: must not like me because they have all this stuff that's up. Right. Which was where he was developing,
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_01: you know, mistaken thinking, which I can totally relate to. Yeah. And then he went further to say,
[0:32:56] SPEAKER_01: well, okay, so all this stuff is up in their nervous system and I can feel it in their field.
[0:33:02] SPEAKER_01: Right. Because the nervous system is electrical. So like, hello, if energy is coming off someone,
[0:33:07] Unknown: it makes sense to use this way of looking at it. So I will then take all of this energy out of their
[0:33:16] SPEAKER_01: field into mine and then they'll be available to like me. Right. Or love me or resonate at this level.
[0:33:22] SPEAKER_01: And I really got that because I could imagine like you're absorbing things from people's field,
[0:33:28] Unknown: right. From their nervous system and you're patterning just like them. So it's like,
[0:33:35] SPEAKER_01: okay, I got that. And I thought that was really interesting because I think it was last week where
[0:33:41] SPEAKER_01: I was talking about loving the part of me that was dying, you know, this spontaneous movement to wrap
[0:33:47] SPEAKER_01: myself in love and observing that there's this piece of me that sometimes just wants to give up.
[0:33:53] SPEAKER_01: It's like that particular little wounded part that's really actually quite young was like,
[0:34:00] SPEAKER_01: why bother? Right. You know, like I'll die. No one even cares if I die. You know, it doesn't mean
[0:34:05] SPEAKER_01: anything anyway. It's like, that's what sort of the tenor of this part was. And I'm discussing it
[0:34:12] SPEAKER_01: with Kieran and I have this sort of revelation that's like, oh my God, you know, because when
[0:34:17] SPEAKER_01: I was up against my parents, I think that's some of what they were feeling. Like if my kids don't
[0:34:22] SPEAKER_01: love me, they're my whole life, right? I gave my whole life to my family, everything I am,
[0:34:30] SPEAKER_01: every choice I made, they made through this filter of family has to be first and family is sacrifice
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: and love is sacrifice, right? Those were all the things they absorbed. And so there was this real
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_01: life and death quality about it. Like if the family wasn't feeling nourishing to them, it felt like
[0:34:51] Unknown: there was no point to their life. Right. And so then that's part of what I'm absorbing into my
[0:34:58] SPEAKER_01: nervous system is like, oh, there's no point to life if I'm not doing it right. Right. If I'm
[0:35:04] Unknown: not making them happy. And here we are just these like resonating bands. And so I'm okay. That's so
[0:35:12] Unknown: interesting. Cause once I can see it that way, you know, it's part of what we're talking about is the
[0:35:18] Unknown: depathologizing of these things for everybody. That's why Matt uses that word innocence,
[0:35:24] Unknown: which is such a beautiful word. Cause it's like it all, it's all happening in innocence. It's all
[0:35:30] SPEAKER_01: just, we have these little tender hearts and we want to be happy and we do want people to be happy
[0:35:35] SPEAKER_01: and everyone just wants to love. And all these things are just happening in innocence. We're
[0:35:38] SPEAKER_01: modeling to kind of be like them and to maybe take some of their pain and you know, and here we are,
[0:35:44] Unknown: we don't even understand. We can't even understand, you know, the kind of choices that are being made,
[0:35:51] Unknown: right? They're just choices that are being made by our system, you know, which is divine and who can
[0:35:57] Unknown: understand that. So I just thought that was all the really interesting thing. And the depathologizing
[0:36:05] SPEAKER_01: is so important because it's like something you and I were just talking about. We rail against the
[0:36:12] SPEAKER_01: field of self-help sometimes and it's not because anyone is a problem. Like there's a teacher that
[0:36:19] SPEAKER_01: we're trying to admonish. It's because we get upset with the concept that we are a problem or that we
[0:36:29] SPEAKER_00: have a problem to solve. Now we need to keep striving and self-improving so that we're finally
[0:36:35] Unknown: worthy to exist. Because that line of thinking is coming from a cranked nervous system. Yes, it is.
[0:36:46] Unknown: And that line of thinking feeds the cranked nervous system. Yeah, it just keeps feeding the demon.
[0:36:54] Unknown: And then we can't feel the love. Right. And then we're like, what's the problem? Why am I stuck here?
[0:37:00] SPEAKER_01: I just want to feel the love. There must be something wrong with me. Let me try something.
[0:37:03] SPEAKER_00: I know. I mean, story of my fucking life up until I discovered there was this whole other way to go.
[0:37:09] Unknown: But it's like, oh, okay. I can just lean in harder with this new strategy. And then like, oh,
[0:37:17] SPEAKER_00: that didn't work. Okay, well, I guess I have to actually lean in harder. I guess that's why I
[0:37:21] SPEAKER_00: was saying before I feel like there is something so beautiful in the fact that we're all so burnt
[0:37:25] Unknown: out. Because at a certain point, you say uncle, and you're just like, I'm not willing to keep
[0:37:34] SPEAKER_00: striving. I'm not willing to keep adopting new strategies or to keep self-improving, like,
[0:37:39] SPEAKER_00: or to keep suffering in this way. Like, I'm just not willing. There has to be something else going
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_00: on. And then suddenly you see that like all of the attempts to get away from the fear,
[0:37:52] Unknown: we're feeding the beast. And it's like, oh, and then, you know, it's quite shocking. Like,
[0:37:59] Unknown: how do I have even any capacity to not suffer? Like, oh my God, are you shitting me? Like,
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_00: so much of this has just been my own habit of suffering. And then like the voice comes in like,
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: ah, you're not yes. And that's the way you're a fuck up is the way like, oh, good. As long as I
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_00: get to point a finger at something you're doing wrong, I'll take it. Whatever. The thing you're
[0:38:25] Unknown: doing wrong is suffering, like that you're addicted to suffering. And since we're just
[0:38:32] SPEAKER_00: going to quote Matt Kahn this entire episode, and maybe many more, I don't know. He was talking
[0:38:40] SPEAKER_00: about that the reason why he asked the universe for guidance, like on the question, what is the
[0:38:47] SPEAKER_00: ego? Certainly he was somebody who is well versed, but like, no, really tell me what is the ego
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: is because what we want to do in spiritual circles is just make it a problem all day long.
[0:38:59] SPEAKER_00: And I was listening to this this morning before this talk, he was like, and I just know
[0:39:06] Unknown: that it cannot be coming from the highest wisdom. If it's against something, it if it's not coming
[0:39:16] SPEAKER_00: from love, it can't be real, highest wisdom. So if we keep like, oh, okay, well, it's that underneath
[0:39:26] SPEAKER_00: this fuck up ego that's wrecking everything with its wrecking ball conditioning and the mess it's
[0:39:32] SPEAKER_00: making of its life. There's something there's some true nature, there's some genuine self,
[0:39:36] SPEAKER_00: and I'm gonna, I'm gonna get rid of it, the enemy, the ego, so that I can fix it.
[0:39:42] SPEAKER_00: And we have to make friends with everything, right? Like, it's not this separate thing that's
[0:39:51] SPEAKER_00: the real demon that's wrecking our lives. Like, how do we even just see,
[0:39:57] SPEAKER_00: coming back to that word, innocence, like it's beautiful, beautiful innocence.
[0:40:02] SPEAKER_00: And just to loop back to what I was saying about, you know, trying to talk with clients about these
[0:40:06] Unknown: concepts, I'm, I always feel like I'm trying to crack the code. Like, how do I communicate
[0:40:12] Unknown: this information in a shame free way? Like where their system isn't going to move to shame and
[0:40:18] Unknown: self condemnation? Like how, and I haven't cracked the code, you know, because of course, I think
[0:40:23] SPEAKER_00: it's unique for everyone, but also because that's what nervous systems that are cranked do. They
[0:40:27] SPEAKER_00: immediately go, oh, okay, there's a problem with me. She's pointing out the problem with me.
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_00: And then it can adapt it and whatever flavor at once. Like it's because
[0:40:36] SPEAKER_00: she thinks I'm traumatized. It's because she thinks whatever. And really all I'm saying is like,
[0:40:41] Unknown: there is a way, there is a way home. Like there is a way, there's such good news. Like the good news
[0:40:49] Unknown: is there's nothing wrong with, like nothing is a problem. Which is a whole other thing.
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_00: Only here's the problem.
[0:40:59] SPEAKER_00: Only. Well, this is what I was saying before. Like there's nothing, nothing is a problem
[0:41:04] SPEAKER_00: and the suffering is real. Like,
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_01: well, I think that's what you're pointing to though, is the dangerous, dangerous,
[0:41:12] SPEAKER_01: it's not fucking dangerous. That's, that's a melodramatic word, but the, the edge, right? The,
[0:41:17] Unknown: the edge that you're noticing is we're a culture of problem solvers, right? Like that's what we do
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_01: when we want to control life. So we decide what the problem is and we decide how we will uniquely
[0:41:32] SPEAKER_01: solve the problem. And that gives us a sense that we're in control. If there's no problem to solve,
[0:41:39] SPEAKER_01: how can we be better? Oh my God, I just have to trust life that something's going to happen.
[0:41:44] SPEAKER_01: Right? So we don't do that. We're a culture of problem solvers. So with that,
[0:41:48] SPEAKER_01: as soon as someone discusses something, the other person's already turning it into a problem to
[0:41:54] SPEAKER_01: solve. And the whole language of the conversation gets loaded with there's a problem, here's how to
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_01: solve it. Right? And it's so easy for that conversation to get loaded that way, right? Because
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_01: language maybe has a way of doing that in general, right? So we're like, Oh, beloved, your nervous
[0:42:14] SPEAKER_01: system is cranked. Here's the problem. And so then what you're going to do is, and here's the
[0:42:20] SPEAKER_00: solution, right? So in the solution is the potential to get it wrong or get it right.
[0:42:26] SPEAKER_01: Right. It's like, that's why language fails. So I mean, a of course, it's not your job to figure out
[0:42:31] Unknown: how to say it to them. But what suppose we are working with is, if we can embody that in our
[0:42:40] SPEAKER_01: nervous system, then we can be potent messengers for people, right? Just vibrationally. Oh my God,
[0:42:48] SPEAKER_01: the term I heard today, when I was listening to Whatever Arises, love that. And if anyone knows
[0:42:56] SPEAKER_01: Matt Kahn, and you want to get him on the show for us, clearly, we're having a love affair with
[0:43:00] Unknown: him. So let us know about that. Make it happen. Make it so. So the quote he said today was
[0:43:07] Unknown: vibrational codependency. Yeah, it's a good one. That's a goodie. And it's kind of a side note on
[0:43:16] SPEAKER_01: what we were actually talking about. But I just had to know it's such a goodie. But with
[0:43:21] Unknown: vibrational codependency, there is such a thing as we reach a certain state of vibration and people
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_01: resonate there. It's just like that. It's just how it is, right? That's why it can feel really
[0:43:33] SPEAKER_01: powerfully healing to be around certain teachers, you know, that you can feel safe, and you can open
[0:43:40] SPEAKER_01: and you can you can reach these states. It's part of what we're we're appreciating about Matt right
[0:43:45] Unknown: now. So all that was to say is I don't think it's the words anyway. I think it's as we're taking that
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_01: into our system and really starting to reorient to we don't have to make this a problem. Because,
[0:44:02] Unknown: you know, like you were saying, everything's one. So where could there be a problem? How could anything
[0:44:10] SPEAKER_01: be a problem? How could I have a problem with anyone? If everything's one, if everything's one,
[0:44:15] SPEAKER_01: how can my body be a problem? If everything's one, how can death be a problem? How there are
[0:44:21] SPEAKER_01: there can be problems. But we're not starting from the philosophical experience or vantage point that
[0:44:28] Unknown: we are one. So then our language gets based around problem solve. Yes, exactly. Right,
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_01: which is very time and place oriented and very separation oriented. Yeah. So of course,
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_01: it's hard, right? Because until you're at the vantage point, like the actual experience of
[0:44:47] Unknown: Holy shit, it really is one. Right. And oh, my God, nothing's a problem. What? Whoa, then how do you
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_01: get there? Right? Yeah. So then you just have to deliver what we can deliver both to ourselves
[0:45:01] SPEAKER_01: and to each other, which is with as much love and softness as we can. Yeah. Which is like this,
[0:45:07] Unknown: this hurts. And it's all okay. And I love it. Love you. Yeah. It's really masterful shit. I mean,
[0:45:17] SPEAKER_01: that's why we already have known this. This is not at all new information. And we're still
[0:45:25] SPEAKER_01: mind blowing from it. Yeah. Because it's masterful shit, at least for us. I mean, at least for me.
[0:45:31] SPEAKER_00: I think that this is masterful shit. I'm going to go ahead and say that it just is. On our planet,
[0:45:38] Unknown: it is, you know, to actually land in this experientially and to not do all the cognitive
[0:45:46] SPEAKER_00: trickiness, which is either a problem solution, making it a problem, or saying like, well, yes,
[0:45:51] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to be on the A team of spiritual masters if I say that I understand oneness. So what I'm
[0:45:56] SPEAKER_00: going to do is say, nothing's a problem. And I'm going to go go up, up and away and like,
[0:46:01] SPEAKER_00: everything's great. And just if anyone ever comes to you in pain or suffering or with a heavy heart,
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_00: you just, yeah, you just sort of shut them down with the like, oh no, but it's all good. You know,
[0:46:13] SPEAKER_00: which is not, or you always move away, you know, like, oh, those, those humans with their
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_00: stinky problems. I don't, I don't dwell in that realm anymore. Right. So like,
[0:46:26] SPEAKER_00: this is what we can watch all over the place. These varieties of ways of us trying to land
[0:46:36] Unknown: in this experience and getting tripped. Yeah. Getting almost farther,
[0:46:44] SPEAKER_01: farther in a different direction. Right. Well, this is why it's all about experience, right?
[0:46:49] SPEAKER_01: So our words are just carrying an experience ultimately. And that's why we have to discover
[0:46:56] SPEAKER_01: for ourselves, like until I could have that experience, like, oh my God, I actually loved
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_01: myself. This is what it means to move towards your body. Like it's a baby. I heard, I heard Kieran
[0:47:08] SPEAKER_01: talk about that. I didn't get there yet. You know, like we need to have that experience,
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_01: the experience of oneness or these things are just ideas and ideas can be twisted in any which way
[0:47:20] SPEAKER_01: that our system wants to, especially if our systems hijacked in fear,
[0:47:24] SPEAKER_01: it will twist it into a way that fits more in alignment with our reality.
[0:47:29] SPEAKER_00: Right. And then sometimes you won't catch it forever down the road. And like, I'm in the middle
[0:47:33] SPEAKER_00: of a bajillion of those right now. And I'll look back and I'll go, huh, I didn't see that either.
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_00: And I remember when we saw Adyashanti and Ithika, it was so relieving. He was like, it's not a
[0:47:41] Unknown: problem. Like, don't worry about getting it wrong. Like your devotion to opening, right? Like your
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_00: devotion to openness to reality and to life will always self-correct course. Doesn't matter. Like
[0:47:59] SPEAKER_00: go have that big, awful, messy, high drama relationship. And then you'll, you'll eventually,
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_00: you'll go, I'm done now. You know, like,
[0:48:08] Unknown: yeah, you ride it until the wheel falls off. Exactly. Be the slow blink spiritual person
[0:48:13] SPEAKER_00: who really thinks that they're the ascended one and they really get it. And then, and then you'll
[0:48:18] Unknown: go, oh my God, I'm such an asshole. And then you'll course correct. Like it's fine. We're humans.
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_01: We're going to do it. You can't control the unfolding of truth anyway. So guess what? It's
[0:48:29] SPEAKER_01: all happening. So guess what? It's all like ultimately okay. But I feel like what we can do
[0:48:37] Unknown: if it feels right is we can say, oh, like I did this weekend, I spent all weekend cranking
[0:48:45] SPEAKER_01: my nervous system and flooding it with fear. And I did it on purpose. I really wanted to know what
[0:48:51] SPEAKER_01: was happening with my friends. I didn't feel like being cut off from the world. And you know, so
[0:48:56] Unknown: that's fine. But now I could maybe immerse myself in something softer, right? Because that would be
[0:49:04] SPEAKER_01: very loving to my body. And then I support myself and being able to be open. And I think that's a
[0:49:10] SPEAKER_01: really simple and loving thought. And you know what Matt says, I think part of what I'm appreciating
[0:49:17] SPEAKER_01: is you do all this work with your chakras and opening this and opening that. And I think there's
[0:49:22] Unknown: a lot to be said on that topic. But ultimately, if you can walk in love, if you if, if as you can,
[0:49:30] Unknown: you know, immerse in love, it all opens and aligns. Yeah, what's more juicy than that?
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_01: Rather than having to breathe for, you know, a two week retreat just into my heart chakra,
[0:49:43] SPEAKER_01: like, oh, if I could just walk in love, it all opens in the line. It's like what a beautiful
[0:49:47] SPEAKER_01: practice. Probably people listening have even more to say about the nervous system
[0:49:53] SPEAKER_00: than we just addressed. There's so Oh, for sure. And when we first brought up the topic, I was like,
[0:49:59] SPEAKER_00: you know, what I don't want to do is go into liberated body brain and be like, well, you know,
[0:50:03] SPEAKER_00: this research because like, that's all good and useful. But we're really trying to point to
[0:50:09] SPEAKER_01: the experience, the experience, I want to hear your experiences. I know, I know one listener
[0:50:16] SPEAKER_01: in particular who is beautifully obsessed with helping people find self care through bringing
[0:50:24] SPEAKER_01: love and compassion through the nervous system. And it's really gorgeous. And, you know, if all
[0:50:30] SPEAKER_01: of you out there, because I know a lot of people are listening to us who started at liberated body,
[0:50:35] SPEAKER_01: so I know there's a good percentage of listeners who may be like, nervous system crusaders,
[0:50:41] SPEAKER_01: who are out there, bring in the good word to the world. Here's the one little bit of advice I would
[0:50:47] SPEAKER_01: give is that as we are advocates for love and care for our nervous system, let's not scream so loud
[0:50:54] SPEAKER_01: that people get frightened that they have a problem. You know what I'm saying? I do know,
[0:50:58] SPEAKER_00: and I've done it to so many clients and myself for so many years. I get it.
