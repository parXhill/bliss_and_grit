[0:00:31] SPEAKER_01: You're listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:33] SPEAKER_01: I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas.
[0:00:39] SPEAKER_01: On the show, we're having conversations about the awakening spiritual path.
[0:00:44] SPEAKER_01: What does that even mean?
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_01: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_01: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:51] SPEAKER_01: The beauty and the crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human
[0:00:56] Unknown: life.
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_01: Today, we're speaking about the implication of how we choose our words.
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_01: Historically, we've both bristled at what we perceived as a turn-your-frown, upside-down
[0:01:10] SPEAKER_01: kind of positive approach to language.
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_01: These days, though, we've both been called towards exploring the intersection of language,
[0:01:18] SPEAKER_01: evolution, and creation.
[0:01:21] SPEAKER_01: So in this talk, we're sharing our thoughts on the benefits and cautions of bringing attention
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_01: to the words you use, the dilemmas of bypass and judgment, and how we both come to acknowledge
[0:01:32] SPEAKER_01: that we can heal our conditioning through love and through making different choices.

[0:02:09] SPEAKER_01: Just a note, next week I will be in Canada completing a training in a program called
[0:02:14] SPEAKER_01: DNRS, which you may have heard us mention before.
[0:02:18] SPEAKER_01: So there will be no new episode next week.
[0:02:21] SPEAKER_01: I am, however, really looking forward to bringing back some stories and wisdom to tell you
[0:02:26] SPEAKER_01: about my experiences.
[0:02:28] SPEAKER_01: Lastly, you all know that sometimes we can curse on the show and even though I think
[0:02:33] SPEAKER_01: we were actually very clean in this episode, if you're in mixed non-swearing company,
[0:02:38] SPEAKER_01: you may want to pop in some headphones just in case.
[0:02:42] Unknown: Okay everyone, here we go.
[0:02:46] Unknown: Hello Vanessa.
[0:02:48] SPEAKER_00: Hello Brooke.
[0:02:50] SPEAKER_00: It's nice to see you on the other side of Thanksgiving holiday times.
[0:02:54] Unknown: Did you have a nice holiday?
[0:02:57] SPEAKER_00: So good.
[0:02:58] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have a good big old friendsgiving, so super sweet.
[0:03:02] Unknown: You?
[0:03:04] SPEAKER_01: Oh my gosh, I got sunshine and beach and palm trees and a real chance to practice being
[0:03:10] SPEAKER_01: non-codependent, so how wonderful.
[0:03:12] SPEAKER_00: I think you're probably not alone in that, except for people like me who skip that entirely
[0:03:17] SPEAKER_00: and just hang with a whole giant group of friends.
[0:03:21] SPEAKER_00: That's the Ninja Warrior level of avoiding codependency.
[0:03:29] SPEAKER_00: So actually post-Thanksgiving is a good time to have this conversation because we're full
[0:03:34] SPEAKER_00: swing in the holiday season now, which most of us conceive of, experience or talk about
[0:03:40] Unknown: as like a high-pressured stress time.
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_00: Me personally, in my practice, I've been playing a lot with or noticing at least how I use
[0:03:53] Unknown: language unconsciously to create my experience of reality.
[0:04:01] Unknown: So when we spoke with David Thomas, he did an exquisite job of pointing to us as creators
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_00: and he was talking about way more than just this, just what I'm pointing out, but language
[0:04:13] SPEAKER_00: has been a way in for me lately of noticing it.
[0:04:16] Unknown: So what I'm talking about specifically are I'll use language in ways where I notice that
[0:04:24] Unknown: I'm complaining, projecting worries into the future, lots of judging myself, judging the
[0:04:36] SPEAKER_00: world, basically ways that just don't feel good, aren't yummy perspectives on things.
[0:04:41] SPEAKER_00: And in the past, I've really bristled at anything that indicates like turn that frown upside
[0:04:49] Unknown: down kind of thinking.
[0:04:52] Unknown: And there is a lot out there around language that winds up being very bright sighting,
[0:05:00] SPEAKER_00: very bypass and very censoring of the experience of the self.
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_00: Like you're feeling a bad feeling.
[0:05:07] SPEAKER_00: Don't feel that bad feeling.
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_00: You don't say bad things.
[0:05:11] SPEAKER_00: Cancel clear.
[0:05:12] SPEAKER_00: Say the good thing.
[0:05:13] SPEAKER_00: That sort of thing.
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, I bristled against this for many, many reasons in part childhood condition.
[0:05:20] SPEAKER_00: Like I grew up in a household, don't think I'm alone here, where if I felt a negative
[0:05:25] SPEAKER_00: emotion to my mother, that meant she was failing at parenting.
[0:05:29] SPEAKER_00: So anytime, even if something really upsetting would happen, don't be sad, don't be angry,
[0:05:34] SPEAKER_00: don't be blah, blah, blah.
[0:05:37] SPEAKER_00: Please be the happy, content, successful object so that I can be considered a good
[0:05:43] SPEAKER_00: mom.
[0:05:44] SPEAKER_00: And I don't mean that in a disparaging way towards my mom.
[0:05:46] Unknown: That's just a very common mother child pattern culturally.
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_00: So anyway, that's why I've avoided it.
[0:05:55] SPEAKER_00: But the holiday season, I can hear it in myself.
[0:06:01] SPEAKER_00: I quite like the holiday season.
[0:06:03] SPEAKER_00: I don't have a lot that I bristle against, but I have a client-based business.
[0:06:08] SPEAKER_00: And so I'll hear with clients or I'll hear out in the community a lot of languaging that
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, wow, why are we all so like, we're such bummers in advance.
[0:06:15] SPEAKER_00: We're so hard on ourselves and hard on this season in advance.
[0:06:21] SPEAKER_00: So I was at my gym last night and my teacher who I love everything about my gym.
[0:06:29] SPEAKER_00: I love it there.
[0:06:31] SPEAKER_00: It is a magical paradise, including the teacher who's delight.
[0:06:34] SPEAKER_00: Like she's such a little ray of sunshine.
[0:06:37] SPEAKER_00: And so at the beginning of the class, as she was welcoming us all in, even she, like just
[0:06:42] Unknown: because it's the culture habit, she was saying, what were her words?
[0:06:49] Unknown: Something like, you guys, you made it through Thanksgiving and you got yourselves in here
[0:06:56] SPEAKER_00: and you got this moment to take care of yourself before you have to rally again and squeeze
[0:07:03] SPEAKER_00: yourself through the rest of the holiday season and you can do it.
[0:07:07] SPEAKER_00: Right. And like, this is very common.
[0:07:09] SPEAKER_00: It's and it's intended as encouragement.
[0:07:11] Unknown: And I just want to say again, she is a delight.
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_00: But because I've been playing with language and myself and also because I came off of
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_00: a really spectacular Thanksgiving with a loving group of friends, it's like definitely a
[0:07:24] SPEAKER_00: paradise experience for me every time we do Thanksgiving.
[0:07:28] Unknown: It's like, OK, another way this could be said is you just had a holiday and now here we
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_00: are together and soon we're going to have another holiday.
[0:07:41] SPEAKER_00: And so none of those things are sensory.
[0:07:43] Unknown: Like none of those things are.
[0:07:47] SPEAKER_00: What would be the bright side examples of that?
[0:07:50] SPEAKER_00: Like. I hope you all better have enjoyed your Thanksgiving and now you're going to work
[0:07:57] SPEAKER_00: out and you're going to love it and then you're going to get on up and you're going to get
[0:08:02] SPEAKER_00: out there and you're going to crush it for Christmas and Hanukkah.
[0:08:05] SPEAKER_00: Right. Like that has this like opposite end of the spectrum.
[0:08:09] SPEAKER_00: But we can just say things not in blank slate neutral, but just where there's openness.
[0:08:16] SPEAKER_00: Like, can we play with can we first of all notice the way language maybe closes our experience
[0:08:21] Unknown: of how we're relating to the world?
[0:08:25] SPEAKER_00: And can we play with it in a way that's not censoring ourselves, not bright side in ourselves,
[0:08:32] Unknown: not cheerleading.
[0:08:34] SPEAKER_00: But does create an experience of openness of the emotions I've been playing with the
[0:08:42] SPEAKER_00: most not emotions qualities I've been playing with are like.
[0:08:46] Unknown: Wonder curiosity interest.
[0:08:51] SPEAKER_00: So if something happens that's frustrating, I'm not saying like, hey, I'm going to learn
[0:08:56] SPEAKER_00: something great from this.
[0:08:57] SPEAKER_00: It's more just like that that happened and I feel this way.
[0:09:01] SPEAKER_00: That's so interesting.
[0:09:03] SPEAKER_00: I wonder what's going on.
[0:09:05] SPEAKER_00: I'm so curious about this.
[0:09:08] SPEAKER_00: So it has this kind of openness and this moving towards without shutting down and without
[0:09:12] SPEAKER_00: shoving ourselves into a big grin.
[0:09:15] SPEAKER_00: So that is a big mouthful.
[0:09:16] Unknown: But that's something I'm playing with in my own practice right now.
[0:09:22] Unknown: Well, if we think about the container of how are we shaping or influencing our experience
[0:09:30] Unknown: of reality, language being one thing, that's where I think you and I have become increasingly
[0:09:37] SPEAKER_01: curious.
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_01: I don't know where it began.
[0:09:39] SPEAKER_01: We always seem to be synchronized.
[0:09:41] SPEAKER_01: In fact, you all seem to be synchronized with us, too.
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_00: So I guess we're all on the journey together.
[0:09:45] SPEAKER_00: We're all dealing with this with language and viewpoint and perspective and perspective.
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_01: And essentially, like, where is our attention and energy going?
[0:09:55] SPEAKER_01: You know, like even our energy and the words we choose and form and our attention, like
[0:10:01] SPEAKER_01: what part of a story are we focusing on?
[0:10:04] SPEAKER_01: What part of language are we focusing on?
[0:10:07] SPEAKER_01: So all of those things.
[0:10:08] SPEAKER_01: And I was just like you.
[0:10:10] SPEAKER_01: I mean, maybe in some way, since we're all so empathic and intuitive, we're picking up
[0:10:17] SPEAKER_01: on the dilemma in the culture and we're bringing the medicine through.
[0:10:22] SPEAKER_01: So maybe at a certain point, because people were so into the bright side, like, no, you
[0:10:27] SPEAKER_01: have to speak it like it's already a reality and everything's so positive.
[0:10:31] SPEAKER_01: There was such an ignoring of the pain and the shadow aspect that maybe a lot of us empaths
[0:10:38] SPEAKER_01: and intuitives were bringing through.
[0:10:40] SPEAKER_01: No, no, no.
[0:10:41] SPEAKER_01: You can't just deny what's there, right?
[0:10:44] SPEAKER_01: You have to meet it.
[0:10:47] SPEAKER_01: But perhaps we're coming to a new place where it's like, OK, I mean, we've met it.
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_01: We've done it.
[0:10:54] SPEAKER_01: I've met my pain over and over again.
[0:10:57] SPEAKER_01: I've met my shadow over and over again.
[0:10:59] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:11:00] SPEAKER_01: I've gone down into the depths of despair.
[0:11:02] Unknown: I've climbed up, you know, flown around heaven.
[0:11:06] SPEAKER_01: And maybe now we can have a different relationship towards this idea of shifting language and
[0:11:12] SPEAKER_01: shifting attention towards.
[0:11:15] Unknown: See, I even hate to say it, towards positive.
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_01: That's what I was going to say.
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_01: And I don't even like saying it.
[0:11:22] Unknown: That's how wired in it is.
[0:11:25] SPEAKER_01: So I think the whole thing is interesting.
[0:11:27] SPEAKER_01: It is still a work in progress for me.
[0:11:30] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I don't know what this is.
[0:11:33] SPEAKER_01: Even when do you remember when that movie came out?
[0:11:35] SPEAKER_01: I think it was called something like Messages in Water.
[0:11:38] SPEAKER_01: No, it was that Japanese.
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_01: So there was a Japanese researcher didn't see it, but I know it.
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:11:44] SPEAKER_01: Oh, it was really beautiful.
[0:11:45] SPEAKER_01: And they would show like freeze frame images of I'm going to say this wrong, but they were
[0:11:51] SPEAKER_01: taking pictures of water, but it's not just a regular picture.
[0:11:56] SPEAKER_01: And they would show the crystalline nature of the molecules of water and how they would
[0:12:01] SPEAKER_01: change based on what someone said to them.
[0:12:05] SPEAKER_01: Or let's say they took a picture and they put the words love around it or they took
[0:12:08] SPEAKER_01: a picture and they put I hate you around it, that they would show that the molecules of
[0:12:14] SPEAKER_01: water would take a different shape.
[0:12:16] Unknown: And it really like it looked almost like a snowflake.
[0:12:22] SPEAKER_01: You know, it would take a different pattern.
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_01: But whenever there were these negative words coming to the water, it would take a really
[0:12:27] SPEAKER_01: like the color would be off.
[0:12:29] SPEAKER_01: It would look very dysregulated, very chaotic pattern.
[0:12:32] SPEAKER_01: And whenever there were these beautiful words shared with the water, it would take a beautiful
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_01: symmetrical like gorgeous snowflake like pattern.
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_01: And I mean, when you watch it, it's pretty freaking impressive.
[0:12:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's amazing.
[0:12:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:12:46] Unknown: And yet, you know, I still am going to talk like, you know, poorly to myself or you still
[0:12:53] SPEAKER_01: find yourself caught in language loops.
[0:12:55] SPEAKER_01: It's almost like when I saw that movie, it's like, wow, that's so impressive.
[0:12:59] Unknown: And it was like it was a fairy tale or something like I still couldn't grasp that that's reality,
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: that it's as real as, you know, when I knock on my wood desk.
[0:13:10] SPEAKER_01: Do you know what I mean by that?
[0:13:12] SPEAKER_00: I do.
[0:13:13] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:13:14] SPEAKER_00: And it makes me think about Suzanne Seagal's book, which has been very meaningful to me,
[0:13:20] SPEAKER_00: Collision with the Infinite.
[0:13:22] SPEAKER_00: And she's a she's no longer living, but she was a psychologist, therapist who worked in
[0:13:29] SPEAKER_00: private practice.
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_00: And she had the stories about her awakening experience.
[0:13:32] Unknown: So she was awake.
[0:13:35] SPEAKER_00: She talks about her conundrum almost of like being in private practice in a field that's
[0:13:41] Unknown: been trained to glorify suffering.
[0:13:45] SPEAKER_00: And you and I've talked about this before, but that, you know, if we're talking about
[0:13:49] SPEAKER_00: our suffering, then wow, something really meaningful is happening.
[0:13:55] SPEAKER_00: A meaningful exchange of intimacy is happening.
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_00: If we're talking about our suffering or sharing our darkness or complaining.
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_00: And I have no problem with all those things.
[0:14:05] SPEAKER_00: And I'm glad that my friends and I can share those things.
[0:14:08] SPEAKER_00: But why do we decide that's the meaningful intimacy?
[0:14:13] SPEAKER_00: Why is it less meaningful when I, like this weekend, go on a hike with a group of friends
[0:14:20] Unknown: and they're like, how's your life?
[0:14:22] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, it's so good.
[0:14:23] SPEAKER_00: I'm really, really enjoying this phase of my life.
[0:14:28] SPEAKER_00: If I could imagine being a 90 year old and wanting to chime travel to any period of my
[0:14:34] Unknown: life, it would be like 5pm to 9pm any night when I'm at home with August, my son.
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_00: It's just paradise.
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_00: It's cooking, it's talking, it's watching TV.
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_00: That's my idea of heaven.
[0:14:51] Unknown: Sharing that with my friends on the hike, that's deep intimacy too.
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_00: Not just, oh, this is what I'm struggling with.
[0:15:00] SPEAKER_00: This is what's hard right now.
[0:15:03] SPEAKER_00: And there is this habit in culture that if we're sharing the hard stuff or complaining,
[0:15:12] SPEAKER_00: then we're really bonding.
[0:15:14] SPEAKER_00: Real intimacy is happening.
[0:15:15] SPEAKER_01: Well, when I went to school for psychology, if you were sharing the hard stuff or looking
[0:15:21] SPEAKER_01: at the hard stuff, you were also considered very valuable.
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_01: You were doing the work.
[0:15:26] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_01: If I didn't have anything going on, it was like, okay, someone's not connected.
[0:15:33] SPEAKER_00: It reminds me of the Seinfeld episode where George learned that he could keep getting
[0:15:37] SPEAKER_00: promoted at work and everyone think he was amazing.
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_00: If he would just do these deep, exasperated sighs all the time and rub his forehead and
[0:15:46] Unknown: move papers around angrily, they would be like, well, that guy must be really, don't
[0:15:51] SPEAKER_00: bother him.
[0:15:52] SPEAKER_00: He's really crushing it.
[0:15:53] SPEAKER_00: He must really be working.
[0:15:54] SPEAKER_00: Give that guy a promotion.
[0:15:55] SPEAKER_00: Like we do this in life too.
[0:15:59] SPEAKER_00: It's really funny.
[0:16:00] SPEAKER_00: George Costanza, spiritual teacher.
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_01: Well, I love it.
[0:16:06] SPEAKER_01: He's had a few lessons.
[0:16:07] SPEAKER_01: We've quoted him on the show before.
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_01: So he in fact keeps delivering.
[0:16:12] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[0:16:13] SPEAKER_01: Here's what I wanted to get at with that is the energetics.
[0:16:16] SPEAKER_01: So again, I'm a Chinese medicine practitioner by background.
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_01: I was doing energy medicine called acupuncture.
[0:16:24] SPEAKER_01: That's what it is.
[0:16:25] SPEAKER_01: And yet it's still been a shift for me to experience the world of energy as as real
[0:16:31] SPEAKER_01: as the material concrete world, right?
[0:16:35] SPEAKER_01: Like the quantum physics to be as real as the Newtonian physics.
[0:16:39] SPEAKER_01: And I can like it conceptually, but I mean really to get like, this is real.
[0:16:45] SPEAKER_01: And so if you speak with your friends and you're bonding about something painful, that's
[0:16:50] SPEAKER_01: wonderful and everything.
[0:16:52] SPEAKER_01: That's a beautiful movement, but there's an energy dynamic that can happen, especially
[0:16:57] SPEAKER_01: if it's done repetitively.
[0:16:58] SPEAKER_01: If you're sharing a beautiful story, there's an energy dynamic that can happen.
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_01: And I think we're at the phase, I know you and I are Brooke, maybe the culture is beginning
[0:17:07] Unknown: the consciousness culture anyway, to start to recognize the importance of energy, like
[0:17:14] Unknown: the real deep importance of these different kinds of energetic dynamics.
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_01: This time recently, I just shared this thing on Facebook where it was like they had an
[0:17:26] SPEAKER_01: experiment with kids in a school where they had two plants and one of the plants was bullied.
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_01: You know, they were feeding it, I think it was like a recorder with like, I know, I was
[0:17:37] SPEAKER_01: so sad.
[0:17:38] SPEAKER_01: I'm like a plant was harmed in the development of this study.
[0:17:43] SPEAKER_01: And it was like fed with bullying and the other one was fed, you know, I love you, you're
[0:17:47] SPEAKER_01: beautiful, positive affirmations.
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_01: And you watched one of the plants wither.
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_01: Like at base, we're not material beings, we're energetic beings.
[0:17:58] SPEAKER_01: And all of us on the awakening path are awakening to that, not energy per se, but that we are
[0:18:04] SPEAKER_01: made of consciousness.
[0:18:06] Unknown: I don't know how could I put language on it, but we're not this concrete reality we think
[0:18:12] SPEAKER_01: we are.
[0:18:13] SPEAKER_01: Like that was one of the messages I got the other day.
[0:18:16] Unknown: I was tuning into for myself, but I was going within to do a little inquiry with my guides
[0:18:22] SPEAKER_01: on health issues.
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_01: And then they were saying something along the lines of like one of the things you're
[0:18:28] Unknown: running into is you keep thinking your body is concrete.
[0:18:33] SPEAKER_01: And as long as you do, and by that I mean tangible material, right?
[0:18:37] SPEAKER_01: As long as you do, it can't be changed the way it can't be changed in a quantum way,
[0:18:41] SPEAKER_01: it can't be changed rapidly and like completely because there's an idea of time once I think
[0:18:47] SPEAKER_01: of concrete and then how long things take and all of these other things happen.
[0:18:52] Unknown: So I think maybe for you and I, as we've been awakening, we're starting to awaken to, okay,
[0:19:00] SPEAKER_01: we've done a lot of clearing at the emotional level.
[0:19:02] Unknown: We sure have, right?
[0:19:04] SPEAKER_01: We've done a lot of clearing at the somatic level, meeting tensions, releasing them, turning
[0:19:10] SPEAKER_01: towards ourselves.
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_01: But there's this other component of becoming masters at understanding energy and attention
[0:19:21] SPEAKER_01: and perspective that I think you and I are recognizing like, oh, this is the next level
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_01: of evolution.
[0:19:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_00: And when you were talking initially and you said that there's still that recoil to the
[0:19:35] SPEAKER_00: word positive, right?
[0:19:36] SPEAKER_00: Focus on the positive.
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_00: It makes me recoil.
[0:19:38] Unknown: It's like, blah, because I know what those communities look like.
[0:19:44] SPEAKER_00: And I know the outcomes too.
[0:19:46] SPEAKER_00: Usually people feel more shame about their humanity on the other side, which is why it
[0:19:51] Unknown: gives me such a visceral response.
[0:19:55] SPEAKER_00: And yet what I didn't realize was I was going through this process of basically deconditioning
[0:20:00] SPEAKER_00: the self, deconditioning my thoughts, emotions, body, and I'm still engaged in that process.
[0:20:08] SPEAKER_00: But there was enough of a softening agent over time that at a certain point there is
[0:20:13] SPEAKER_00: something else.
[0:20:15] SPEAKER_00: And it turns out the something else is this creator nature, which David Thomas had pointed
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_00: to very clearly many of the teachers we've spoken to have, but he just really honed in
[0:20:25] SPEAKER_00: on that in our conversation with him.
[0:20:28] Unknown: And then it starts to become fun because you can play.
[0:20:32] SPEAKER_00: And actually we're both obsessed with this book right now, Waking Up in 5D, Maureen Saint
[0:20:37] SPEAKER_00: Germain.
[0:20:38] SPEAKER_00: You put it in the show notes.
[0:20:39] SPEAKER_00: I did it.
[0:20:40] Unknown: I remembered.
[0:20:41] SPEAKER_00: And there was a passage in there very briefly where she said she had gotten information
[0:20:48] SPEAKER_00: about that there was such a thing as like living karma free and that she was like, what?
[0:20:54] SPEAKER_00: What does that even mean?
[0:20:55] SPEAKER_00: And she had to kind of sit with it.
[0:20:57] SPEAKER_00: And whatever, like that's a whole other conversation if we want to break down what does that even
[0:21:02] SPEAKER_00: mean?
[0:21:03] SPEAKER_00: What is karma?
[0:21:04] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to go there.
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_00: The point being, let's say, just as a something to get curious about, that it's possible for
[0:21:14] SPEAKER_00: there to be enough healing to have happened that there is the land of healed.
[0:21:20] Unknown: Right?
[0:21:22] SPEAKER_00: We're still alive.
[0:21:23] SPEAKER_00: We're still responding to our lives in the full spectrum of human emotions.
[0:21:27] SPEAKER_00: And we pointed at this some in our last episode, our hundredth episode.
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_00: But the creator aspect is what is able to come online.
[0:21:35] SPEAKER_00: Because if I had tried to force that in myself when I was still, let's say, really dense,
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_00: physically dense, as in gripping and hard tissue wise, and mentally dense, and really
[0:21:49] SPEAKER_00: still believing all of my conditioning and my belief systems, the only way I could change
[0:21:55] SPEAKER_00: my language would be to force myself to do something that I didn't have any experiential
[0:22:01] SPEAKER_00: access to.
[0:22:02] Unknown: So, of course, it would create more density in myself, more shame based thoughts.
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_00: Why can't I?
[0:22:10] SPEAKER_00: You know, why can't I just think positively?
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_00: Why can't I just be nobody likes me?
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm such a downer, blah, blah, blah.
[0:22:17] SPEAKER_00: But now that that's softened so much, I can be a lot more playful.
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_00: And I'm discovering that language is one of the main places where that can happen.
[0:22:29] SPEAKER_00: So I'm watching habits like you were talking about.
[0:22:33] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes with a friend sharing something challenging or something painful is, of course,
[0:22:37] SPEAKER_00: very intimate and very genuine, but that we can create a pattern.
[0:22:42] SPEAKER_00: I think many, most of us can think about certain friendships where maybe they got wired together
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_00: that way, where you're the people who complain together.
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_00: And recently, there's a friend who I haven't seen in a couple years, because she and I
[0:22:58] SPEAKER_00: came together at a time a bunch of years ago where we would like come together and complain.
[0:23:04] SPEAKER_00: And you know, then at a certain point, I just kind of needed to release that friendship,
[0:23:08] SPEAKER_00: not in a dramatic breakup way.
[0:23:10] SPEAKER_00: But we just didn't spend time together.
[0:23:11] SPEAKER_00: Now we don't live in the same town anymore.
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_00: We ran into each other at Trader Joe's.
[0:23:16] SPEAKER_00: And it was fascinating to watch me because I saw her, I was thrilled to see her, love
[0:23:21] Unknown: her.
[0:23:22] Unknown: And it's like I started to boot up complaining language very quickly.
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_00: And you know, we're moms, so oftentimes it can be very easy, but kids, oh my God, the
[0:23:32] SPEAKER_00: grocery store is so busy today.
[0:23:34] SPEAKER_00: I know it's so crazy.
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_00: I can't believe Thanksgiving's next week.
[0:23:36] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God, I'm running around all the time.
[0:23:39] SPEAKER_00: And so she and I start going back and forth about how crazy busy everything is.
[0:23:42] Unknown: And I can catch myself and just I started to soften the language.
[0:23:49] SPEAKER_00: The truth of the matter is everything I just said before.
[0:23:52] SPEAKER_00: This is far and away one of the most pleasurable time periods of my life.
[0:23:59] Unknown: And the conversation slowed down.
[0:24:02] SPEAKER_00: We're not speaking like people who are so, it's so busy.
[0:24:06] SPEAKER_00: Everything's so stressful.
[0:24:08] SPEAKER_00: And there starts to be more intimacy in the way that we're talking about our kids.
[0:24:12] SPEAKER_00: So instead of like, oh, he's doing blah, blah, blah activity and I'm taking him over to blah,
[0:24:16] SPEAKER_00: blah, blah.
[0:24:18] Unknown: Oh, God, it's so sweet to watch them become their own people.
[0:24:23] Unknown: It's so sweet to watch them discover long term friendships that they really care about.
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_00: It's so sweet.
[0:24:32] SPEAKER_00: So those are the kinds of moments where I didn't have to force myself to be like, well,
[0:24:37] SPEAKER_00: look on the bright side, you know, the good news is we got healthy kids.
[0:24:42] SPEAKER_00: Like that's I wasn't forcing us or shaming us about something.
[0:24:46] SPEAKER_00: There was access to a different kind of relating, different kind of language.
[0:24:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I had a friend who was I think she used to listen to Abraham Hicks a lot and, you know,
[0:24:57] SPEAKER_01: all of those like so she would think about the energy of the words and everything,
[0:25:02] SPEAKER_01: which I agree with.
[0:25:03] SPEAKER_01: But if you said something that she thought wasn't in alignment with energy and words
[0:25:08] SPEAKER_01: that was positive for you, she would be like the language police, like, don't say that.
[0:25:12] SPEAKER_00: Right. Which is all fear, right?
[0:25:13] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that already interjected its own energy dynamic.
[0:25:17] SPEAKER_01: It's not the word, it's the energy.
[0:25:19] SPEAKER_00: Right. Be careful.
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_01: Don't screw up your life.
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_01: You're doing it wrong.
[0:25:22] SPEAKER_00: I feel much better now.
[0:25:23] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[0:25:24] SPEAKER_01: You have now manifested.
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_01: So I'm like, oh, no, if we believe the energy is the root, because that's all that we're
[0:25:31] SPEAKER_01: talking about is the power of consciousness to create something.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: Then let's just slow down the word police thing.
[0:25:40] Unknown: But it's funny, Mario and I were flying home from Florida Saturday and it was a tough week.
[0:25:49] SPEAKER_01: My dad was in the hospital, so him and my mom were doing their dynamics and like he
[0:25:54] SPEAKER_01: was in pain.
[0:25:55] SPEAKER_01: And so there was just a lot of energy hanging off the walls.
[0:25:59] SPEAKER_01: That's what I mean by a tough week for this person to deal with that level of energetic
[0:26:04] SPEAKER_01: stimulation.
[0:26:06] SPEAKER_01: It puts me in a challenge zone.
[0:26:08] SPEAKER_01: But I did very well with the challenge.
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_01: But by the end of the week, I can feel myself fatiguing.
[0:26:14] SPEAKER_01: That's usually what happens.
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_01: It's like I start to fatigue.
[0:26:17] SPEAKER_01: So we're on the plane and we're half hour delayed and then we get onto the tarmac and
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_01: then we're delayed again, another 45 minutes.
[0:26:25] SPEAKER_01: You're just sitting in the plane, that whole thing.
[0:26:29] SPEAKER_01: So Mario starts to get a little crabby.
[0:26:31] SPEAKER_01: He's like, I'm starting to get real crabby.
[0:26:33] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, no, no, no.
[0:26:35] SPEAKER_01: You know what?
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it sucks.
[0:26:37] SPEAKER_01: But the truth is we got TVs.
[0:26:39] SPEAKER_01: We were just in Florida for a week.
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_01: We're heading to our beautiful home.
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_01: It's fine.
[0:26:45] SPEAKER_01: It's really fine.
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_01: And I felt that.
[0:26:48] SPEAKER_01: That was true.
[0:26:48] SPEAKER_01: It wasn't a bypass.
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_01: In any moment, there's a million things happening.
[0:26:52] SPEAKER_01: So in that moment, there was one frustrating thing happening, but there was also good
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_01: things happening.
[0:26:57] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm sitting with my honey.
[0:26:59] SPEAKER_01: I just got to spend a week with my parents.
[0:27:01] SPEAKER_01: All of these good things are happening.
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_01: And then when we get to the airport and there was this whole other transportation issue
[0:27:07] SPEAKER_01: at the airport and now like we're both starting to wear thin and we're like complaining about
[0:27:12] SPEAKER_01: how the airport didn't handle it right.
[0:27:14] SPEAKER_01: And the transportation.
[0:27:15] SPEAKER_01: And finally, I was like, I am so sick of complaining.
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_01: The reality is we went on a beautiful vacation and we're getting home fine.
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_01: I can't even complain about this anymore.
[0:27:26] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, can we just stop complaining?
[0:27:28] SPEAKER_01: And he was like, OK.
[0:27:30] Unknown: My God, this feels better.
[0:27:33] SPEAKER_01: I don't even know what the point is serving anymore.
[0:27:35] SPEAKER_01: And that's when you see those habitual loops like nothing.
[0:27:39] SPEAKER_01: This is like a mental masturbation at a certain point.
[0:27:41] SPEAKER_01: It's not like I'm complaining to the transportation authority who can change something.
[0:27:46] Unknown: I'm just complaining for 30 minutes about how wrong everybody is.
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_01: You know, and it was a relief.
[0:27:56] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's the interesting thing is it's it's not a bypass.
[0:28:01] SPEAKER_01: It's a shift of attention a little bit.
[0:28:04] SPEAKER_01: Is there anything it can do here in this moment?
[0:28:08] SPEAKER_01: Is there some way to address the problem?
[0:28:09] SPEAKER_01: Well, then I will speak to the correct person and file my grievance.
[0:28:14] SPEAKER_01: But if not, what's the energy I'm left with?
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm just working myself up into a bad mood to feel what?
[0:28:22] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:28:23] Unknown: Righteous, justified.
[0:28:26] SPEAKER_01: I don't know whatever the case may be.
[0:28:29] Unknown: So I thought it was really interesting to see, like, oh, once you start to pay attention to this stuff,
[0:28:36] SPEAKER_01: you know, here we all are.
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_01: We're like, I want to be happy.
[0:28:40] SPEAKER_01: I want to be happy.
[0:28:41] SPEAKER_01: I want to find heaven on earth.
[0:28:42] SPEAKER_01: I want to be awake.
[0:28:43] SPEAKER_01: I want to feel bliss.
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_01: And then we're the ones stirring our own pots and like, yeah, sometimes in innocence.
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_01: But once you start to bring consciousness to it, you'll see how often you're doing it because
[0:28:54] Unknown: there's some secondary agenda.
[0:28:57] Unknown: Like everyone in my family, my parents mostly were just, you know, they were having a rough week.
[0:29:01] SPEAKER_01: So they were taking turns being in kind of crabby moods.
[0:29:05] SPEAKER_01: And I would do the best I can to be with them, give them some space and then bring a little levity.
[0:29:10] SPEAKER_01: And we would sue through it.
[0:29:11] SPEAKER_01: And then I found myself, I don't know, whatever day it was, maybe by Friday being like,
[0:29:16] SPEAKER_01: now I want to be in a crabby mood.
[0:29:18] SPEAKER_01: My turn.
[0:29:19] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:29:20] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, my turn.
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_01: What's good about being in a crabby mood?
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_01: What's good about being in a crabby mood?
[0:29:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_01: What is it I think I'm getting out of it?
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_01: And maybe that woman, Maureen St. Germain, when she was talking about language,
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_01: she was talking about whining.
[0:29:33] SPEAKER_01: And she said that whining is like a form of self-validation or a seeking of self-validation.
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_01: So I can be like, isn't this shitty that my parents don't feel well and I'm like tired.
[0:29:44] SPEAKER_01: And you could be like, it sure is Vanessa.
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, ah, myself got validated.
[0:29:49] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:29:50] SPEAKER_01: So I don't know what it is, but for the first time, I'm starting to have like such a keen
[0:29:55] SPEAKER_01: awareness of it.
[0:29:56] SPEAKER_01: Like, look at the choice you're making.
[0:29:59] SPEAKER_01: See, I think what you were saying earlier was important, Brooke.
[0:30:02] SPEAKER_01: Like there was a stage, it wasn't a choice.
[0:30:04] SPEAKER_01: There was so much density, so much patterning that the only thing I could do was turn to it,
[0:30:09] SPEAKER_01: meet it and bring love.
[0:30:11] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:30:11] SPEAKER_00: And that's a scenario.
[0:30:12] SPEAKER_01: Bring love in my case.
[0:30:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Right.
[0:30:15] SPEAKER_01: Like that was the goal.
[0:30:16] SPEAKER_00: On a good day.
[0:30:16] SPEAKER_01: That was the aspiration.
[0:30:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:30:18] Unknown: And now there's so much more openness and spaciousness that I can see like, oh, I have
[0:30:26] SPEAKER_01: a choice right now.
[0:30:28] SPEAKER_01: I can cling to my turn to be in a bad mood or I could just let that go.
[0:30:37] SPEAKER_01: And it may take a little bit to let it go, but not that much.
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: Not what I would have thought it would have taken.
[0:30:43] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:30:44] SPEAKER_00: It's not a heavy lift.
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_00: No.
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_00: To see it a different way.
[0:30:48] Unknown: And this is where language being a tangible thing, because it's like we're checking our
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_00: math, right?
[0:30:57] SPEAKER_00: We can hear what comes out of our mouths.
[0:31:00] SPEAKER_00: It becomes made into form.
[0:31:04] SPEAKER_00: You know, me ruminating about something I might miss, right?
[0:31:06] SPEAKER_00: Like I might go off and start thinking about something else and miss that I spent 30
[0:31:10] SPEAKER_00: minutes thinking about how I suffer more than anyone else on the planet, you know?
[0:31:13] SPEAKER_00: That easily could happen.
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_00: But as soon as I start putting language to things, if I can tune my awareness to hear
[0:31:20] SPEAKER_00: the kinds of things that are coming out of my mouth, or sometimes the thought patterns
[0:31:24] SPEAKER_00: you have, but coming out of your mouth is handy because it is and it's usually with
[0:31:29] SPEAKER_00: another, right?
[0:31:29] SPEAKER_00: So there's a relational aspect too.
[0:31:33] SPEAKER_00: It gives me information.
[0:31:34] SPEAKER_00: And so just to go over a few tangible things to play with for people listening who want
[0:31:39] SPEAKER_00: to play with these as inquiries.
[0:31:43] Unknown: Some of the shifts I had mentioned wonder.
[0:31:49] SPEAKER_00: And this also comes from the book from Maureen Saint-Germain.
[0:31:52] SPEAKER_00: She had talked about an example of like, why?
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_00: Why did I lose my keys?
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_00: Or like, why is this happening?
[0:31:59] SPEAKER_00: Why blah, blah, blah?
[0:32:01] SPEAKER_00: Why is a go look for the problem, go look and find the problem.
[0:32:05] Unknown: Whereas I wonder, huh, I wonder, I lost my keys.
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_00: I wonder what's going on.
[0:32:12] SPEAKER_00: Or like, that's interesting.
[0:32:14] Unknown: I wonder what's up.
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_00: It just has a much more like open handed approach of curiosity as opposed to like heat seeking
[0:32:22] SPEAKER_00: missile, find the problem.
[0:32:25] Unknown: And what are some other ones that I've been using with myself?
[0:32:29] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I'll notice that a lot of times I'll say internally or externally, I'll say,
[0:32:34] SPEAKER_00: internally or externally, I have to and it has this very laborious quality.
[0:32:40] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I have to email my clients about tomorrow's appointment reminders.
[0:32:46] Unknown: It's like a very simple change.
[0:32:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying I don't have that task and I'm not bright siding and saying,
[0:32:53] SPEAKER_00: I love that I have an abundant practice.
[0:32:56] SPEAKER_00: Like, I could just simply say, I'm going to.
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to email my clients and remind them about tomorrow's appointments.
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_00: It's just a middle place way of saying the same thing.
[0:33:08] Unknown: If it's true, I will say, I want to or I look forward to only if it's true.
[0:33:14] SPEAKER_00: Or I choose to.
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_00: Or I choose to.
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_00: I choose to.
[0:33:18] SPEAKER_00: The most neutral is just, I'm going to.
[0:33:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to email my clients about tomorrow.
[0:33:22] SPEAKER_00: But I can, should or have to about like something like an errand, you know,
[0:33:30] SPEAKER_00: I have to go grocery shopping.
[0:33:32] SPEAKER_00: I should go grocery shopping.
[0:33:34] SPEAKER_00: And when it comes out of my mouth, is that true?
[0:33:37] SPEAKER_00: Or is there a like, I want to.
[0:33:39] SPEAKER_00: The truth of the matter is like, I want to.
[0:33:42] SPEAKER_00: I actually look forward to.
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_00: I love going and buying food and planning out food for the week.
[0:33:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to.
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_00: I want to.
[0:33:49] SPEAKER_00: I look forward to.
[0:33:50] Unknown: And it changes my experience of the way that I'm moving through my whole life.
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_00: These aren't just phrases.
[0:33:56] Unknown: It's then how the approach is and the continuity of the experience throughout.
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_00: What is my experience then of going grocery shopping or of emailing clients or of.
[0:34:10] SPEAKER_00: Your spells.
[0:34:11] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:34:12] SPEAKER_01: Because as soon as we say I have to, the message we're giving back to this body mind is,
[0:34:19] SPEAKER_01: I am a servant of, I am obligated, I am under the burden of.
[0:34:23] SPEAKER_01: But if we say I want to, I choose to, I'm lucky enough to, I'm invited to,
[0:34:29] SPEAKER_01: you know, if we switch that, then again, the message we're giving back ourselves is,
[0:34:33] SPEAKER_01: I'm an active creator.
[0:34:35] SPEAKER_01: I'm an active participant.
[0:34:37] SPEAKER_01: I have choice.
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: And so it's just a whole different internal experience.
[0:34:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:34:42] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I come from a family culture, again, quite sure I'm not alone here,
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_00: where it's like.
[0:34:48] SPEAKER_00: You're here to function.
[0:34:51] SPEAKER_00: Like your primary objective is function your way through life.
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_00: So that's, and that's very common culturally.
[0:34:58] SPEAKER_00: I have to, right?
[0:35:00] SPEAKER_00: I have to go to work.
[0:35:01] SPEAKER_00: I have to clean the house.
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_00: I have to, it's like lug yourself through your life.
[0:35:08] SPEAKER_00: And that's the best that you get as a human being.
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_00: And this is all totally unconscious patterning in themselves and in me.
[0:35:17] SPEAKER_00: And so as soon as I'm no longer just the obvious person,
[0:35:20] SPEAKER_00: the object that needs to drag itself through tasks of functionality,
[0:35:25] SPEAKER_00: suddenly I'm having a life that I can delight in and enjoy in its most ordinary moments
[0:35:35] SPEAKER_00: and in its most exquisite moments.
[0:35:39] SPEAKER_00: All of the above get to actually be experienced as the experiencer instead of the one
[0:35:45] SPEAKER_00: getting it over with, you know, getting the tasks of functionality
[0:35:49] SPEAKER_00: checked off on the to-do list.
[0:35:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:35:54] SPEAKER_01: Remember when we did the episode on co-dependence,
[0:35:56] SPEAKER_01: we were talking about working with people like in a helping capacity
[0:36:01] Unknown: and that if you were suffering under the delusional belief system,
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_01: that you were obligated to do something,
[0:36:11] SPEAKER_01: that you were responsible to do something,
[0:36:15] SPEAKER_01: then when you help people, there were,
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_01: there's always this certain level of energetic drag to it.
[0:36:20] SPEAKER_01: Like, I have to help people.
[0:36:24] Unknown: And yet once you realize that you're not under obligation,
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_01: that you are free, that you get to exist just because
[0:36:34] SPEAKER_01: your existence is magnificent and life wants you to exist,
[0:36:38] SPEAKER_01: then all of a sudden you're like, oh, I choose to help people.
[0:36:40] SPEAKER_01: I want to help people.
[0:36:42] SPEAKER_01: And then that energy is extremely different.
[0:36:45] SPEAKER_01: There's no drag on that.
[0:36:47] SPEAKER_01: If anything, you get energy at your back.
[0:36:49] SPEAKER_01: Well, the language is part of what defines the experience
[0:36:53] SPEAKER_01: or at the very least the language can reflect to all of us
[0:36:56] Unknown: which experience we're in so that if I say to someone,
[0:37:00] SPEAKER_01: oh, I have to see my clients, I can get curious.
[0:37:05] Unknown: Like, do I feel obligated?
[0:37:08] SPEAKER_01: Do I feel exhausted?
[0:37:10] SPEAKER_01: Am I just using language habitually?
[0:37:14] SPEAKER_01: What's happening underneath this?
[0:37:16] SPEAKER_01: What's arising?
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_01: And we can get a little closer to maybe some of the patterning
[0:37:21] SPEAKER_01: that wants to be released around it because it's such a clear,
[0:37:26] SPEAKER_01: it's such a clear difference of experience.
[0:37:28] SPEAKER_01: I mean, what's funny is Maureen was saying,
[0:37:30] SPEAKER_01: oh, when you know, in 5D, the language have to
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_01: doesn't fit 5D anymore.
[0:37:34] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, oh, good.
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_01: Well, maybe that's why I've been telling people
[0:37:38] SPEAKER_01: whenever they say you have to do something,
[0:37:39] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, I don't have to do anything.
[0:37:41] SPEAKER_01: I've always said that.
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_01: I don't have to do anything.
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_01: I may tell myself I have to.
[0:37:48] SPEAKER_01: But you don't tell me I have to.
[0:37:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the same thing as she's like, don't, you know,
[0:37:52] SPEAKER_01: aim not to use like judging or blaming language.
[0:37:55] Unknown: And I noticed when someone would say,
[0:37:58] SPEAKER_01: oh, how do you like that?
[0:37:59] SPEAKER_01: If I don't like it, my saying was always,
[0:38:01] SPEAKER_01: that's not my favorite.
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_01: That's right.
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_00: And Mario always used to laugh at me.
[0:38:07] SPEAKER_01: I don't love that.
[0:38:07] SPEAKER_01: That's not my favorite.
[0:38:09] SPEAKER_01: And that's just natural.
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_01: But she was saying, you know, try to shift away from,
[0:38:13] SPEAKER_01: well, that sucks or that's bad or this is, you know,
[0:38:17] SPEAKER_01: because that's just the language of dualism.
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_01: So I think the whole thing is interesting,
[0:38:23] SPEAKER_01: but how do you not make yourself crazy over it?
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_01: You know, I mean, this is, I think,
[0:38:28] SPEAKER_01: where you and I can run into objection
[0:38:30] SPEAKER_01: with a lot of the techniques and tools,
[0:38:32] Unknown: because the fact is, as your consciousness wakes up,
[0:38:36] SPEAKER_01: you naturally do these things.
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_01: And the techniques and tools before your consciousness wakes
[0:38:42] SPEAKER_01: up almost always get used by the ego agenda,
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_01: pulled through the same patterning that you've always run
[0:38:50] SPEAKER_01: and get used as a way to judge yourself,
[0:38:53] SPEAKER_01: blame yourself, judge others, blame others,
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_01: and like collapse into the same emotions
[0:38:58] SPEAKER_01: you've always collapsed into.
[0:39:00] Unknown: So if you're not already curious about this,
[0:39:08] SPEAKER_01: is there any usefulness in trying to become curious
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_01: about your language?
[0:39:11] SPEAKER_01: Do you know what I mean by that?
[0:39:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I do.
[0:39:14] Unknown: I think that it's very useful with any practice that we have,
[0:39:20] SPEAKER_00: meditation, spiritual inquiry, any class we're taking,
[0:39:24] Unknown: anything at all, retreat, to pause and ask ourselves
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_00: at different times as we go through those practices,
[0:39:32] SPEAKER_00: am I using this against myself?
[0:39:34] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, Matt Kahn, who's become a dear friend,
[0:39:36] SPEAKER_00: he's really good at pointing out these tools.
[0:39:39] SPEAKER_00: There are so many things that can be very useful,
[0:39:41] SPEAKER_00: but the ego will always find a way to use it against itself.
[0:39:44] SPEAKER_00: So knowing that we all have very handy ego structures
[0:39:48] Unknown: that are not the enemy, it can be helpful to just pause
[0:39:52] SPEAKER_00: and ask, am I using this against myself?
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_00: So if we play with this language tool, for example,
[0:39:58] SPEAKER_00: the way we know we're using it against ourselves
[0:40:01] SPEAKER_00: is if we feel more shame, more contracted, more anxious,
[0:40:06] SPEAKER_00: we're berating ourselves more, we're more irritated
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_00: with ourselves that we're not a certain way,
[0:40:11] SPEAKER_00: that's proof that we're using it against ourselves.
[0:40:14] Unknown: And so if we discover that, we are in fact using it
[0:40:18] Unknown: against ourselves, first of all, compassion, how human of you.
[0:40:23] Unknown: We all have used very potent spiritual insight
[0:40:28] SPEAKER_00: against ourselves because we have ego structures.
[0:40:30] SPEAKER_00: So first of all, not a problem.
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_00: And then the other thing to do is then instead of sort of
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_00: shoving this down your own throat, you can focus on practices
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_00: that are more like softening agents, whatever works for you.
[0:40:48] SPEAKER_00: So is there a certain kind of somatic meditation
[0:40:50] SPEAKER_00: that really gets in there?
[0:40:51] SPEAKER_00: Have you been doing realization process?
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_00: Is it Lock Kelly's type of awareness inquiries?
[0:40:58] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter what the thing is,
[0:40:59] Unknown: as long as it feels like softening agent,
[0:41:03] Unknown: useful nourishing food and stick with that
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_00: and just know that these things all have their own right timing.
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I've used this example before, but I remember 20 years ago,
[0:41:15] SPEAKER_00: I was at the Tufts craniofacial pain clinic
[0:41:18] SPEAKER_00: because of my issues that I grew up with
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_00: and I couldn't open my mouth and I was just a ball of tension.
[0:41:26] SPEAKER_00: And they pointed out to me that I was breathing
[0:41:28] SPEAKER_00: using only emergency respiration.
[0:41:29] SPEAKER_00: So every time I took a breath, I just used my little scalenes
[0:41:32] SPEAKER_00: and kind of pulled my shoulders up towards my ears
[0:41:35] SPEAKER_00: and my ribs and my diaphragm weren't moving at all.
[0:41:38] Unknown: So they very helpfully tried to teach me how to breathe
[0:41:42] SPEAKER_00: using my diaphragm and my lungs.
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_00: Of course, they were functioning,
[0:41:46] SPEAKER_00: but I was just eking out little bits of breath.
[0:41:49] SPEAKER_00: And then I spent, I don't know, a month using that against myself
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_00: where if I would catch myself doing emergency breath,
[0:41:56] SPEAKER_00: which I did 99% of the time, I would hold my breath
[0:42:01] SPEAKER_00: until I could force myself to breathe in my belly or my rib cage.
[0:42:04] SPEAKER_00: Like that's being harmful towards the self.
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_00: It's a very useful teaching to know how to breathe
[0:42:10] Unknown: in a full unimpeded way.
[0:42:13] SPEAKER_00: But it was too much, too fast.
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_00: And I was just, my conditioning was aggressive, right?
[0:42:20] SPEAKER_00: So I was using it in an aggressive way.
[0:42:24] Unknown: Nowadays, my breath feels really luscious.
[0:42:28] SPEAKER_00: One of my favorite things in the whole wide world to do
[0:42:31] SPEAKER_00: is to sit down or lay down to meditate
[0:42:33] SPEAKER_00: and just feel how luscious breath moving through,
[0:42:38] SPEAKER_00: breath breathing me feels.
[0:42:41] SPEAKER_00: So fun.
[0:42:42] SPEAKER_00: Same person, just a maturation and a softening process.
[0:42:47] SPEAKER_00: So we don't have to force ourselves to be somewhere we're not.
[0:42:51] SPEAKER_00: We're always just looking for what feels useful, functional.
[0:42:59] Unknown: Yeah, I know there's no clear roadmap and there are no clear steps
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_01: and I hate to even put it into language that might imply that.
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_01: But it does seem that quite a bit of tenderness had to be cultivated
[0:43:14] Unknown: or opened within myself to be able to just naturally be like,
[0:43:19] SPEAKER_01: oh my God, that's so curious.
[0:43:20] SPEAKER_01: I just said, had to, or I just spoke about what a victim I am
[0:43:26] SPEAKER_01: of my circumstances for an hour again,
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_01: thereby making whatever people feel bad for me
[0:43:33] SPEAKER_01: or whatever the pattern is.
[0:43:36] SPEAKER_01: I think it's almost like it does have its own natural evolution.
[0:43:42] SPEAKER_01: And I think it is good what you said to check in with the markers.
[0:43:46] SPEAKER_01: Like if this is making you feel more afraid or more ashamed,
[0:43:52] SPEAKER_01: this may not be the right tool for you at this moment.
[0:43:56] SPEAKER_01: Or there's something else that could use some support
[0:44:00] SPEAKER_01: that you can check in on, you know?
[0:44:03] SPEAKER_01: But in a way, it's like maybe that's why you and I both,
[0:44:06] SPEAKER_01: like John Prendergast work so much.
[0:44:08] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, just come into the heart.
[0:44:11] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:44:12] SPEAKER_01: You know, because the thing is, once you can access your heart
[0:44:16] Unknown: and really get into your heart, you just can't be mean to yourself.
[0:44:22] SPEAKER_01: So then you can like play with these things.
[0:44:24] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think that's what you and I are trying to say at this point.
[0:44:28] SPEAKER_01: This is play like, oh, this is so interesting.
[0:44:31] SPEAKER_01: Am I a creator?
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_01: How much is under my own creative capacity?
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_01: How much can I influence my perspective and experience of reality?
[0:44:40] SPEAKER_01: Can I shift the way I feel?
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_01: What happens if I play with language?
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_01: What about the stories I tell?
[0:44:46] SPEAKER_01: Like I observe Matt Cahn.
[0:44:47] SPEAKER_01: Whenever we ask Matt, how are you?
[0:44:49] SPEAKER_01: Like we're friends.
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_01: Hey, how's it going?
[0:44:51] SPEAKER_01: Great.
[0:44:52] SPEAKER_01: Amazing.
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_01: And I think it is going great and amazing.
[0:44:57] SPEAKER_01: But I think like every single human being, if he wanted to, he could complain.
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_01: There's always something to complain about.
[0:45:04] SPEAKER_01: Always.
[0:45:05] SPEAKER_01: So it's like, oh, well, that's really interesting.
[0:45:08] SPEAKER_01: He's a really lovely, genuine, real person to be around.
[0:45:13] SPEAKER_01: So I'll play with that.
[0:45:15] SPEAKER_01: What if every time someone asks me, I knew one guy, I loved him.
[0:45:19] SPEAKER_01: He was a carpenter.
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_01: Every time I said, how are you?
[0:45:22] SPEAKER_01: He said, better every day.
[0:45:24] SPEAKER_01: That's great.
[0:45:25] SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think he had great days every day.
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_01: I know that.
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:45:29] SPEAKER_01: But at this point, it's a certain amount of play.
[0:45:32] SPEAKER_01: But if you're starting to notice that there's fear or shame or tension,
[0:45:38] SPEAKER_01: then perhaps something else.
[0:45:41] SPEAKER_01: And always tenderness is a good place to start.
[0:45:44] SPEAKER_01: You always can I access my heart?
[0:45:48] SPEAKER_01: Can I turn towards me tenderly?
[0:45:50] SPEAKER_01: Because I think that does so much of the.
[0:45:55] SPEAKER_01: Oh, gosh.
[0:45:58] Unknown: It's like it gets the momentum running.
[0:46:03] SPEAKER_01: And then it's so much easier for other momentum to take place.
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: That's genuinely positive, genuinely caring, genuinely curious.
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_01: It's like the grease for the wheel.
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_01: Mm hmm.
[0:46:15] SPEAKER_00: It's like Neil, I'm saying tenderness and transcendence are one in the same.
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_00: That moment was so powerful for me because.
[0:46:22] SPEAKER_00: If we can cultivate tenderness, it is the game changer.
[0:46:26] SPEAKER_00: It is the softening agent and.
[0:46:28] SPEAKER_00: Your mind, your ego structure will very naturally and very happily tell you,
[0:46:34] SPEAKER_00: why can't you be more tender?
[0:46:38] SPEAKER_00: You weren't tender just then with yourself.
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_00: And then we can be tender even to that, even to that voice.
[0:46:45] SPEAKER_00: And it's just like anything.
[0:46:47] SPEAKER_00: It's just a learned skill.
[0:46:48] SPEAKER_00: What is it?
[0:46:49] SPEAKER_00: What does it feel like?
[0:46:50] SPEAKER_00: Genuine tenderness.
[0:46:52] SPEAKER_00: What does it feel like?
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_00: Not am I getting it right or what's the script?
[0:46:58] SPEAKER_00: And as we.
[0:47:01] SPEAKER_00: Just touch into that more and more.
[0:47:04] SPEAKER_00: It does start to become more second nature.
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_00: And like you said, it starts to become the grease for the wheels.
[0:47:09] Unknown: Things start to move down a different track, actually.
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_00: And then it starts to become.
[0:47:15] SPEAKER_00: Playtime, something completely new starts to happen.
[0:47:19] SPEAKER_01: Well, if you're tender and you're loving, you're not in the ego structure,
[0:47:23] SPEAKER_01: like really genuinely tender and loving.
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_01: You're in transcendence.
[0:47:27] SPEAKER_01: So Neelam says transcendence, Matcon says the soul,
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_01: Lock Kelly says awake awareness, right?
[0:47:32] SPEAKER_01: But everybody says the soul has different qualities.
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_01: So if you can just find love, great.
[0:47:40] SPEAKER_01: You're not in the ego structure and then you don't have the dilemma.
[0:47:42] SPEAKER_01: So the other thing I used to sometimes kind of like bristle about,
[0:47:47] SPEAKER_01: not as much as the positivity thing, but kind of like, I don't know.
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_01: I just couldn't accept it fully was it's love or fear.
[0:47:55] SPEAKER_01: You know, when people would like say it's love or fear,
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_01: you're either in love or you're in fear.
[0:47:59] Unknown: And I'd be like, I don't know that feels so.
[0:48:04] SPEAKER_01: To divided or something, because there's plenty of times I didn't feel in love,
[0:48:07] SPEAKER_01: but I didn't conceptualize of myself in fear.
[0:48:11] SPEAKER_01: But I'm starting to understand, you know,
[0:48:13] SPEAKER_01: Matcon would say the same thing.
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_01: He's like, just be done.
[0:48:16] SPEAKER_01: Just choose the light already.
[0:48:17] SPEAKER_01: Like, there's a certain point where he said, I think it's maybe it was in Portland
[0:48:22] SPEAKER_01: this last time in September.
[0:48:23] SPEAKER_01: He's like, you just have to finally choose because you can't straddle both.
[0:48:28] SPEAKER_01: You can't be in your ego and your soul at the same time.
[0:48:31] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mean your ego is not existing.
[0:48:33] SPEAKER_01: You just can't live in both in the same moment.
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm sure I'm putting words on this terribly, but you know what I mean.
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_01: You just can't occupy fear and love in that way at the same exact moment.
[0:48:45] SPEAKER_01: So he's like, just finally choose to be the light.
[0:48:49] SPEAKER_01: Do it.
[0:48:49] SPEAKER_00: Just do it.
[0:48:50] SPEAKER_01: Just choose.
[0:48:51] SPEAKER_01: Do it.
[0:48:52] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:48:52] SPEAKER_01: And he's saying it over a whole weekend in a much sweeter, more well-rounded way.
[0:48:57] SPEAKER_01: But he did at one point say you just have to choose.
[0:48:59] SPEAKER_01: You can choose and you don't have to heal forever.
[0:49:02] SPEAKER_01: This is what's interesting for us to be coming up against is,
[0:49:06] SPEAKER_01: especially for people who've listened to us forever, we talk about healing.
[0:49:10] SPEAKER_01: And then you get the idea, I'm going to have to heal forever.
[0:49:13] SPEAKER_01: But that's not exactly true.
[0:49:16] SPEAKER_01: It's just you have to heal until enough density is gone.
[0:49:18] SPEAKER_01: And then you realize, oh, I don't have to heal forever.
[0:49:20] SPEAKER_01: I don't even know what I was healing.
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_01: I forgot all about it.
[0:49:23] SPEAKER_01: I feel different now.
[0:49:24] SPEAKER_01: And I'm in love.
[0:49:25] SPEAKER_01: And everything feels like you're experiencing it from a different dimension of reality.
[0:49:31] Unknown: So I don't know.
[0:49:33] SPEAKER_01: I'm starting to get like just curious about all those resistances and like, could it be as simple?
[0:49:39] Unknown: And I know it's not simple, but could it be as simple as just choosing
[0:49:47] SPEAKER_01: love and that if there's fear present, there's not love and fear can't be true.
[0:49:53] SPEAKER_01: So now sit and find a place of love and then move again.
[0:49:58] SPEAKER_00: Find whatever is a little waft of tenderness that you can move towards.
[0:50:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know.
[0:50:05] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I don't have the answers, but I think it's really wonderful to introduce this idea
[0:50:12] SPEAKER_00: that there is.
[0:50:14] Unknown: So last thing, I know we're wrapping up, but at my magical Thanksgiving,
[0:50:18] SPEAKER_00: I had a conversation with my dear friend, Emily.
[0:50:20] SPEAKER_00: And sorry, Emily, but I'm totally going to steal this from you.
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: We were talking about how healing doesn't have, she and I have both been on a pretty mega healing
[0:50:27] SPEAKER_00: totally, you know, separate from one another in our own lives for the last six years or so.
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_00: So we were catching up because we only see each other once a year at this.
[0:50:36] SPEAKER_00: And she, I, but we didn't know this is what we were going to, we just connected across through
[0:50:40] SPEAKER_00: them.
[0:50:41] SPEAKER_00: It was like, there's such a thing as done with healing.
[0:50:45] SPEAKER_00: And she was saying, you know, God, I spent all these years feeling like,
[0:50:50] SPEAKER_00: I just need to learn how to navigate being adrift in this rowboat on the ocean.
[0:50:55] SPEAKER_00: And like, I feel pretty seasick all the time, but I can just, I guess I just get good at
[0:51:00] SPEAKER_00: riding the waves.
[0:51:01] SPEAKER_00: The, this is my life now thing.
[0:51:02] SPEAKER_00: This is my life.
[0:51:03] SPEAKER_00: Now I just ride the waves.
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_00: She's like, and then all of a sudden the rowboat washes ashore and you're like, oh,
[0:51:09] Unknown: oh, land, land.
[0:51:12] SPEAKER_00: Like there's a whole other experience here.
[0:51:14] SPEAKER_00: And then you go explore the land, right?
[0:51:18] SPEAKER_00: It's not like you, then you sit in your rowboat and you're like, this feels different.
[0:51:22] SPEAKER_00: Then you get to have a whole different experience of life.
[0:51:24] SPEAKER_00: You get out of the rowboat, you stand on dry land, you explore the dry land, you live your life
[0:51:30] SPEAKER_00: on land.
[0:51:31] SPEAKER_00: It's just a different experience than, I guess I have to learn how to ride these waves forever.
[0:51:38] SPEAKER_00: So there is land and you know, we've been doing the show for a couple of years.
[0:51:43] SPEAKER_00: I'm so glad because I'm somebody who's identified very closely with my healing journey and with
[0:51:51] SPEAKER_00: my suffering.
[0:51:52] SPEAKER_00: God bless me.
[0:51:53] SPEAKER_00: Like that was very much a part of my identity structure.
[0:51:58] SPEAKER_00: I'm so glad we get to bring this to the fore.
[0:52:01] SPEAKER_00: There is actually a totally different experience of reality that's possible and there's nothing
[0:52:06] SPEAKER_00: wrong with you if you're not there yet.
[0:52:09] Unknown: But we do want to say like, it's possible this isn't the forever game of being tossed
[0:52:16] SPEAKER_00: about in the waves.
[0:52:19] SPEAKER_00: There's something else.
[0:52:20] SPEAKER_00: There's land.
[0:52:21] Unknown: I know one of our listeners, I posted something about co-dependence and they were like,
[0:52:28] SPEAKER_01: more work.
[0:52:29] SPEAKER_01: It never stops.
[0:52:30] Unknown: I know I saw that and I was like, oh, it's, you know, it's more opportunities for
[0:52:38] SPEAKER_00: total freedom is more like what we're pointing out.
[0:52:40] SPEAKER_00: We need a group hug.
[0:52:42] SPEAKER_00: Not like here's your new assignment.
[0:52:47] SPEAKER_01: That happens a lot of times if we're overloaded, you know, that's usually like for me,
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_00: this is overloaded time.
[0:52:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:52:55] SPEAKER_01: The symbol, the nervous system is like, no, one more thing.
[0:52:59] SPEAKER_01: I'm at complete overstimulation.
[0:53:01] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, if that's where you are, that'll happen too.
[0:53:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:53:06] SPEAKER_00: And tenderness for that.
