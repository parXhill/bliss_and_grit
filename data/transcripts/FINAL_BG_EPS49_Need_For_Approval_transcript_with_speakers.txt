[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_00: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about being
[0:00:18] SPEAKER_00: on the embodied spiritual path. What does that actually mean? What is a real evolution
[0:00:24] SPEAKER_00: of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the
[0:00:29] SPEAKER_00: joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. Whether you're new to
[0:00:36] SPEAKER_00: the show or you've been listening for a while, just a note about the frame here. We're not
[0:00:41] Unknown: having these conversations as the word. We sure as hell aren't gurus. We're just a couple
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_00: of regular humans having a talk and sharing our personal experiences as we follow our
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_00: own paths. In this episode, we're talking about the sneaky need to be liked. Over the
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: years of our self-exploration, it's become super clear just how much of our own desires
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_00: for approval can drive our choices and cloud out our clarity. Of course, it's pretty human
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_00: to want to be accepted by others, but what happens when you do it at your own expense?
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_00: Or when the desire to be likable takes on a full-fledged good girl or good boy identity?
[0:01:30] SPEAKER_00: Or even worse, when it keeps your past trauma recirculating in a never-ending loop of self-sacrifice
[0:01:38] SPEAKER_00: or self-flagellation? These questions are just the surface of this conversation. As
[0:01:44] SPEAKER_00: approval junkies in rehab, we've got lots to share in this episode on the ever-fascinating
[0:01:49] SPEAKER_00: topic of needing to be liked. If you're enjoying the show, we'd be delighted if you left a review
[0:01:57] SPEAKER_00: on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. Please also head over to blissandgrit.com
[0:02:05] SPEAKER_00: where you can get resources, you can buy goodies, and you can subscribe to hear updates on upcoming
[0:02:12] SPEAKER_00: events or just to get our Friday newsletters that we've been sending out. One last thing before we
[0:02:19] SPEAKER_00: head into the conversation, we do tend to curse. So if you are in mixed non-swearing company,
[0:02:27] Unknown: you may want to wear headphones. Okay, here we go. Hello, Vanessa. Hi, darling. As usual,
[0:02:38] SPEAKER_01: you and I have zero idea what's going to come out of our mouths, except we had a little brief
[0:02:43] Unknown: convo about what's up. So what's up for me, what's most alive right now is just watching
[0:02:53] SPEAKER_01: how much the need for approval, the need to be liked, the need to be likable runs my whole life.
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_01: It's fascinating to watch this layer. And like I remember reading or hearing Byron Katie at one
[0:03:14] SPEAKER_01: point talk about how she only has one prayer. Like when she prays, it's only ever one thing,
[0:03:19] SPEAKER_01: which is something along the lines of, I'm paraphrasing, please God, spare me the need
[0:03:25] Unknown: for approval. Oh, that's a goodie. Yes. And I think it's something like spare me and all beings
[0:03:32] SPEAKER_01: from the need for approval. And I remember when I first read that probably a decade ago,
[0:03:39] Unknown: I remember it striking me as sweet, but also kind of like, besides the point,
[0:03:46] SPEAKER_01: like it was this very small thing to wish for yourself and for humanity to wish that they
[0:03:51] SPEAKER_01: wouldn't want approval. I'm like, well, I mean, the need for approval is annoying.
[0:03:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I thought that, but it's so human. Right? Like shouldn't you wish for something
[0:04:00] SPEAKER_01: more important, like compassion, 100% of the time, peace, you know, whatever. And then I've
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_01: just realized more and more and more as things have fallen away that like my need for approval,
[0:04:15] SPEAKER_01: which I think is woven into all of us, I do think it's just a part of being a human,
[0:04:21] SPEAKER_01: is the thing that creates all of the problem, you know, and as this path goes along, like I
[0:04:28] SPEAKER_01: was just relistening to our talk from last week that airs as we're recording in real time now,
[0:04:34] SPEAKER_01: airs tomorrow. And I'm talking about like getting a craniosacral session, having this download,
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_01: right? The spiritual insight, which happens a lot when you're a meditator, when you're engaged in
[0:04:44] SPEAKER_01: this path, it happens a fair amount. And I remember as I was saying it to you in our last call, like,
[0:04:50] Unknown: don't do it, don't say it. Don't be the weird one. Don't be wacky. And wanting to talk to you about
[0:04:58] SPEAKER_01: it now in this way, like the degree of rawness that this has and just being like, don't, okay,
[0:05:03] SPEAKER_01: but there's always this little movement of like, but polish it up a little, be likable, don't be
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_01: weird. Don't be, it's amazing. Like how much it's like, I'm totally willing, I'm totally willing to
[0:05:17] SPEAKER_01: live a life of integrity and clarity and truth and like really moving from love in the world, except
[0:05:26] Unknown: at the end of all that, I had better be really likable by everyone. Everyone will be like, wow,
[0:05:34] Unknown: she's nice and admirable. And I like her. Like, that's not at all what's going to happen.
[0:05:42] SPEAKER_01: Of course, you know, like that's not what happens.
[0:05:45] SPEAKER_00: Well, dude, stop popping my bubble because
[0:05:47] Unknown: this, you know, that's what I want to happen to. I, I, I don't even know what to say.
[0:05:56] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes my head gets so log jammed as I hear myself say on the podcast, I have too much to say
[0:06:02] SPEAKER_00: this. I have nothing to say. I'm like, and scene. That's it. Right. I just want to be likable episode
[0:06:09] Unknown: complete. And it sucks. Goodbye. I don't want to talk about it. Yeah. Because it's running my life.
[0:06:16] Unknown: I think it was when we had interviewed Kieran, I was talking about how recently I had what I call
[0:06:23] SPEAKER_00: fright week, which is this week where it just felt like fear was oozing out of my pores. And I was
[0:06:30] SPEAKER_00: dreaming these like fear based dreams, which I haven't in so long, really, I do. I did have a
[0:06:36] Unknown: history of nightmares and such like that. But something nowadays that doesn't seem to be the
[0:06:42] SPEAKER_00: norm. But all of a sudden this whole week, it was all bad dreams. The crazy thing is like
[0:06:48] SPEAKER_00: two out of like three or four of the bad dreams were like high school traumas, like stupid.
[0:06:56] SPEAKER_00: People didn't like me. Someone was judging me. I can't remember if I said this in a recording
[0:07:02] SPEAKER_00: or I said it to you last week, but like one of them was I was a model and someone was taking
[0:07:07] SPEAKER_00: pictures of me at the same time as another girl from high school was like not liking me. So it's
[0:07:12] Unknown: all my fears at once, you know, body image fears. And what really was funny is okay, so as I'm going
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_00: through this right week, I could tell what Kieran had said in the episode I had felt, regardless,
[0:07:24] SPEAKER_00: I had felt prior like, oh, it's a good sign. It's like fears on the run, like really feels like a
[0:07:29] Unknown: detox and an emergence in a really good way. And I'm like, this is it. This is the big boogie man
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_00: that lives in me. I know, is that people won't like me. Is that I'm unlikable,
[0:07:42] SPEAKER_00: maybe even unlovable, heaven forbid. Certainly that I'm a bad person, you know, that I'm a
[0:07:48] Unknown: disappointment as a human being. I had one dream where, I mean, one moment where someone was going
[0:07:53] SPEAKER_00: to break into my house. So that was like the one oogie boogie left for, but really the most of it
[0:07:59] SPEAKER_00: was just that, that I'm not likable. And I find over the last few weeks, you know, it stuck around,
[0:08:05] SPEAKER_00: I can observe it. It's, it's coming back to play a little bit and I'm just sort of watching it as
[0:08:11] SPEAKER_00: it evolves. And I see myself thinking things like, you know, but would a good person do that?
[0:08:18] SPEAKER_00: Right. So take the simplest example. Let's say someone texts you and you don't want to respond
[0:08:24] SPEAKER_00: or, you know, you want to respond in a way that you're not sure that they'll like, you know, they
[0:08:30] SPEAKER_00: want like a long conversational response and you just really want to send back a word,
[0:08:35] SPEAKER_00: you know, these kinds of things. I can feel what's natural for me, right? I can feel where I want to
[0:08:42] SPEAKER_00: go. And then I started thinking, but it's like, would only a shitty person do that? You know,
[0:08:47] SPEAKER_00: and, and how do I rectify it? And in this whole exploration, I've seen a few things, one, what
[0:08:53] SPEAKER_00: you're pointing to is my attachment to this good girl identity that's really likable. And
[0:09:00] SPEAKER_00: really virtuous. And then two, the way that my conditioning around spirituality still shows up
[0:09:08] Unknown: as if you're spiritual, you have to be a good person. And then good seems to mean that there's
[0:09:15] SPEAKER_00: certain tenets of life you follow. Some of them are very easy for me, like don't kill someone and
[0:09:22] SPEAKER_00: don't cheat on people. I can do these things. I can figure them out, but others are like,
[0:09:27] Unknown: you know, do I eat meat or don't I, you know, do I have to like everyone? What if people want to
[0:09:33] SPEAKER_00: talk to me, you know, a lot of people want to talk to me about their problems. It's kind of what I do
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_00: for a living. So I have a knack for listening to have to talk to everyone because they have a need,
[0:09:45] Unknown: you know, so starting to look at this good girl identity, this idea that spirituality means you're
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_00: a quote unquote good person. And what does that actually mean? Because since there's not a lot
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_00: since there's not an agreed upon formula, the only way I can tell if I'm a spiritually good person is
[0:10:02] Unknown: if people seem to be happy with me. So very sick right now for me. I reminded of I don't know if
[0:10:12] SPEAKER_01: I feel like this was in an interview, but maybe it was in a teaching. My memory of it is that I'm
[0:10:18] SPEAKER_01: hearing Adyashanti say it. So I feel like I heard him say this in a recording and he was talking
[0:10:23] SPEAKER_01: about Jesus. And of course he has that book that I love, Resurrecting Jesus. So maybe maybe he was
[0:10:28] SPEAKER_01: being interviewed about that book when it was released. And he was saying how Jesus, who I think
[0:10:33] Unknown: we can all argue pretty strongly is like, you know, a spiritually good person. He's, you know,
[0:10:41] SPEAKER_01: somebody for a few thousand years who we've held up as like a figure and ideal of what spirituality
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_01: lived, embodied spirituality looks like in a life. And he was saying that Jesus was one of the first
[0:10:57] SPEAKER_01: people, or at that time anyway, a rare human who did not have the orientation of
[0:11:06] SPEAKER_01: do they like it? Will they like it? They meaning whoever, everyone else in the world. If I say this,
[0:11:13] SPEAKER_01: you know, if I speak out against corruption in the temple, corruption in the hierarchy of my
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_01: faith, will they like it? You know, is there some way that I should just sugar coated or like just
[0:11:27] SPEAKER_01: make friends with the right people and not upset the wrong people and kind of maneuver my way in
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_01: and say it in a way that's kind of appealing and doesn't really ruffle feathers, but can get a
[0:11:39] SPEAKER_01: little bit of change made, but doesn't rock the boat too much. Like this was not this person.
[0:11:45] SPEAKER_01: You know, he didn't give a shit at all about will they like it, you know, and he was crucified for
[0:11:52] Unknown: it, which I think is like a part of the the deep wiring and all of us to be liked. Even if we're
[0:12:03] SPEAKER_01: not talking about being killed, we're just talking about how we have historically as humans relied on
[0:12:09] SPEAKER_01: and the support of our culture, you know, back in the day or even today, if you're still living
[0:12:14] SPEAKER_01: in a tribe in the Amazon, if you are shunned, you are fucked. Like that's the same as death.
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_01: If the community isn't going to help support you, if the community decides we don't like it,
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_01: we don't like you, we're turning our back on you, you're screwed. So this is like, I mean,
[0:12:30] SPEAKER_01: I can laugh at myself and how much at the end like, yes, I want to be living from truth, but also as
[0:12:35] SPEAKER_01: long as everyone likes it. But it is really like primal survival wiring. So even though it's funny
[0:12:43] SPEAKER_01: to see it, it's also makes sense just from a biological wiring perspective of like, wow, it's
[0:12:51] Unknown: really been coded as important in all of us to make sure that we maintain at least a certain level of
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_01: approval, certain level of likability. And of course, when you start
[0:13:06] Unknown: deconditioning yourself, when you start watching the way you act in the world based on
[0:13:15] SPEAKER_01: belief systems that were sort of implanted in you at a very young age from your family and origin,
[0:13:20] SPEAKER_01: and it was implanted in them from the people who came down the line before them, as you let go of
[0:13:26] Unknown: that. And you're not playing your normal role, whether it's in your family of origin or within
[0:13:32] SPEAKER_01: your friend group or at your job or in your partnership. It's often not experienced as
[0:13:40] SPEAKER_01: likable, because people expect you to just do the dance you've always done.
[0:13:47] SPEAKER_01: So it's, it's scary to shift any kind of programming away from doing the dance I've always done.
[0:13:56] Unknown: You know, for me, like I'm wanting to do a lot more writing. So like on my personal
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_01: blog, which isn't a blog, my personal website, which I would like to get the blog going.
[0:14:08] SPEAKER_01: I have all these articles I want to write that just don't have any home. So I'm like,
[0:14:10] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I can just put them on that, my personal website page and all these I'm writing in my
[0:14:16] SPEAKER_01: head all the time. It's a great love of mine. I want to do that. And honestly, one of the major
[0:14:21] SPEAKER_01: reasons why I haven't is like, I just I go to write it. And I'm like, I know what's true. I know
[0:14:25] SPEAKER_01: what I want to write. I know what I want to say it writes itself. And I just am like, I don't
[0:14:31] Unknown: want to, it's like, I'm not ready to come out of the closet, quite. There's a lot of coming out
[0:14:36] SPEAKER_01: of the closet that we do here, I'm very much myself. But there's this way that if I'm slowing
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_01: down enough to write, and articulate, I really feel this. And I for sure know that I have friends
[0:14:54] SPEAKER_01: who love me dearly and who I love dearly. And they'll be like, Wow, Brooks really gone off the
[0:15:00] SPEAKER_01: deep ends, potentially. And I'm just talking I'm not talking like wackadoodle stuff. I'm just
[0:15:04] Unknown: talking basic spiritual concepts like I am not my thoughts, right, which we do talk about here. But
[0:15:14] SPEAKER_01: writing it out in a clear way is like, somehow too threatening to my being.
[0:15:19] Unknown: Well, certainly. And then you're taking a stance. Yeah, and it's written down.
[0:15:24] SPEAKER_00: And it's written and it's it sounds like you're taking a stand for something as opposed to just
[0:15:29] SPEAKER_00: two friends chatting. We're just chatting. It's just our personal experiences, you know, which
[0:15:35] SPEAKER_00: can give us a little cushion. I mean, I've been afraid of coming out of the spiritual closet
[0:15:42] SPEAKER_00: for years, right? Because you're talking about two different things all at once, at least in,
[0:15:46] Unknown: you know, for me, what I'm pulling is two different things. So I have my basic human instinct
[0:15:52] Unknown: to want to be safe, which means be approved of, right, be accepted into the group. And I always
[0:16:00] SPEAKER_00: used to talk about that when people were seeking approval, and then they'd feel bad about it.
[0:16:04] Unknown: You know, like, I shouldn't care what other people think. And I'm like, Well, of course you do,
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_00: right? I mean, we're wired to care about what other people think. And sometimes we don't know
[0:16:14] SPEAKER_00: if we're doing something that's aligned or not until we see the reaction in our ecosystem.
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: We observe how that reaction sits with us, you know, so of course we're looking.
[0:16:25] SPEAKER_00: And I think about psychology and I think about how we develop and we develop through mirroring.
[0:16:30] Unknown: And if you're not mirrored by your world, you don't develop normal psychology. Right, so important.
[0:16:38] SPEAKER_00: It's so foundational. And that is the very fundamental aspect of approval, right? You see me,
[0:16:45] SPEAKER_00: I exist, and then you make space for my very existence. And I know that I exist because I see
[0:16:52] Unknown: myself being reflected in you. And my goodness coming back at me through you. So I get how
[0:17:01] Unknown: fundamental it is for us. And that's why judging our desire to be seen, to be heard, to be loved,
[0:17:10] Unknown: to be validated is so hurtful, actually, and harmful to our process of healing. But you get
[0:17:18] Unknown: to a point, like the point that we're at, where we've had a lot of compassion for that a lot of
[0:17:25] SPEAKER_00: mirroring, a lot of being seen, a lot of being heard, a lot of this. And then it just becomes
[0:17:31] Unknown: so clear that this track is still track, track, like record track, like this track, this voice is
[0:17:38] Unknown: still running the show. The calling shots. There's a piece of me that is still going on and on that
[0:17:45] Unknown: is quite thick in its belief that I must be or I'm not safe. And it's not safe to express
[0:17:54] Unknown: alternative ideas and concerns. And then we have this funny thing. So okay, to come out of the
[0:18:00] Unknown: spiritual closet is something I've been saying a while because the way I kind of dealt with this in
[0:18:06] SPEAKER_00: my life is I'm not going to change who I am. I'm going to believe what I believe and I'm going to
[0:18:12] Unknown: think what I think. But I'm just not going to tell you. Yeah. And then I don't have to have conflict.
[0:18:18] Unknown: But I don't have to surrender myself either, because I grew up in a codependent family.
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_00: So to me, it was either I am myself, but then there's conflict or I have to surrender myself.
[0:18:29] SPEAKER_00: And there was this great thing that I came up with, which was just called hiding, right? Like,
[0:18:34] SPEAKER_00: keep it close to the chest. And I don't care. I always feel like I don't have to talk about myself
[0:18:39] SPEAKER_00: with everybody. If people are genuinely curious, then it's a safe space. And then I would share.
[0:18:46] SPEAKER_00: So I have a lot of beliefs about things that I don't share, especially before bliss and grit.
[0:18:51] SPEAKER_00: And even here, we do share a lot. I think this was a sign of how much our muscles are building
[0:18:56] SPEAKER_00: around feeling safe doing this. But there's like smaller nuances of the more obscure things,
[0:19:02] Unknown: the things that could sound weirder that we'll just keep to ourselves unless someone asks us,
[0:19:07] SPEAKER_00: or unless you say something to provoke me, you know, like something arises.
[0:19:12] Unknown: So then there's this level of like, can I come out of the closet on the spiritual level? And you
[0:19:18] SPEAKER_00: pointed to Jesus and even aria Shanti was talking about that in his talk, like, we're not going to
[0:19:23] Unknown: be crucified today. It's right to yourself, it's safe to to leave what you believe and to talk
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_00: about them, not to try to convert people, not to manipulate others, not to do all that shit, but
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_00: just to express what's true to you, you know, thank God it's safer than that. But this particular fear
[0:19:44] Unknown: of coming out of the closet and being who you are in spiritual topics, just in general, just on
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_00: what you believe that's very precious and very like close to your heart. I mean, I can't tell you
[0:19:56] SPEAKER_00: how many clients I've worked with that deal with the very same thing. It's got to be so encoded.
[0:20:00] Unknown: Yeah. And I think also just because there's a way that I feel like people can talk about this or
[0:20:08] Unknown: can hear the conversation we're having as like, like it's content that I either do or don't want
[0:20:15] Unknown: to hand over. And that's a part of it, for sure. But part of it is also just like, when you change,
[0:20:22] SPEAKER_01: like I've changed a lot in the last two years. And so some of what that looks like is when I'm
[0:20:28] SPEAKER_01: with some of my longer term friends, I start getting this question a lot. Are you okay?
[0:20:34] Unknown: Okay. And they are always asking that question when nothing's happening. So it's when we're in
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_01: the kitchen prepping vegetables, and I just seem quiet to them. Or we're walking in the woods or
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_01: we're going to the ice cream shop. So it's never they're never asking that question when I'm
[0:20:54] SPEAKER_01: nervous, agitated, crying, angry, spewing thoughts, it's always in a quiet moment. And they it there's
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_01: something catches their attention. And they look at me and they're like, Are you okay?
[0:21:06] Unknown: I'm like, Yeah, I'm just and it's like, what do you what is my response? Because it's like, I'm just
[0:21:13] SPEAKER_01: chopping vegetables. But I think what they're noticing is that I didn't ever used to be just
[0:21:18] Unknown: chopping vegetables. Like, I'm a busy person, like busy is one of my drugs of choice and busy,
[0:21:26] SPEAKER_01: not just in physical activities of my life and like, overworking, over exercising, that kind of
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_01: thing. But also just mentally busy, like I'm always hatching some ideas or, or fantasizing,
[0:21:39] SPEAKER_01: right? Like, if I'm chopping vegetables with a girlfriend, typically there'll be some fantasy
[0:21:42] SPEAKER_01: vacation we're planning for four years from now in the DR or whatever, you know, it's like, there's
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_01: always something like I'm one of those people historically, I've always got stuff that like,
[0:21:51] SPEAKER_01: I'm talking about, or this happened, or I'm thinking about this, or this is what's up,
[0:21:56] SPEAKER_01: or these are my business ideas, like, that's been a part of my personality for a long time. And
[0:22:01] Unknown: that's a lot of what's fallen away. And just because I'm not, why would I plan anything in
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_01: a certain way, which doesn't mean that I don't, but it just doesn't have that same quality of like,
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_01: needing to grab at something or make things happen, or that it's tied into my worth or my value,
[0:22:19] SPEAKER_01: like a lot of that's gone away. And so what that looks like in practice, is that I'm just kind of
[0:22:25] SPEAKER_01: quieter. And like when I'm chopping vegetables, I'm chopping vegetables, or a lot of what I'll say
[0:22:30] SPEAKER_01: to my friends and loved ones is like, in reality, a lot of what it means is that I've just gotten
[0:22:35] SPEAKER_01: more boring. And that's just really quite true. I'm just more boring. I'm still funny and interesting
[0:22:42] Unknown: and all those things. And I still have things I enjoy, which are the same things I used to enjoy,
[0:22:47] Unknown: like being out in nature and wherever. But in many ways, I'm just more boring.
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_00: I don't think you're more boring. You might be more boring to people who are looking for something
[0:22:56] Unknown: else out of you, because I just had a delightful weekend with you, or I wasn't bored for a second.
[0:23:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's true. I guess it's more like, what is the layer of relating that we've been at,
[0:23:08] SPEAKER_01: right? Because it's like you and I relate on this layer. But if the layer is like,
[0:23:14] SPEAKER_01: what's Brooke cooking up this time? And then Brooke's not cooking up anything anymore,
[0:23:18] Unknown: then it's like, are you okay? Right. You're not doing the thing. You're not doing the thing
[0:23:23] SPEAKER_00: that you do, right? And then something that they've come to appreciate, or maybe that they were even
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_00: attracted to you for. And then all of a sudden it falls away. So in that relative reality,
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_00: it may feel that way. But in reality, reality, your ever the delight always has been stays the same.
[0:23:44] SPEAKER_00: Thank you. Yes. Take it. You're like,
[0:23:51] SPEAKER_00: some of this has to be, I don't know, try this on for size. I'm thinking some of this has to be
[0:23:57] SPEAKER_00: a worth issue on some level. Oh, my god. Nitty gritty level, right? Because, okay,
[0:24:03] SPEAKER_00: so what am I afraid of? All right, here you and I are practicing.
[0:24:08] SPEAKER_00: Practicing what? What are we practicing doing? We're on these embodied spiritual paths. Okay,
[0:24:16] SPEAKER_00: we're trying to relate to reality on filter to reality and truth. We have a teacher like Karen,
[0:24:24] SPEAKER_00: and Karen is not dogmatic, really at all other than on relating to reality and truth.
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_00: Adi Ashanti seemed quite the same, though I know him a lot less well as a teacher than I do Karen.
[0:24:36] Unknown: So all of a sudden, she's giving us permission to not have to follow a bunch of dogma. Because if
[0:24:43] SPEAKER_00: you're, if you're studying Christianity, you know, or Judeo Christian traditions, you have the 10
[0:24:49] Unknown: commandments, you know, if you study Buddhism, there are precepts for how you're supposed to live.
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_00: If you study yoga, there's rules for how you're supposed to live. I mean, really, in every
[0:24:59] SPEAKER_00: tradition, I'm imagining at least those three big ones that I'm more aware of. There are rules for
[0:25:05] SPEAKER_00: how one lives and one behaves. And that's what makes you a good person. Yeah, right. That's how
[0:25:11] Unknown: you're on the path. So all of a sudden, we start working with these teachers that are actually
[0:25:18] Unknown: scratching a lot of dogma and saying completely scratching it. Yeah, stay right in the moment,
[0:25:25] Unknown: and feel what's right by listening, like feel where the movement is moving, right, and let it unfold
[0:25:32] Unknown: and trust life and trust yourself. And like, we're hearing that. So now, we start to get into what
[0:25:39] Unknown: it really means to trust your life where you're like, Okay, if I don't have a script for how I live,
[0:25:48] Unknown: so let's take this idea. And a friend calls me, and I don't want to call them back. Something very
[0:25:55] Unknown: simple, or someone wants to go out for tea with you and talk about everything that's going on in
[0:26:02] SPEAKER_00: their life, and you don't want to. Now, if I could follow a prescription, I would say,
[0:26:08] SPEAKER_00: well, you always have to be there for your neighbor. So to be a good spiritual person,
[0:26:12] Unknown: I should go. And there's a relief in that prescription. Because, who I get to be a good
[0:26:19] SPEAKER_00: spiritual person, I do the thing. But in reality, what you and I have noticed, which is why we've
[0:26:25] SPEAKER_00: let go of a lot of these precepts is that then I go and I do the thing and I meet with a person,
[0:26:30] SPEAKER_00: and then I feel shitty, and I'm kind of pissed at them, and I'm really exhausted. And then I take
[0:26:34] Unknown: it out of my husband and so that going against the grain because of some idea, or some set of
[0:26:44] Unknown: regulations, it that doesn't work. So we're on to what's the next thing. So the next thing is,
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, how can I feel into what's true for me? How can I live from a place like that,
[0:26:55] Unknown: and then trust that if I do that, it's all okay. But what we have to trust is that somewhere inside
[0:27:01] Unknown: of us, there's this essential, essentially, right being, you know, like that I'm not going to ruin
[0:27:10] SPEAKER_00: the world or fuck things up or destroy people in my path or garner more enemies than I can count
[0:27:16] Unknown: and get crucified, right? Like we have to sort of let go of the reins. Because those regulations,
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_00: while they're beautiful, and it's good they're there, but once you start to get to a certain
[0:27:28] SPEAKER_00: place in your on your path to truth, you start to let them go because you realize that it has to
[0:27:36] SPEAKER_00: come from a lived experience. But to let go of those ego reins that we have on our personality,
[0:27:43] Unknown: and on what's right and wrong, we have to trust that something is going to unfold that has a
[0:27:49] SPEAKER_00: rightness to it, which is, in essence, like we have to trust that we're worthy of trusting.
[0:27:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and that there's basic goodness, right? Because I think when a lot of people think of
[0:28:00] Unknown: the words, you did great. But what I imagine, what I know the mind likes to do is it says,
[0:28:09] SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'm going to let go of my need for approval and my need to be liked.
[0:28:13] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to be a shitty, shitty truth teller.
[0:28:15] SPEAKER_01: And I think what we picture is like some fuckwad like Trump, right? Who's,
[0:28:20] SPEAKER_01: now Trump is actually and I'm not going to waste a lot of my breath on that disgusting
[0:28:25] Unknown: excuse of a human being. But he's an example of somebody who desperately needs approval,
[0:28:31] SPEAKER_01: right? We know this. But it's just that he has codified what is approval worthy, which is tough,
[0:28:41] SPEAKER_01: full of bluster, doesn't take any prisoners, you know, like that kind of thing, right? That equals
[0:28:46] SPEAKER_01: approval. And so he needs to be seen as that identity, that kind of person. So it's not that
[0:28:52] SPEAKER_01: he's letting go of the need for approval. And so he's an asshole, it's that he's an asshole,
[0:28:57] SPEAKER_01: because he needs to be approved of based on these terms that his ego crafted, you know, without his
[0:29:03] Unknown: his conscious awareness of that, obviously, just like all of us. So we have to trust that the need
[0:29:11] SPEAKER_01: for approval isn't the thing that's holding together our ability to show up in the world
[0:29:16] SPEAKER_01: as decent human beings. And I find that the most fascinating part of this whole thing is that what
[0:29:22] SPEAKER_01: we uncover is there's some, in innocence, erroneous belief that underneath the conditioning, this is,
[0:29:33] Unknown: I had better be liked and approved of, is just an asshole. But that's not the case at all. Like,
[0:29:41] SPEAKER_01: it's so funny that we think that that's when we let go of the reins, what we're going to discover
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: is that we are now with an acid tongue, you know, pointing out all of our friends flaws, or that,
[0:29:55] SPEAKER_01: you know, if somebody invites us to a party, and we don't want to go, we're like, I don't need to
[0:29:58] SPEAKER_01: fucking party, you know, like, that's not the case at all. It's this very, very soft
[0:30:05] Unknown: movement, because it's, there's this basic goodness, and basic goodness is, is basic
[0:30:13] SPEAKER_01: love, like, there's love for everyone, including yourself, there's just not this need to
[0:30:19] SPEAKER_01: put on a show of the likable person. That doesn't mean the exact opposite extreme
[0:30:27] SPEAKER_00: of putting people on your crosshairs. It's the same thing people worry about, like, if they stop
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_00: criticizing themselves, and they're going to be lazy and never get another thing accomplished.
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_01: Right. The mind's always telling us, well, if it's not that thing, it's going to be the exact
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: opposite extreme, and it's going to get ugly. And it's like, no, actually, what we discover is the
[0:30:45] SPEAKER_00: whole big, wide, giant middle space. What's funny is, okay, so I'm at the point where I can trust
[0:30:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to be an asshole if I'm just myself, you know, because I've evolved to see myself
[0:30:59] SPEAKER_00: through many different occasions now, and I can, I can see that. And yet, letting go of the idea that
[0:31:06] SPEAKER_00: other people are unhappy with me is a problem. Yeah, that's the hardest one for me. Yeah, it's
[0:31:12] SPEAKER_00: so hard, because so much of my safety and wiring was just keep everybody as happy around you as
[0:31:20] SPEAKER_00: possible. And like, there was too much suffering in the world too much suffering in my family,
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_00: like, you can see what's going on, you know, what they need to make them happy, like, just
[0:31:30] Unknown: why wouldn't you do that? Be generous, be compassionate, you know, do that. So it's like,
[0:31:36] SPEAKER_00: now I recognize, okay, if I don't want to go out with someone for tea, I get I'm not an asshole or
[0:31:42] SPEAKER_00: a bad person, you know, I get to be human and have my needs and preferences. But that moment
[0:31:49] Unknown: where I have to confront that someone may be disappointed, or have their feelings hurt,
[0:31:56] Unknown: or not be happy, you know, or think I'm a bad friend, or in the case of my family, like,
[0:32:04] SPEAKER_00: you know, if I don't go home for a holiday with my family, then I am to them because of the way that
[0:32:12] SPEAKER_00: their psychological defense mechanisms work for a moment, if not a day or more, a bad daughter.
[0:32:20] Unknown: Yeah. Right.
[0:32:22] Unknown: Selfish. My parents loved to use that word with me, selfish. And you know, it's taken a lifetime,
[0:32:29] SPEAKER_00: especially when those types of words come at you from your primary caregivers to discern, well,
[0:32:35] SPEAKER_00: how would I know if I was selfish? If I was selfish, I wouldn't see if I was selfish,
[0:32:39] SPEAKER_00: because I'd be too selfish to see I'm selfish. So then the information I'm looking for to discern
[0:32:45] Unknown: if I'm selfish is I'm looking in my environment, right? Do other people think I'm selfish? Right,
[0:32:51] SPEAKER_00: because I wouldn't see this major character flaw. But what you don't realize is you'd never be
[0:32:56] Unknown: thinking about it if you were selfish. More for me, I do what I want, I get what I want.
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_00: You're big crying babies, why are you complaining? You just wouldn't have the same thought process
[0:33:09] Unknown: at all. But it creates this kind of feedback loop. When you've had that level of experience or trauma
[0:33:19] Unknown: with people early in your life, where you really were punished, or judged, or yelled at or name
[0:33:28] Unknown: called or hit or whatever, because you didn't make them happy. And I think a lot of us have
[0:33:35] SPEAKER_01: dealt with that. Yeah, and I think that I shouldn't say this, because I actually don't know,
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_01: like I only get to be a female this go round. But I think that women are definitely
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_01: strongly conditioned to the good girl identity, right? Like men get it from a different way in
[0:33:53] SPEAKER_01: our culture, where it's like they're, from what I can glimpse, they're not allowed to be human,
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_01: either. Right? Like they're, they have to play, it's just they have to play a different role,
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_01: where they're not allowed to exist. And for women, they're not allowed to exist looks a lot like
[0:34:12] SPEAKER_01: be likable, be polite, don't ever disappoint anyone. I remember, did you you watched unbreakable
[0:34:17] SPEAKER_01: Kimmy Schmidt, right? Comedy show for those of you listening, Vanessa, and I love the dark comedies.
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_01: But it was in the beginning when they were on the Today show. In the show, they were
[0:34:26] SPEAKER_01: mole women, they were kept in a bunker by a sadist. So ha ha ha good comedy show.
[0:34:32] SPEAKER_01: And one of them was talking about how she got kidnapped. Keep in mind, this is a comedy show.
[0:34:36] SPEAKER_01: And she's like, Well, he said he had a bunch of baby bunny rabbits in his car that I should come
[0:34:41] SPEAKER_01: and see. And I didn't want to be rude. So and then Matt Lauer, who's interviewing them, he was like,
[0:34:47] SPEAKER_01: I'm always amazed by what women are willing to do in order to not appear beat to be rude.
[0:34:51] SPEAKER_01: And I just fell over laughing because it's like we're so conditioned, God forbid anything,
[0:34:57] SPEAKER_01: anything but being perceived of as rude. And that is like so beaten into us in such a and I think
[0:35:05] Unknown: men get that conditioning for sure. But I think they get more of a weak, you know, never be perceived
[0:35:11] Unknown: as as weak. God forbid. And for us, it's rude. And I've long thought that like women would benefit
[0:35:19] SPEAKER_01: from just letting themselves be I know, for me in my life, it's been really beneficial to let myself
[0:35:24] Unknown: be disliked by all the right people. Women friends were nicer about these things. But I think because
[0:35:34] SPEAKER_00: it's been so uncultured, and because some of us have gone through so many things, you know,
[0:35:39] SPEAKER_00: you'll get smacked down sometimes in your life. If you have women friends who think you're being
[0:35:44] SPEAKER_00: rude, or they'll talk about you, or they'll gossip about you. I mean, yeah, women's self police in
[0:35:48] SPEAKER_00: the ugliest ways. The crowd can be thick on that, you know, and there's so many of us trying to
[0:35:54] Unknown: break free of it. But certainly, it's like my biggest forms of trauma came from my family,
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_00: because we were very enmeshed. And like I said, I mean, if I had a normal feeling, I was pretty
[0:36:07] Unknown: selfish or wasn't allowed to be that angry with them. So that makes perfect sense. And then high
[0:36:14] SPEAKER_00: school, you know, and then being in groups of women, only that same trauma got repeated in grad
[0:36:19] Unknown: school twice. Yeah, right. So it wasn't just that we were adolescents. And there was something
[0:36:28] SPEAKER_00: so difficult about having a group of people turn on you. And it's not a totally unfamiliar story,
[0:36:36] SPEAKER_00: because a lot of friends, if I share this, will have had a sort of similar experience,
[0:36:42] Unknown: everyone's might be a little different, where there was some number of people who've turned on
[0:36:48] SPEAKER_00: you. And I think about these levels of group attack, if anyone's been exposed to group attack,
[0:36:54] SPEAKER_00: and group attack is super painful and super scary. And when you talk about coming out of the closet,
[0:37:02] SPEAKER_00: you know, and espousing your views, and even us being on the show, you know, sometimes we do get
[0:37:08] Unknown: people who have criticism that can be hurdy for us. It's one thing when it's like you imagine one
[0:37:15] Unknown: friend won't like it. But to imagine like a group of people could seize this cause against you,
[0:37:22] Unknown: I don't know, group attack, I think is a really potent trauma that many of us have been through.
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_00: And I think, you know, it's all well and good to say to ourselves, like, it's okay, if people don't
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_00: like us, and you have to just be honest and follow what's true for you, because that's where life is,
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_00: and the other is death. And that's great. But we always have to deal with the aftermath when someone
[0:37:48] SPEAKER_01: is legitimately not happy with us. Yeah. And they're going to just legitimately feel that way. And
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_01: we're going to feel their disappointment and their hurt, you know, it's not the most comfortable.
[0:38:00] Unknown: And maybe their anger, you know, if you look, oh, God, the times I didn't go home for Christmas,
[0:38:07] Unknown: I mean, what my parents put me through over like, the level of anger that they had. And so the level
[0:38:13] Unknown: of conflict I had to navigate. And as someone who's conflict avoidant, and can't say on the
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_00: sound of raised voices, because it pierces through my skin so much, you almost just want to do
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_00: anything to avoid that moment. Yeah. And it takes a lot of revelation on what the other
[0:38:33] Unknown: choice is costing you. So in other words, you know, at first, what's really, really clear to us is if
[0:38:40] SPEAKER_00: someone doesn't like me, or if this person is disappointed, or if I hurt these people's feelings,
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_00: we can see very clearly what the fallout is, I'll get a troll on my Facebook page, I'll get a scathing
[0:38:51] SPEAKER_00: email, my parents will yell at me, my boyfriend will be mad, you know, we know what that is.
[0:38:57] SPEAKER_00: And many of us will be conflict avoidant, not all some people will charge into it, because they've
[0:39:04] Unknown: learned to rebel against that experience. But so then for me to short circuit this whole cycle,
[0:39:12] Unknown: I had to recognize how much the other mode of navigating was costing me that when I try to have
[0:39:19] SPEAKER_00: everybody like me, I'm exhausted. When I try to have everybody like me, somehow I always fuck up
[0:39:24] SPEAKER_00: and do something worse because I'm tired and I'm overwhelmed. And now I'm projecting on people that
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_00: they need something from me that they may or may not even need. And I'm already like, distancing
[0:39:36] Unknown: myself. And, you know, it gets more and more mucky. And it's not life. Right. And it is conditioning.
[0:39:45] Unknown: And now because I'm just, I want to see truth, I have to look at it more than anything, because
[0:39:52] Unknown: it's like truth is glaring it right in my face. So there's no other way around it. But I think,
[0:39:58] Unknown: you know, we can't underestimate how gnarled this little knot can be of the need to not upset or
[0:40:08] SPEAKER_00: hurt or freak anyone out or be seen as weird or disappoint or anger anyone around us.
[0:40:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And it costs us, as you pointed out, you know, like our fatigue and I mean, we're harming
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_01: ourselves by going along with something that we know isn't what we want to do. And it costs
[0:40:29] SPEAKER_01: the others to, you know, like in your example of not wanting to go to tea with a friend,
[0:40:34] SPEAKER_01: but then you go and then you spend that time feeling resentful. We do a lot of pretending
[0:40:40] SPEAKER_01: culturally that we don't know what's going on with other people, but we all do know. And then we all
[0:40:45] SPEAKER_01: just have different levels of numbing to that. But most people are pretty aware, like if they're
[0:40:51] Unknown: sitting across someone drinking tea and that person is like exhausted by them, they might not pick up
[0:40:59] SPEAKER_01: on it in the cues of the conversation. If that person is like particularly adept at seeming
[0:41:04] SPEAKER_01: interested in the conversation, but they'll leave and something will just feel off. Like these things
[0:41:09] SPEAKER_01: do leave their imprints, you know, it's actually speaking of like group attack. There's, I live in
[0:41:16] SPEAKER_01: a neighborhood with a group of people who all grew up together, went to college together,
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_01: were in the same fraternities and sororities, married each other, moved back here and are raising
[0:41:26] SPEAKER_01: their kids together. So it's like to say that it's clickish is an understatement. And they're lovely
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_01: human beings who I have nothing in common with, you know, they're hard partiers and I'm the exact
[0:41:35] Unknown: opposite of hard partier. And so, and their kids are the same age as my son, but I don't hang out
[0:41:42] SPEAKER_01: with them. We have nothing in common. You know, for me to hang out with them would be the height
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_01: of pretending to me and the height of pretending to them. And it's like, I just ran into one of
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_01: the moms at Target doing back to school shopping and we're doing the thing, right? Where we're like,
[0:41:55] SPEAKER_01: hi, oh my God, how was your summer? I haven't seen you at the beach. I know we've been so busy.
[0:42:03] SPEAKER_01: And it's so funny because it's like, I couldn't do the height of pretending I've normally done.
[0:42:06] Unknown: And I'm like, she is aware that I just feel and know that I have nothing in common with this group
[0:42:14] SPEAKER_01: and I feel self-conscious because I avoid the hell out of them. And I am aware that she's seeing me
[0:42:21] SPEAKER_01: and she's like, oh, that she's too good for us, Brooke, that sober person who lives down the street
[0:42:29] Unknown: and is judgy and doesn't hang out with us. And it's like, we're having this dialogue under the
[0:42:36] SPEAKER_01: dialogue and we both know we're having it, but we're both doing the pretend on top. But it leaves
[0:42:42] SPEAKER_01: these traces, you know, and it's not easy to be honest all the time. It's not even necessarily
[0:42:46] SPEAKER_01: advisable. Like, what am I going to do? Charge in and be like, I know you're judging me right now.
[0:42:50] Unknown: No, that's not what I'm trying to indicate. But what I could do is look for like, what's
[0:42:56] SPEAKER_01: actually true here? And like, what's actually true in that scenario is I do have affection for this
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_01: woman. I do. Like, I do find her charming. I think she's quite sweet, this particular woman.
[0:43:09] SPEAKER_01: We just don't have anything in common. So it's like, I can connect to her and talk to her instead
[0:43:13] SPEAKER_01: of the like, oh, make excuses thing. I can't, I know I meant to see you guys at the beach,
[0:43:19] SPEAKER_01: but we just didn't get there. But I could, I can relate to her in a genuine way from what's genuine,
[0:43:25] SPEAKER_01: from what's genuine, which is like, I actually find her to be quite lovely, even though we
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_01: don't have anything in common, and we don't hang out. So you do have to sort of look sometimes for
[0:43:35] SPEAKER_01: what's true, because these things leave traces in all of us. They don't feel good. They don't feel
[0:43:42] Unknown: good to the to the us and they don't feel good to the them. So there are benefits.
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_00: You know what I realized? So you know, generally speaking, I agree with this, and I've said it
[0:43:53] SPEAKER_00: before. But in this particular topic matter, perhaps revealing my issues run real deep with
[0:43:59] SPEAKER_00: this topic matter. One of the things I've noticed is that sometimes people don't seem to care.
[0:44:05] SPEAKER_00: Like, you know, you have that person that you're around, and maybe they're draining you,
[0:44:09] SPEAKER_00: and they're kind of putting you in the role of therapist or something. And then, like you,
[0:44:16] SPEAKER_00: I mean, all visible signs would say you're not enjoying that. And yet they want it again.
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_00: And they want it again. And I think it might be linking back to what Kieran had said a couple of
[0:44:28] SPEAKER_00: weeks ago that maybe in in concept, it feels good to them. Yes. So they're clinging to that.
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_00: I'm having a great conversation with Vanessa. That's what's happening right now.
[0:44:38] SPEAKER_00: Right. And I always I wanted to be listened to all day. No one else has listened to me. So in
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_00: concept, it feels good. And perhaps if they were really to slow down and be present, they would say,
[0:44:48] SPEAKER_00: this doesn't feel so good. She looks like she's getting sick. I mean, I had one friend that I
[0:44:52] Unknown: used to put I noticed as I spent time with them, like, my my hands would go under my chin, like,
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_00: if my head was getting heavy. And then over time, I swear, there have been moments where like,
[0:45:05] Unknown: my head was like, and they're just still hard charging through the conversation.
[0:45:12] Unknown: Just chatting and chatting, you know. And so perhaps if they were to really slow down,
[0:45:19] Unknown: they would feel into that. But, you know, certainly my parents have never once stopped and been like,
[0:45:25] SPEAKER_00: nope, Vanessa doesn't really want to be here this Sunday at my pool club. So it doesn't feel nice to
[0:45:31] SPEAKER_00: me. They're like, this is going to feel nice, because family has to be together on a Sunday.
[0:45:36] SPEAKER_00: And they're like clinging to that concept is so intense. Yeah, it feeds their concept.
[0:45:42] SPEAKER_00: And they like their concept. And they're attached to their concept. Now, this is not to say you
[0:45:48] Unknown: can't get free of this, because my relationship with my parents is far superior to anything that
[0:45:55] Unknown: has ever been in my life. Like we have so much more loving kindness and respect for each other
[0:46:03] SPEAKER_00: and compassion. And my parents make so much more space for me to exist than they ever have. And yet,
[0:46:11] SPEAKER_00: they still cling to this concept. And one of the things that has helped a little for me,
[0:46:17] Unknown: I had mentioned this a bit back. I was having a session with Kieran. And we were talking about
[0:46:24] Unknown: something, some relationship in my life. And she was saying, you know, you're letting their pain
[0:46:30] SPEAKER_00: bodies call the shots. And so when someone else is insane, you have to be the one to act from sanity.
[0:46:37] SPEAKER_00: Don't let insanity call the shots. And that just sort of clicked with me, you know, a lot of times,
[0:46:44] SPEAKER_00: if someone's clinging to their concept, not reality, reality. So reality, reality is Brooke
[0:46:49] SPEAKER_00: and I are sitting, Brooke, and I can talk for hours upon hours about our life issues and all
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_00: of our problems. And I do not put my head down on the table. That's reality, reality, right? I'm
[0:46:59] Unknown: engaged. And it's wonderful. But if we're acting from concepts, where some things actually not
[0:47:05] SPEAKER_00: working for us for some reason, whatever it is, maybe it triggers your pain body, maybe
[0:47:12] SPEAKER_00: their chemistry is not right for your chemistry, whatever the case may be.
[0:47:18] SPEAKER_00: If someone's acting from reality, reality, I forgot what I was gonna say.
[0:47:23] Unknown: Hold on. Brain farts at the end. It all happens.
[0:47:26] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God. And this was going to be the pull it together point that was going to make it all
[0:47:30] Unknown: good. It was gonna make it super amazing. That's what I'm trying to talk about. If in
[0:47:38] SPEAKER_00: reality, it doesn't feel good and you're doing it anyway, then you're letting pain bodies call the
[0:47:44] Unknown: shots. Right. And then life gets more clusterfucky. And by nature of letting pain bodies call the
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_01: shots for politeness, for approval. Right, exactly. You have not changed their lives because that pain
[0:47:58] SPEAKER_00: body is just getting fed and it stays very active. It has no chance to be explored. Your pain
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_00: body that says you have to act in accord to make someone happy and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[0:48:10] SPEAKER_00: is active and being fed. And so everyone's just spinning out some insane circle
[0:48:16] SPEAKER_00: living from their pain bodies. And so net, net, I haven't done anything good.
[0:48:22] SPEAKER_00: Right. Exactly. So net, net, my desire is to make a positive difference in this world.
[0:48:28] SPEAKER_00: Okay. Well, I can go to that meeting where I'm going to have my head on the table because I'm so
[0:48:33] SPEAKER_00: exhausted for some reason for listening to this person. But then when I go home and I try to work
[0:48:38] SPEAKER_00: on Bliss and Grid or I work with my clients, I'm tired and I can't show up for my husband. Right.
[0:48:43] Unknown: So net, net, did I do something good? Or if I actually follow my alignment, say, you know what,
[0:48:50] Unknown: I really need is to stay home. Maybe, I don't know, take a bath, do a little meditation, do a little
[0:48:55] SPEAKER_00: stretching, whatever the case may be, but not do this. And then I show up for my clients really
[0:49:00] SPEAKER_00: well and then they show up for people in their lives really well. And then I have a really good
[0:49:04] SPEAKER_00: episode and my brain works and I don't forget what I'm saying in the middle of it. And all these
[0:49:08] Unknown: things happen. Then net, net, there's a more positive outcome. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
[0:49:17] SPEAKER_00: Geez, that took me like 10 minutes to get to that point. No, it was so good because I was going to
[0:49:20] SPEAKER_01: say something at the end too, this whole thing. And now for some reason we're getting the clear
[0:49:24] Unknown: message of like call it a day, ladies. Thanks for listening to today's show. The show notes,
