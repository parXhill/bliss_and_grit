[0:00:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas.
[0:00:40] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're talking about being on the embodied spiritual path.
[0:00:44] SPEAKER_00: What does that actually mean?
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_00: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:53] SPEAKER_00: All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human
[0:00:59] Unknown: life.
[0:01:01] SPEAKER_00: This week, we're going deeper on a conversation we had a few months back, an awakening and
[0:01:06] SPEAKER_00: the nervous system.
[0:01:08] SPEAKER_00: Through numerous personal experiences, recent interviews we've done, and a course we've
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_00: been taking with a teacher named Neelam on the awakening nervous system, we've been getting
[0:01:19] SPEAKER_00: an even more profound understanding of the role the nervous system may play in recognizing
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_00: our true nature.
[0:01:27] SPEAKER_00: From discussing what it means to actually be present, to the basics of polyvagal theory
[0:01:33] SPEAKER_00: and tools that we can use to create shifts, in this episode we're exploring the fascinating
[0:01:39] SPEAKER_00: world of the human nervous system.
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_00: If you've been enjoying the show, you know we are always delighted if you take time to

[0:02:08] SPEAKER_00: One last thing before we head into the conversation, sometimes Brooke and I do curse, so just in
[0:02:14] Unknown: case you're in mixed non-swearing company, you may want to wear some headphones.
[0:02:19] Unknown: Okay everyone, here we go.
[0:02:25] Unknown: Hello Vanessa.
[0:02:26] Unknown: Hello honey.
[0:02:29] Unknown: So we have lately both been listening to, reading, or talking with a variety of teachers
[0:02:37] Unknown: and there's a common theme emerging among all of them and for us.
[0:02:42] SPEAKER_01: And of course all teachers are pointing to the same thing, so it's not like shocking
[0:02:46] Unknown: that there's a common theme, but it's just of course like that whatever is resonant or
[0:02:53] SPEAKER_01: most noticeable for us at any given time and that it's going on for both of us of course
[0:02:57] SPEAKER_01: makes for good convo here on the podcast.
[0:03:00] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[0:03:01] SPEAKER_01: So we had a lovely conversation with Lock Kelly for our last episode and we have Matt
[0:03:08] SPEAKER_01: Kahn coming up and you had a retreat with him recently and we both did, you did the
[0:03:14] SPEAKER_01: whole course and I did one of the classes with Neelam on awakening and the nervous system.
[0:03:21] Unknown: So the theme that's coming up is basically for me that there is this, I'm noticing how
[0:03:30] SPEAKER_01: much teachers are pointing to this really basic, if we can take it out of spiritual
[0:03:34] Unknown: woo-woo land, which we always want to do, we can talk about this process of awakening
[0:03:42] SPEAKER_01: or maturation of consciousness as a physiological thing and that the physiology of that is all
[0:03:50] Unknown: about the capacity of the nervous system, which we've talked about before, but it's
[0:03:59] SPEAKER_01: really fascinating when you have life experience that gives you a really guided tour of the
[0:04:06] Unknown: nervous system.
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_01: So for me, going through some stuff lately where I've been feeling really triggered,
[0:04:12] SPEAKER_01: which we'll talk about more later in the episode, so seeing just how much these ideas about
[0:04:18] SPEAKER_01: dimensions of reality are really different dimensions of capacity within my nervous system
[0:04:26] SPEAKER_01: or where my nervous system is locating.
[0:04:29] SPEAKER_01: So we can talk about autonomic nervous system, we can talk about vagal nerve function and
[0:04:36] SPEAKER_01: just like how do we have adaptable resilient nervous systems and what happens when we inevitably
[0:04:43] Unknown: triggered by something and get put into a less mature part of the brain that's really
[0:04:50] Unknown: much more oriented just towards the survival of the organism at all costs.
[0:05:00] SPEAKER_01: So I just would love to pull that thread out from both of our lives right now and also
[0:05:06] Unknown: from some of the teachers that are really paying attention to because what if, like
[0:05:10] SPEAKER_01: as we get into new paradigm of spirituality, what if one of the things we can do is just
[0:05:15] SPEAKER_01: say forget all of the stuff, what you wear and what words you use and what vows you take
[0:05:22] SPEAKER_01: and all those things are beautiful and wonderful in their own way, but if we just want to really
[0:05:26] Unknown: make it simple or if we just want to help our Western brains do something Western brains
[0:05:31] SPEAKER_01: can do say, let's really look at the adaptability, the flexibility, the range of any given person's
[0:05:44] SPEAKER_01: nervous system and that will tell you a lot about where they're able to locate in terms
[0:05:48] SPEAKER_01: of their consciousness and because of that where they're able to live from in terms of
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_01: their consciousness.
[0:05:54] Unknown: And when I say that what I mean is the difference between suffering and feeling like you're
[0:05:58] Unknown: in hell and having access to a much broader view where you have the ability to not force
[0:06:08] SPEAKER_01: upon yourself states that you've heard are good, but to actually live from compassion,
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_01: to actually live from open heartedness or peace or joy.
[0:06:21] SPEAKER_01: I think it's all about what does our nervous system do naturally and how do we get it to
[0:06:27] Unknown: be more adaptable.
[0:06:32] SPEAKER_00: That was very well said Brooke.
[0:06:33] SPEAKER_01: Really?
[0:06:34] Unknown: Because I felt like I was doing all my things for me and for them and those guys and sometimes.
[0:06:44] Unknown: Well I liked it a lot.
[0:06:46] SPEAKER_01: Photo confidence, I appreciate it.
[0:06:49] SPEAKER_00: It got me thinking too.
[0:06:50] SPEAKER_00: I remember before we were going to interview a Moda Ma and I was preparing all of my questions
[0:06:57] SPEAKER_00: and listening to her on Buddha at the gas pump and reading her book and everything.
[0:07:01] SPEAKER_00: I remember I had pulled out a quote from her interview on Buddha at the gas pump where
[0:07:07] Unknown: she mentioned something to the effect of that awakening really has to do with the nervous
[0:07:13] SPEAKER_00: system at rest.
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_00: But that most of us have so many reactivities built up in the system.
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_00: I always get the image of like kind of like gunk on a mechanism.
[0:07:25] SPEAKER_00: You know like just memories, traumas.
[0:07:28] SPEAKER_00: Some teachers would say from many lives, some teachers may just point to this one and find
[0:07:33] Unknown: that most useful but that there's all this kind of gunk on the mechanism of our nervous
[0:07:39] SPEAKER_00: system, our energy body, our subtle body and that creates reactivities and so we can't
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_00: have access to a nervous system at rest.
[0:07:50] SPEAKER_00: And I wanted to ask her that and we just didn't have the opportunity so it's still
[0:07:55] SPEAKER_00: on my list for her.
[0:07:56] SPEAKER_00: But then shortly after, I started preparing for Locke's interview and I found Neelam's
[0:08:02] Unknown: course and so looks like we're here anyway.
[0:08:06] SPEAKER_00: Right, looks like this is what we're interested in.
[0:08:09] SPEAKER_00: That's what we're interested in.
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_00: I just want to say before I forget because my brain is definitely foggy today that it
[0:08:16] SPEAKER_00: is a complex topic.
[0:08:18] SPEAKER_00: It's super complex, right?
[0:08:19] SPEAKER_00: Like you know even I've taken Neelam's course and I'm actually still in the middle of it
[0:08:24] SPEAKER_00: because I couldn't attend and I'm listening to the recordings.
[0:08:27] SPEAKER_00: There's I think nine hours in total and Neelam basically said, I'm just going to be scratching
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_00: the surface of this topic.
[0:08:33] SPEAKER_00: Just scratching the surface.
[0:08:35] SPEAKER_00: Like nine hours on the nervous system and you're just scratching the surface, right?
[0:08:40] SPEAKER_00: I mean yogic philosophers and practitioners and tantric Buddhist practitioners, I mean
[0:08:47] SPEAKER_00: they've been talking about the physiology of awakening for a long, long time and there's
[0:08:51] SPEAKER_00: probably a lot that can be said.
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_00: Well, let's just talk about you know what we're reading about and what we've been experiencing
[0:08:58] SPEAKER_00: obviously but just for all of you out there.
[0:09:02] SPEAKER_00: Didn't you love, I know you did, I'm just going to speak for you.
[0:09:05] SPEAKER_00: I know that you loved what I loved about Locke which is when he said that he was of the human
[0:09:14] SPEAKER_00: being lineage and that we all have the capacity to awaken the way everybody sort of points
[0:09:23] SPEAKER_00: to but he didn't make it some out there obscure act of grace.
[0:09:29] Unknown: It was really much more about how to shift so that you can bring attention to the aspect
[0:09:39] SPEAKER_00: of awareness that is already awake, right?
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_00: That was really cool and it got me thinking a few things like one, that the human being
[0:09:50] SPEAKER_00: lineage where he believes that awakeness is sort of a developmental stage of a human,
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_00: like it's just part of the natural human development, therefore must point to our physiology.
[0:10:01] SPEAKER_00: I mean every other major transition we've ever had as a human involved some shift in
[0:10:07] Unknown: our physiology, hormonal shifts, probably shifts in our neurotransmitters, shifts in
[0:10:13] Unknown: like I'm sure our neurobiological structures so that's part of it and that B, this ability
[0:10:22] SPEAKER_00: to shift into what is already awake within you, what is already awakeness, that's interesting
[0:10:31] SPEAKER_00: because it starts to get me thinking about the nervous system shifting from sympathetic
[0:10:37] SPEAKER_00: to parasympathetic.
[0:10:39] Unknown: Actually, yeah, that's it, period.
[0:10:43] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to just end that sentence.
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_00: That's what it gets me thinking of and I have been experiencing, I mean if you've all been
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_00: listening you may have heard our first episode on awakening in the nervous system.
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_00: It's been such a close interest of mine because I've been observing how when I am able to
[0:11:01] SPEAKER_00: be very relaxed and open in my parasympathetic state, I have a whole different consciousness
[0:11:08] SPEAKER_00: of the world, like a whole different experience of myself and others and when I'm cranked
[0:11:15] Unknown: into the sympathetic state of fight or flight, different dimension of reality, completely,
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_00: completely.
[0:11:22] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes as if they're inaccessible, if I'm lucky what happens is I have an observing
[0:11:26] Unknown: self while I'm in sympathetic crank.
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_00: So I can be like, oh, something's up, you're not in your best state, this isn't quite,
[0:11:36] SPEAKER_00: you're not seeing things quite clearly, I can have some observing self.
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_00: So I want to hear about both of our stories but maybe we can just kick it off even deeper
[0:11:47] SPEAKER_00: by bringing up something Neelam kept saying in the course, which is that awakening is
[0:11:53] Unknown: very dependent upon the nervous system's ability to be present and that if your nervous system
[0:12:05] Unknown: does not have the capacity to be present, you will continually be projecting the past
[0:12:13] SPEAKER_00: onto the present, your brain and your fight or flight freeze nervous system will be triggered
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_00: as if it is still in the past and you won't have the clarity of discernment to be able
[0:12:26] SPEAKER_00: to identify, oh, this is of the past and this is happening now.
[0:12:31] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:12:32] SPEAKER_01: And just to bring in a little something else that I don't because I never remember anything
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_01: after we've recorded it, I don't think we got into this with Locke but it was my favorite
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_01: question that we had written down in advance, that's just how it goes.
[0:12:44] SPEAKER_01: But he pointed out as a spiritual teacher who's also a clinical psychologist that the
[0:12:51] SPEAKER_01: present is not the now.
[0:12:53] Unknown: So that comes from Locke Kelly and he said because often what you'll see with people
[0:12:58] Unknown: who are depressive is that they feel trapped in the present.
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: And I'm the depressive type and so that really resonated for me because some people may remember
[0:13:13] SPEAKER_01: I've said it on other shows, a cue for me that I'm believing something that's not true
[0:13:18] SPEAKER_01: is when I hear my mind say the lead in sentence, this is just my life now.
[0:13:24] SPEAKER_01: There's just this way that I saran wrap the present moment and go this forever and ever,
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_01: forever and ever, nothing's ever going to get better, which is totally the depressive
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_01: pattern.
[0:13:35] SPEAKER_00: Actually, I just want to note to you when you've been enthusiastic, you do the same
[0:13:39] SPEAKER_00: thing.
[0:13:40] SPEAKER_01: That's true.
[0:13:41] SPEAKER_00: I do.
[0:13:42] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes it's like a projection of great bliss.
[0:13:45] SPEAKER_00: That's true.
[0:13:46] SPEAKER_01: Just so that you know you're not just depressive.
[0:13:50] SPEAKER_01: I grab onto something and I say this forever and ever.
[0:13:53] Unknown: I make it into a time capsule.
[0:13:57] SPEAKER_01: But I think it's a helpful differentiation because if we're talking about the nervous
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_01: system's ability to be here, here doesn't actually mean the present tense.
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_01: The present tense is still a large container that can be like I'm 43, I live at this address,
[0:14:11] SPEAKER_01: this is my job.
[0:14:12] SPEAKER_01: Right now I'm worried about blah, blah, blah.
[0:14:14] SPEAKER_01: You make it into these large trends about what your life is right now.
[0:14:20] SPEAKER_01: That's the present.
[0:14:21] SPEAKER_01: Here is the ongoing moment.
[0:14:25] Unknown: If you push play on a movie, the movie's going to keep moving.
[0:14:30] SPEAKER_01: It's not a frozen screen of the woman in her apartment worrying about paying the electric
[0:14:34] SPEAKER_01: bill for a whole movie.
[0:14:37] SPEAKER_01: It moves.
[0:14:38] SPEAKER_01: That continuous here-ness, which is always ongoing, it can't be shrink-wrapped, it can't
[0:14:46] SPEAKER_01: be put in the time capsule, this forever and ever.
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_01: That is the now.
[0:14:52] Unknown: For me that's been such a helpful differentiation because I do the stuck in the present thing
[0:14:59] SPEAKER_01: and I ping pong between past and future all the time too just like anyone with an ego
[0:15:04] Unknown: structure does.
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_01: There's a way that the spiritual path can become quite depressing if we think what we
[0:15:11] SPEAKER_01: need to do is just soften into whatever we've decided our present is and say this is just
[0:15:17] SPEAKER_01: my life now.
[0:15:18] Unknown: I'm going to be the spiritual person who tolerates that this forever and ever.
[0:15:24] SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can even share a little more about it because when I'm listening I guess some
[0:15:28] Unknown: of the confusion is.
[0:15:32] SPEAKER_00: So possibly, and I'm now just talking out loud so I can sort through it in my head just
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_00: in case anyone else has a question.
[0:15:42] SPEAKER_00: So let's say we're suffering big time in this moment.
[0:15:47] SPEAKER_00: One can imagine that perhaps we have really rough conditions in this moment.
[0:15:53] SPEAKER_00: So really rough external circumstances.
[0:15:58] SPEAKER_00: And so not to say that every external circumstances that is rough will necessarily create suffering
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_00: but I mean who are we all kidding?
[0:16:05] SPEAKER_00: For most of us listening if our external circumstances get rough enough we're probably going to suffer.
[0:16:12] SPEAKER_00: And then the other is we keep projecting concepts and since those are born of the past that's
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: what I think is interesting about the here and the present conversation because if you're
[0:16:25] SPEAKER_00: really suffering then either the external conditions are like pressing in on you possibly.
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_00: Maybe your body is really out of alignment could be something physiological that's creating
[0:16:36] Unknown: but even then often what's happening I think is your brain keeps projecting the past onto
[0:16:45] SPEAKER_00: the present moment.
[0:16:46] Unknown: So in theory once we become present to this moment to now to hear whatever language we
[0:16:55] SPEAKER_00: want to use we can begin to see through those projections and then actually meet the pain
[0:17:00] SPEAKER_00: and a whole new thing can evolve.
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_00: So maybe if you share how it was helpful for you it'll clarify it a little bit.
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_01: How the Locke-Kelley's clarification of that.
[0:17:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah it's still pointing to what I think Amodama probably other teachers calls the
[0:17:18] SPEAKER_01: horizontal mind which is you're going to the past you're projecting it on the present but
[0:17:23] SPEAKER_01: really this is my life now is a projection onto the future too meaning it will always
[0:17:29] SPEAKER_01: be like this.
[0:17:30] Unknown: This flavor will always be here.
[0:17:35] Unknown: So it still relies on past and future and so there's just a way that the present becomes
[0:17:41] SPEAKER_01: this larger shape like broader trends that are completely dependent like you were saying
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_01: on thought forms about the past and the future and not about whatever we're actually experiencing
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_01: in the moment.
[0:17:56] Unknown: So you know to give an example when I was triggered recently about house hunting stuff
[0:18:03] SPEAKER_01: and I'll go into the story but I went hiking and like it's such a great moment because
[0:18:10] SPEAKER_01: for me connection with nature is such an important part of my life and it's always so opening
[0:18:15] SPEAKER_01: and grounding and delightful so it's easy for me to see that I'm blinded to that.
[0:18:21] SPEAKER_01: So I can be sitting next to a running stream and instead of ooh the water feels cool on
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_01: my hand the light looks so pretty on the stream the sun feels so good on my skin I'm sitting
[0:18:33] Unknown: next to this miraculous experience and I'm going oh my god I hope I'm not making a mistake.
[0:18:40] Unknown: Last time I tried to move I hope I know oh my god this would be disaster I hope it doesn't
[0:18:45] Unknown: but I wonder if it's just thought forms and you're missing I saw Jeannie Zandi for a night
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_01: recently and she has like the most I know we have to catch up on that it was so good.
[0:18:56] SPEAKER_01: She has the most luscious language of any human being ever I think.
[0:19:01] SPEAKER_00: She's so poetic.
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_01: And so she was talking about this hiking and just talking the phrase she used is like missing
[0:19:08] SPEAKER_01: the feast that you can be out in the feast walking sun leaves air company whatever and
[0:19:20] SPEAKER_01: you can completely miss it because you're in thought forms and that's everything that
[0:19:25] SPEAKER_01: every spiritual teacher is talking about and it's what we're talking about here too.
[0:19:30] Unknown: So the now is a much I don't know why I say bigger or smaller it just feels that way
[0:19:36] SPEAKER_01: because it's not painted with a broad brush it's experientially happening ongoing like
[0:19:42] SPEAKER_01: pushing play on the movie like the stream is moving the water is moving the light is
[0:19:46] SPEAKER_01: glinting and the sun's hitting my skin and then maybe a person comes along and they say
[0:19:50] SPEAKER_01: hi now this is what's happening now I'm having a conversation with this person and then they
[0:19:53] SPEAKER_01: leave and then I see a fish and then I stand up like it's ongoing and it's very small.
[0:19:59] SPEAKER_00: And in a way part of being here is recognizing everything's changing right literally changing
[0:20:05] SPEAKER_00: moment by moment and nothing you're experiencing have you ever experienced before like ever which
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_00: is really a trip right I can have a same conversation with you we're talking about the awakening nervous
[0:20:17] SPEAKER_00: system again and it's it'll never be like it was before I'm not the same you are not the same the
[0:20:24] SPEAKER_00: energy's not you know that's what's really interesting that's part of what our brains
[0:20:29] Unknown: or we could say ego structure struggle around acknowledging that things don't repeat and they're
[0:20:40] SPEAKER_00: not forever encapsulated and now it will always be like this even when it's a beautiful moment
[0:20:46] SPEAKER_00: sitting by a stream trickling right so interesting. And to go back to that not to you know beat this
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_01: to death but just because I gave examples of past present thought forms sitting next to the stream
[0:20:56] Unknown: but you can also just what I would do in the present as a concept as opposed to the here or
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_01: now it would be sitting next to the stream going this is one of the hardest times of my life I
[0:21:09] SPEAKER_01: don't know if I'll make the right decision why can't it work out you know that's present that's
[0:21:16] SPEAKER_01: thinking about the present moment but it's not what's actually happening is you're sitting next
[0:21:21] SPEAKER_01: to a stream it doesn't mean you're not going to go home and whatever make a hard phone call or
[0:21:26] SPEAKER_01: tough decision but it's not happening right now and really the pain even in the moments when we
[0:21:31] Unknown: do make the decision or make the hard phone call or whatever those are tiny moments too we just
[0:21:39] SPEAKER_01: make them feel like giant shrink-wrapped moments that are filled with all this this is the hardest
[0:21:45] SPEAKER_00: this is the worst this is the hardest all that well maybe we can lay out a couple of concepts and
[0:21:50] Unknown: then we can give personal examples I remember learning a long time ago that the way that the
[0:21:57] SPEAKER_00: brain functions is it essentially projects the past onto the present in the future especially
[0:22:04] SPEAKER_00: if it's in its default mode network right as soon as it's in its default architecture and these
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_00: aspects of the brain that are trying to reduce the load and reduce the use of resources it just
[0:22:16] SPEAKER_00: keeps working from the architecture of the past and looking for what feels familiar and then based
[0:22:22] SPEAKER_00: on the level of familiarity categorizing it as good bad safe unsafe and so unless we're in the
[0:22:30] Unknown: here the brain has a way of painting the present and the future with the past right so then what's
[0:22:41] Unknown: interesting I think is as I listen to Neelam what started to connect for me is so let's say I might
[0:22:50] SPEAKER_00: have used this example before when I was an acupuncture student and I was in the clinic
[0:22:55] Unknown: studying I had a good friend of mine who had a beard and he was a practitioner super nice guy
[0:23:03] SPEAKER_00: I love this guy like really friendly you're really lovely superwoman loving like really good human
[0:23:10] SPEAKER_00: being and this female patient that he was seeing immediately did not like him and did not want to
[0:23:16] SPEAKER_00: see him because she had had a past trauma with a man with a beard right and it's as simple as that
[0:23:21] SPEAKER_00: sometimes we're sort of lucky I'm using that word very loosely enough to identify the trigger
[0:23:28] SPEAKER_00: right like this is familiar and it's familiar to this and so even though I know you're not that
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_00: person I really can't seem to be around you without my nervous system interacting but sometimes we're
[0:23:42] SPEAKER_00: not familiar think about how many things you don't have top of mind in your memory bank that could
[0:23:48] SPEAKER_00: have happened to you so what Neelam was pointing to that I thought was really interesting is in
[0:23:54] SPEAKER_00: moments like that when something has this familiar tone to it and it triggers the brain and the
[0:24:00] SPEAKER_00: nervous system to go this is familiar the nervous system will respond oftentimes the way it responded
[0:24:06] SPEAKER_00: then so if it froze if it placated if it you know if it ran either way it's often a sense of
[0:24:15] SPEAKER_00: overwhelm or shutdown if we were to just make it more broad and categorical but I thought that's
[0:24:23] SPEAKER_00: really interesting so there's some trigger of something being familiar your brain goes oh I
[0:24:28] SPEAKER_00: know what this is this is just like this thing I saw before it assigns good or bad which sometimes
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_00: it assigns good to things that are not good for us because it felt familiar in our past like you
[0:24:42] SPEAKER_00: could have a date you could start dating someone and the way they treat you treated you is kind of
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_00: like how your parent treated you and you associated that with love and it feels familiar so you could
[0:24:51] SPEAKER_00: say okay that's good or you could say it's bad but either way we've already created a projection
[0:24:58] SPEAKER_00: on the moment we've already decided something about what this will mean and who they are and
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: what the roles will be we've already decided something and so I think once we recognize that
[0:25:14] SPEAKER_00: and we start to go deeper and go oh and my nervous system is basically responding the way it responded
[0:25:22] SPEAKER_00: so what Neelam was saying is in those moments and this is a great simplification but just to give
[0:25:28] Unknown: you this important information open your eyes and take in data from the room around you let your
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_00: brain fill up with information that it is not in that past moment because the brain can't differentiate
[0:25:43] SPEAKER_00: thinks the past has come to life again so look around take it in feel the senses in your body
[0:25:50] SPEAKER_00: because the senses are a gateway to the now experience and then you'll start to shift and
[0:25:56] SPEAKER_00: then from that place you'll also have discernment and you can meet these emotions and experiences
[0:26:02] Unknown: in an entirely different way yeah and in case this sounds so tidy like oh good I have the
[0:26:10] Unknown: blueprint for how to never be trigger right out of it I would like to share we wouldn't want it
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_01: to sound tidy no not so tight so I recently am going through something that is like one of the
[0:26:27] SPEAKER_01: human life's most common most banal things which is just house hunting and moving right like it's
[0:26:33] SPEAKER_01: really ordinary except I have some triggers like really old-school childhood very unpleasant PTSD
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_01: triggers around moving and everything about it making a decision to move will I make the right
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_01: decision if I make the wrong decision I will permanently and irreversibly ruin not just my
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_01: life but everyone I loves life like it has that kind of thing so without without being conscious
[0:27:04] SPEAKER_01: of that at all I didn't go into it going now Brooke remember you have triggers around moving
[0:27:08] SPEAKER_01: this might get rocky nope instead I surprised myself with the level of totally illogical terror
[0:27:18] SPEAKER_01: like animal brainstem terror about a move and inability to do what I coach people to do all
[0:27:27] SPEAKER_01: the time which is to discern so I feel like I got this very painful but really interesting
[0:27:34] Unknown: really wonderful tour through being profoundly triggered like PTSD triggering which I haven't
[0:27:43] SPEAKER_01: had that level of it in in many years and when you and I were talking before the show you were
[0:27:48] SPEAKER_01: like you know what this reminded me of is when you were going through and I'm like I know it's been
[0:27:54] Unknown: so long since I've been in that place and what's interesting about now is that what I do have is
[0:28:01] Unknown: awareness so even though I had awareness I'm really triggered I'm really terrified and yet
[0:28:10] SPEAKER_01: nothing terrifying is happening at all I'm telling myself stories about the past and the
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_01: future I was aware of all of those things I was aware of how profoundly self-absorbed I became
[0:28:24] SPEAKER_01: that because when you're terrified and it feels like a survival issue it's all you care about you
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_01: can't think about or talk about anything else and you're become super needy with the people around
[0:28:33] SPEAKER_01: you because it's like that's it has to be solved or you will die you know the only thing you want
[0:28:39] Unknown: to talk about I was aware of all of those things and I have lots of tools and I just couldn't get
[0:28:48] SPEAKER_01: out of it because it went into you know for those of you listening who have been through
[0:28:53] Unknown: and experienced PTSD they're just these kind of this isn't actually anatomically what's happening
[0:28:59] SPEAKER_01: but it feels like these deep folds in the brain and something can get caught in there and it's
[0:29:03] Unknown: like you know to unhook it it's tough so fortunately at the same time that that was
[0:29:10] SPEAKER_01: happening I mean I have the love and support of people like you and the rest of my community
[0:29:15] SPEAKER_01: and great tools and that helped but I still it was so like a hair's breadth away that I could go
[0:29:20] Unknown: into this like not particularly functional terrified place and I came across my friend
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_01: Liam Bowler who does the podcast the body awake he did an interview with a man Stanley Rosenberg
[0:29:33] SPEAKER_01: who talks about the Dr. Stephen Pore just came out with the polyvagal theory and so this man
[0:29:40] SPEAKER_01: Stanley Rosenberg put together a book of just self-help for regulating your vagus nerve so I
[0:29:48] SPEAKER_01: am NOT an expert on the polyvagal theory so even though I'm a body nerd and I did liberated body
[0:29:53] SPEAKER_01: I am NOT speaking from the place of please let me explain this theory to you what I'm saying is
[0:29:58] SPEAKER_01: that as a person who was grateful to listen to Liam's podcast it really illuminated some things
[0:30:05] SPEAKER_01: for me in terms of awareness and then it also gave me tools so first in terms of awareness
[0:30:10] SPEAKER_01: there is the dorsal vagal branch and for those of us who've experienced PTSD there's a way that
[0:30:19] SPEAKER_01: you can get caught in that dorsal vagal activity which is immobilization and it has its freeze
[0:30:27] SPEAKER_01: you picture the scared animal on the forest floor freezing and that's true that's immobilization
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_01: but in a human life it can also be just laying around in your house feeling terrified and you
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_01: know you're laying around your house terrified but you can't unhook from it no matter how good
[0:30:41] Unknown: your intentions and so it helped for me to pull it out of a lot of the thought forms of why can't
[0:30:51] SPEAKER_01: I why can't I disrupt this what's wrong with me blah blah as soon as I can see it as like this
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_01: physiological fact which I kind of this vague understanding of before but it was like oh god
[0:31:01] Unknown: what a relief like I always go to that default because my nervous system got wired that way at
[0:31:07] SPEAKER_01: a really young age like helpful information even more helpful we're using these really simple
[0:31:15] SPEAKER_01: techniques for regulating the nervous system which I those of you listening I will link to exactly
[0:31:20] SPEAKER_01: what the book is and hopefully he has a video but there's this one very basic exercise I thought
[0:31:26] SPEAKER_01: of you Vanessa because I think ultimately what he's doing what you do is you interlace your hands you
[0:31:31] Unknown: put them behind your head you're laying down and without turning your head you look to the right
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_01: until you take a settling breath or swallow and then you do the same looking to the left and
[0:31:41] SPEAKER_01: ultimately I think what it's trying to do based on what I knew know about the body is to adjust the
[0:31:46] Unknown: atlas and I thought of you with your nuka treatments and how when he was on the wrong side and it was
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: so interesting because when I was really in terror and I first started doing the exercise I know that
[0:31:59] Unknown: I'm always out on the right but I wasn't thinking about it so I did the exercise I looked to the
[0:32:06] Unknown: right just with my eyes and I went into shake like shaking terrified animal I was like this is
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_01: now full at all so I was like okay I'm gonna look to the left as soon as I look to the left my whole
[0:32:20] Unknown: system just calmed down and so I and then I was able to look to the right and I didn't get the
[0:32:27] Unknown: super triggered response so I started doing this daily and I said this to you before Vanessa it's
[0:32:37] Unknown: like recovering from the flu you know like you can't if you have the flu you can't tell yourself
[0:32:43] Unknown: it's just a virus heal yeah but if the physiological state of the fever has broken flu has broken comes
[0:32:55] Unknown: along you feel relief and this was like oh my I finally have access again to sanity I mean I wasn't
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_01: like a screaming running around the neighborhood person but just discernment but you couldn't
[0:33:08] Unknown: discern merely no like just to go okay and it and I was able to tell myself before you are not
[0:33:16] SPEAKER_01: seeing clearly this isn't true but it didn't matter because I still felt terrified but this was first
[0:33:21] Unknown: the terrified went away and then it was like okay now I can discern about what's going on in my life
[0:33:29] SPEAKER_01: you know am I in imminent danger I notice now that I have been able to settle my nervous system
[0:33:35] SPEAKER_01: that I'm not and it just I mean it was a fascinating experience for so many reasons like to have
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_01: awareness and go through that kind of trigger because it lasts all the other times in my life
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_01: that I have I haven't had that level of awareness and then to have tools that so quickly put me into
[0:33:50] Unknown: a different place um really fascinating and it really gets me thinking about um
[0:34:00] SPEAKER_01: I think a lot of us listening understand that we have sensitive nervous systems and some of us
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_01: listening know that we have experiences with PTSD and like we need different care and feeding
[0:34:11] Unknown: we need to make it a priority in our lives and not in the calm down self-soothing kind of ways
[0:34:19] SPEAKER_01: but I mean how do we become as resilient adaptable well regulated flexible pliable in our nervous
[0:34:29] Unknown: systems as possible as opposed to the like because the sympathetic parasympathetic story
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_01: is binary right up regulate down regulate and then it's very even though that's just a normal
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: function of the nervous system thank god we can do both people tell a story about how one's better
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_01: than the other they're both equally good they're they're just keeping you alive they're just taking
[0:34:48] Unknown: care of the organism you know um so this put took it into a different place where it wasn't just
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_01: like are you in the good one or the bad ones you need to calm down or speed up it was like no what
[0:35:01] SPEAKER_01: immobilization is immobilization and then how do I get more flexible
[0:35:06] Unknown: okay now I have a million things I know I I over talked again no that was awesome and I'm like this
[0:35:12] Unknown: and then this got my I'm actually got my energy rolling um I remember back in the day and then I
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_00: don't know when that was since I have bad memory but maybe it's five years ago 10 years ago whatever
[0:35:27] SPEAKER_00: I remember being obsessed with resiliency in the nervous system I mean I used to teach a lot about
[0:35:32] SPEAKER_00: the nervous system and the window of tolerance and how to increase our window of tolerance and
[0:35:37] SPEAKER_00: then somewhere I think I got this sense like that's not very spiritual like you know that's
[0:35:43] SPEAKER_00: yeah like it seemed always very neurobiological and physiological and helpful for things like
[0:35:50] SPEAKER_00: stress management like not bad not unuseful but like oh okay no but now let me go to a spiritual
[0:35:57] SPEAKER_00: path and like right you know it's different do Buddhist practices and read things right and I
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_00: just had that different because you know as I think I said with Lock Kelly like when I thought
[0:36:06] Unknown: about spirituality it's always you know like what are we really like who are we what's the point of
[0:36:12] SPEAKER_00: humans existing and what happens after we die like that's my question so it wasn't even like
[0:36:19] SPEAKER_00: I was always trying to awaken you know that wasn't even on my mind I'm sure if that was I
[0:36:24] SPEAKER_00: might have gotten into different physiological practices like they use in yoga all the time
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_00: kundalini practices and breathing practices so I had it like so divided so I always think it's
[0:36:35] SPEAKER_00: funny now that I keep like oh that thing that I was studying and talking about is actually
[0:36:41] Unknown: really important in the spiritual path but what I was thinking about a lot of things actually when
[0:36:48] SPEAKER_00: you were talking brick but one of them was am I remembering correctly here's something that came
[0:36:52] SPEAKER_00: into my mind I feel like when you spoke with Jeannie Zandi about some of the terror that was
[0:36:58] SPEAKER_00: coming up for you at night and we're calling it dark night of the soul but that when that was
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_00: happening I feel like at some point Jeannie said something along the lines of and way more poetically
[0:37:11] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure but like sometimes it's not about meeting the terror like you don't meet the terror don't
[0:37:17] SPEAKER_00: you know oftentimes if people listen to us they know we're often about like how can we meet this
[0:37:22] SPEAKER_00: energy that's in our body this emotion in our body it was like stop meeting it you can't you
[0:37:27] SPEAKER_00: have to first find ground like first find safety yeah right laughing because I'm like I should go
[0:37:32] SPEAKER_01: back and listen should have listened to that after the fact yeah that would have been a good reminder
[0:37:37] SPEAKER_01: just keep turning towards terror maybe not helpful when you have PTSD and you immobilize
[0:37:43] Unknown: right right like there's a certain degree it's making me think that you know there's a degree
[0:37:50] Unknown: of getting caught into the past you know just to put it that way for now that is probably so deep
[0:38:00] SPEAKER_00: so visceral so contracted that there is literally almost no discernment right like almost no
[0:38:07] Unknown: capacity for this recent tour no capacity for discernment no capacity for discernment even if
[0:38:13] SPEAKER_00: you have witnessing self and observing self still no capacity for actual discernment meaning ability
[0:38:19] SPEAKER_00: to shift and disidentify and like have a new perspective and have a new experience and so
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_00: by coming back to safety which could also be described as doing these practices to soften
[0:38:32] SPEAKER_00: the vagal nerve or tone the vagal nerve I don't know the right terminology shifting into the
[0:38:37] SPEAKER_00: parasympathetic if you're listening to Locke he might talk about unhooking from something
[0:38:42] Unknown: and shifting into awareness so that's really interesting for certain emotions
[0:38:50] Unknown: or maybe it's fair to say just for certain states when you're that contracted in it when it's that
[0:38:57] SPEAKER_00: hooked you can't just do what we would normally recommend which is meet it first and this is what
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_00: I think Neelam was saying first you have to be able to be here if you can't recognize that you're
[0:39:11] SPEAKER_00: here you know so often like what you were describing sitting by the stream or you know in bed at night
[0:39:18] SPEAKER_00: we can sometimes experience emotions or we're sitting in our house on the couch ruminating
[0:39:24] SPEAKER_00: if we really were to breathe with our eyes open and look around and take in the surroundings of
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_00: the present moment we don't have the problems we think we have often right it's not the emergency
[0:39:36] Unknown: we think it is it's not as familiar as we had automatically assumed it was so I think that that's
[0:39:47] Unknown: a really interesting thing it's like okay sometimes it's like duh it's almost always like duh
[0:39:55] SPEAKER_00: like how many times do you have to like learn the same thing before we own it but I remember
[0:40:01] Unknown: studying self-compassion work with Kristin Neff have you ever oh yeah look at her stuff yeah
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_00: oh she's really lovely for anyone listening who's grappling with self-compassion Kristin Neff has
[0:40:12] SPEAKER_00: it going on and I remember her saying you know so often like let's say um okay I'll give my example
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_00: I this is gonna sound so stupid but I was triggered because my daddy was upset with
[0:40:29] Unknown: why I have to move yeah I know you don't say I don't use the word daddy for everyone listening
[0:40:34] SPEAKER_00: that sounds somehow weird I'm 44 no I was making fun of myself by using that word but what had
[0:40:40] SPEAKER_00: happened was I was coming back to New York to see the family I thought I was planning a very nice
[0:40:45] SPEAKER_00: trip my parents were disappointed I wasn't staying longer and I could feel their disappointment and
[0:40:51] Unknown: they expressed their disappointment my whole physiology got changed right I went right into
[0:41:00] SPEAKER_00: fight or flight kind of mode my mind started racing because all of these sort of um well we
[0:41:08] SPEAKER_00: used to call them pain bodies right we could say triggers we can say states of being whatever they
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_00: are they have thoughts that go with them feelings that go with them and belief systems that go with
[0:41:20] SPEAKER_00: them those are sometimes the trickiest to see so I'm all triggered and now I'm thinking I should
[0:41:27] SPEAKER_00: just kill myself but but meanwhile it's not like I don't like myself I'm into myself now that's
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_00: gone I'm not a problem but that's the thought that comes along with this trigger which you know poor
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_00: little Vanessa no wonder I was like dreaming about killing myself and wishing I could like break my
[0:41:43] SPEAKER_00: legs and someone pay attention to me you know it's like there was I know right
[0:41:51] SPEAKER_00: and and so that kind of thought form is part of what was happening in my nervous system when I
[0:41:57] SPEAKER_00: used to go through whatever traumatic experiences I went through okay so here's what's up my dad's
[0:42:04] SPEAKER_00: disappointed in me I'm empathetically feeling the resonance of the disappointment so that's a piece
[0:42:11] SPEAKER_00: but I'm also projecting like oh he's always going to be upset and now he's hurt and poor guy they're
[0:42:16] Unknown: older right so I'm ascribing all sorts of meaning to it and now I'm anxious and it's in the back of
[0:42:23] SPEAKER_00: my mind all day just like you were describing brooke right like I'm caught in that kind of
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_00: self-absorption loop it's not intense because it's a minor anxiety but it's there right like
[0:42:33] Unknown: anytime someone's not talking to me I'm back into that what am I going to do about this state so
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_00: formerly in my life and what many of you may do is we think all right I'm just going to talk
[0:42:45] SPEAKER_00: myself through it you know how you said like no amount of like hey brooke there's nothing to worry
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_00: about you're just moving houses really there's lots of houses in the world yeah like do it all
[0:42:54] Unknown: the time really not a big deal oh good point yeah like oh great thank you for pointing that out to
[0:42:58] Unknown: me I feel so much better like that doesn't work and I knew this from studying self-compassion with
[0:43:04] SPEAKER_00: Kristin Neff it doesn't work on a brain level it doesn't work on a nervous system level you can't
[0:43:12] SPEAKER_00: rationalize when your brain is triggered into its fear centers or emotional centers like the limbic
[0:43:20] Unknown: system so once your limbic system is activated and the fight flight freeze placate mechanisms
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_00: are running the show you can't access the frontal part of your brain where logic and
[0:43:35] SPEAKER_00: rationality exist you also can't access therefore love compassion forgiveness and all of those
[0:43:41] Unknown: types of really frontal cortex states so what happens is we get into this and then we're like
[0:43:48] SPEAKER_00: it'll be okay Vanessa you're 44 years old like your dad's been disappointed before you know in
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_00: fact no matter how much I do they tend to be in that state so that's just to be expected right
[0:43:59] SPEAKER_00: and I can talk it through but none of it's alleviating the anxiety same thing let's say
[0:44:05] SPEAKER_00: you go well I want to learn a lesson and so self-compassion people are like but you know I did
[0:44:11] SPEAKER_00: the wrong thing I should have thought about it differently and they're trying to talk themselves
[0:44:14] Unknown: through it but what Kristin Neff taught was until you can get out of that reptile brain until you
[0:44:21] SPEAKER_00: can get out of the limbic system and into the frontal cortex you can't access logic reason
[0:44:30] SPEAKER_00: love compassion ease and all of these other places we could say Matt would say you can't access your
[0:44:36] Unknown: soul right La Kelly would say you can't access awake awareness so who knows what it is we can
[0:44:43] Unknown: look at it from different ways so finally it seems that it's always circling back to the first thing
[0:44:51] SPEAKER_00: you have to do before you can meet that experience from the level of awake awareness from the level
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_00: of compassion from the part of you that genuinely can feel it is you first have to soften to safety
[0:45:05] SPEAKER_00: and oh my god how many times have we talked about this brock because kieran was huge on this I know
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_00: I'm safety first find safety but we don't always know what safety looks like or feels like or how
[0:45:16] SPEAKER_00: to find safety which is part of what that tool gave you yeah and when you're in just like
[0:45:21] SPEAKER_01: wounded animal we're not so handy with our self-help tools or whatever you know even in this
[0:45:28] SPEAKER_01: interview on the body awake he was like yeah well you know of course it's not like a permanent fix
[0:45:33] SPEAKER_01: we're alive lives affect us and when people are depressed or when people are triggered
[0:45:39] SPEAKER_01: they're less likely to do their self-care it's like yeah you know it's just a really basic fact but
[0:45:45] SPEAKER_01: if something lands in your lap as it did for me this time quite literally I was like oh that you
[0:45:50] SPEAKER_01: know you can give it a try and it works but yeah it's not always when you're genuinely triggered
[0:45:56] SPEAKER_01: and you like you said don't have access to the parts of your brain that are different levels of
[0:46:00] SPEAKER_01: consciousness more mature levels of consciousness than just base survival what about me I'd better
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: make sure I get out of this thing alive and this thing is usually an idea or concept not even like
[0:46:13] Unknown: in the middle of the battlefield or something it's not the easiest and and then I think because we
[0:46:22] SPEAKER_01: are in the binary part of our brains within a binary culture what we do is we assume we need
[0:46:27] Unknown: to suppress ourselves just calm it down calm it down and it's really not about putting a lid on
[0:46:36] Unknown: ourselves which we've also talked about plenty so I don't know I'm really really interested in
[0:46:46] Unknown: this conversation and experience of what is a nice adaptable flexible nervous system and I know
[0:46:55] Unknown: not alone in my interest but it's just really landed in a way where I'm like okay this has
[0:47:03] Unknown: been a super helpful tool for me in a tough time and it's really changing the way I think
[0:47:09] Unknown: about everything it's the way I think about this path it's the way I think about politics in the
[0:47:16] SPEAKER_01: state of our country it's the way I think about my work with my clients when I'm working as a
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_01: body therapist or manual therapist and like it's not just about convincing the tissue to let go
[0:47:27] SPEAKER_01: by putting a certain kind of pressure on it can we get their nervous system to feel totally
[0:47:33] Unknown: in a safe place first by working on vagal tone so more to come on this because I'm it's one of those
[0:47:42] Unknown: things that landed for me in a like okay this feels really important and relevant and helpful
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_01: and so different than just the binary idea of like wow I'm really revved up I'm afraid I'm
[0:47:55] SPEAKER_01: sympathetic nervous system calm down calm down which just has not when you're somebody who goes
[0:48:00] Unknown: into immobilization that does not feel good it does not help no it goes to a well and and remember
[0:48:07] SPEAKER_00: even that voice is probably just a voice you employed when your nervous system was accelerated
[0:48:12] SPEAKER_00: at some point in the past totally right so even that that's what's crazy someone else may say
[0:48:18] SPEAKER_00: go give them a piece of your mind give them a piece of your mind right like not calm down
[0:48:23] Unknown: you're gonna be fine you're fine rock back and forth and pretend you care what they're talking
[0:48:30] SPEAKER_00: about right like even in that moment there's still the overlays that's what's tricky it's like how
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_00: we're thinking about it and conceiving of it and the meaning we're applying like for example if you
[0:48:41] SPEAKER_00: go I should be able to get myself out of this and I can't get myself out of this therefore I'm a
[0:48:46] SPEAKER_00: defective human being who's always doomed to this right right all just our meaning that we keep
[0:48:52] SPEAKER_00: applying I mean I think it's just interesting because there's just so many ways to come about
[0:48:57] SPEAKER_00: it because it's a mystery because ultimately we are mysteries you know us human beings are mysteries
[0:49:03] SPEAKER_00: and and maybe there's just different medicine for different people at different moments but when I
[0:49:08] Unknown: think about spending time with kieran for example speaking about pain bodies and and the architecture
[0:49:15] Unknown: of our belief systems and sort of using Byron Katie style reality testing questions with it
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_00: that's useful because then when you're in a reactive state you have some measure of ability
[0:49:29] SPEAKER_00: to have been observing self with the types of beliefs that are running through your mind that
[0:49:32] SPEAKER_00: actually just aren't true and now you might know they're not true you might remember right you
[0:49:37] SPEAKER_00: might have a seed so that's helpful and then doing genies andy's benevolent thief meditation where
[0:49:43] SPEAKER_00: you're just finding safety in the now is helpful and the alums keeping your eyes closed so
[0:49:48] SPEAKER_00: everyone's going to find their kind of own way in and to keep practicing but I do believe
[0:49:56] Unknown: that as we keep finding the capacity to be in the present which is possibly
[0:50:06] SPEAKER_00: possibly when Eckhart Tolle would talk about being here you know like or we'd get the concept like
[0:50:12] SPEAKER_00: oh yeah be here now that sounds so nice not so easy right not so easy that these reactivities
[0:50:19] Unknown: they are intergenerational they are possibly karmic past life and they are certainly in our
[0:50:26] SPEAKER_00: own lives in our own traumas in our own past so maybe not so easy to develop the bandwidth to be
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_00: here because if we are present we're going to feel all the feels that's part of being present
[0:50:38] Unknown: right it's part of why we we shut down out of overwhelm but I do believe that as that capacity
[0:50:45] Unknown: develops even if it's a little at a time right like you can be present with one emotion but not
[0:50:51] SPEAKER_00: a different kind with one thing but not a different thing that as we keep developing that capacity
[0:50:56] SPEAKER_00: that eventually I do think we start to clear out these reactivities and then those tools you and
[0:51:03] SPEAKER_00: I have said this in different ways about different things those tools just become
[0:51:08] SPEAKER_00: either irrelevant or part of us you know what I mean like you don't need to default to them like
[0:51:13] Unknown: I don't have to sit around MatCon offers a beautiful parasympathetic soothing kind of
[0:51:20] SPEAKER_00: exercise by simply putting your hands on your heart and saying I love you super great super
[0:51:26] SPEAKER_00: oxytocin inducing really good for us after a while you don't even have to do that anymore because
[0:51:32] SPEAKER_00: you love yourself yeah it's just there right so I think and I think honestly when all those
[0:51:38] Unknown: reactivities are cleared out I think that's when you're stabilized in awakened state yeah I think
[0:51:44] SPEAKER_01: so too which is just endlessly fascinating me to see how this is a parallel thing like you were
[0:51:49] SPEAKER_01: saying before it's not like the spiritual path's over there and the maturation and flexibility of
[0:51:55] Unknown: the nervous system is over here same same they are the same thing I think I think I stay tuned
[0:52:01] SPEAKER_01: that's where that's where we're at highly interrelated we can say well they're definitely
[0:52:06] SPEAKER_00: high I've been seeing it all year you're seeing it all year how how the two are dancing with
[0:52:11] SPEAKER_00: each other we're no experts there are people listening who are probably more expert I have a
[0:52:15] SPEAKER_00: lovely client who's a listener who does so well with this stuff maybe I'll ask her if I can
[0:52:20] SPEAKER_00: share her resource but I want to share one simple little exercise that someone I was friends with
[0:52:28] SPEAKER_00: who's now passed away used to offer because it really had me thinking about Neelam but he was
[0:52:33] SPEAKER_00: really coming from an energy perspective Neelam speaks a lot about the neurobiology of it but
[0:52:41] Unknown: he used to say when people seemed really triggered he would have you look around the room
[0:52:50] SPEAKER_00: and start to notice no let me begin again what he would really start with is you would say your
[0:52:55] Unknown: name right so I'd say like I'm Vanessa Anne Scotto you would say your age I'm 44 years old he'd say
[0:53:03] Unknown: where are you right now say I'm in a bedroom in Austin Texas and he would say now look around
[0:53:09] SPEAKER_00: the room and describe it what's the light like what's the color like what is the temperature
[0:53:14] SPEAKER_00: feel like on your skin you know what can you be aware of in your surroundings and you would start
[0:53:19] Unknown: to describe you know everything you know what I see some natural sunlight and the air feels a
[0:53:24] Unknown: little cool on my skin and you would come into the present moment come into the now and you would
[0:53:33] Unknown: start to settle which is really interesting and I found that useful and I found him using it with
[0:53:40] SPEAKER_00: clients again that it's back just based on what Neelam taught us about having the eyes open like
[0:53:46] SPEAKER_00: so often when I meditate as a sensei I like interoception I close my eyes I can have all
[0:53:52] SPEAKER_00: sorts of wild experiences that way but the brain doesn't have that opportunity to catch up to be in
[0:53:58] SPEAKER_00: the present with whatever's arising and it's only when we could be in the present and I know you use
[0:54:05] SPEAKER_00: that term differently you know so I don't want to confuse everybody but the now with whatever's
[0:54:09] Unknown: arising that then it can be set free like then it can heal and we can start to tolerate all of these
[0:54:17] SPEAKER_00: different triggers so we can reduce the reactivities in our system and I think that's
[0:54:23] Unknown: just a pretty easy helpful tool yeah it's a good one thank you so much for listening to today's
