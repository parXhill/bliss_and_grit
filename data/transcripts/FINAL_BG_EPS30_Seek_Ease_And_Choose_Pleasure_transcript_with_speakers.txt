[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls.
[0:00:08] SPEAKER_00: You are listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:09] SPEAKER_00: I'm Brooke Thomas and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:15] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're talking about being on the embodied spiritual path and what does
[0:00:18] SPEAKER_00: that actually mean?
[0:00:20] SPEAKER_00: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:23] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes,
[0:00:28] SPEAKER_00: the bliss and the grit that is a human life?
[0:00:32] SPEAKER_00: We're attempting to sort that out for ourselves here on the show.
[0:00:36] SPEAKER_00: So we've had a good number of episodes lately that are about the more challenging emotions,
[0:00:42] SPEAKER_00: things like grief and despair or heartbreak.
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_00: And we've really dug into how to feel all the feels, especially those ones that we'd
[0:00:50] Unknown: like to avoid and particularly in our culture that we are pretty avoidant of.
[0:00:57] SPEAKER_00: A funny thing though, so for all of our happiness chasing, we're actually not exactly whizzes
[0:01:01] SPEAKER_00: at pointing the compass towards ease or true pleasure either.
[0:01:07] SPEAKER_00: So the same striving that keeps us chasing happiness keeps us from actually resting into
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_00: the more delicious and delightful parts of being human.
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_00: So lest you think we're glorifying suffering, in today's episode we're talking about navigating
[0:01:23] Unknown: towards some of the more yummy, yummy parts of life.
[0:01:27] SPEAKER_00: So leaning into the bliss a little bit more than the grit today.
[0:01:32] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, it would be fantastic if you wanted to leave a review for us, you
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_00: can do that on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit.
[0:01:41] SPEAKER_00: And you can also head over to the website, which is blissandgrit.com and subscribe there
[0:01:45] SPEAKER_00: to hear updates on upcoming events.
[0:01:47] SPEAKER_00: We don't have any official news, but we will certainly be doing something in person this
[0:01:53] SPEAKER_00: summer.
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_00: Right now we're trying to make it for the early part of the summer, but you know, talking
[0:01:57] SPEAKER_00: with people about spaces and stuff.
[0:01:59] SPEAKER_00: So if you subscribe there, you will be able to hear about that just as soon as we know
[0:02:05] SPEAKER_00: dates and information.
[0:02:07] SPEAKER_00: One last thing before we head into the conversation, we have potty mouths, we do swear spontaneously.
[0:02:14] SPEAKER_00: So if you're at work or if there are children around, you might want to wear headphones.
[0:02:18] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:21] Unknown: Hello there.
[0:02:24] Unknown: Good morning.
[0:02:26] SPEAKER_00: I had an interaction with one of my clients this week where I found myself giving her
[0:02:30] SPEAKER_00: the advice.
[0:02:31] Unknown: I heard myself saying to her, seek ease and choose pleasure.
[0:02:36] SPEAKER_00: And then I started kind of laughing to myself on the inside because I said it basically
[0:02:40] SPEAKER_00: on the day that we were putting out one of our episodes that was like grief and despair.
[0:02:47] SPEAKER_00: How do you face your own shit?
[0:02:51] SPEAKER_00: How do you go really face the things?
[0:02:54] SPEAKER_00: And I realized like I give this advice to people a lot.
[0:02:57] SPEAKER_00: You know, seek ease, seek pleasure, seek delicious to use a word from Kieran Trace, our mentor.
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_00: And I want to make sure that all of our conversations that we're having don't start to glorify
[0:03:11] SPEAKER_00: suffering because that's another ego trick that is very common.
[0:03:17] SPEAKER_00: That we can be glorifying the suffering so much that we forget that we actually want
[0:03:22] Unknown: to not just lean into that new identity.
[0:03:28] SPEAKER_00: So when this happened with this client, I was talking to her and she was asking me about
[0:03:32] SPEAKER_00: a particular issue and how she could work with it.
[0:03:36] SPEAKER_00: And I said, I was giving her the advice, you know, have you tried meditating?
[0:03:39] Unknown: And I saw her go, yeah, I know.
[0:03:44] SPEAKER_00: She's like, I know, I know, you're right.
[0:03:48] SPEAKER_00: I have to do that.
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[0:03:50] SPEAKER_00: Like that's not what I'm saying.
[0:03:51] Unknown: I'm not saying, hey, get it together.
[0:03:55] SPEAKER_00: Put this other arduous, awful, hateful thing on your to do list and force yourself to do
[0:04:02] SPEAKER_00: it and get it right.
[0:04:04] SPEAKER_00: But like it immediately gets taken that way.
[0:04:06] SPEAKER_00: I was like, oh, no, no, no, no.
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_00: So the whole game here with meditation is like, how do we surrender into our lives?
[0:04:15] Unknown: And surrender doesn't come from a place of like, sit up straight, don't have a thought,
[0:04:21] SPEAKER_00: not having a thought, having a thought, oh, no thought.
[0:04:24] SPEAKER_00: And like have to do it for 30 minutes, time we didn't go off yet.
[0:04:27] SPEAKER_00: And like we've all had those moments of meditation, I certainly have.
[0:04:30] Unknown: But how can we set our compass to places that allow us to explore ease, flow?
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_00: You know, certainly there are a lot of spiritual traditions that point towards surrendering
[0:04:43] SPEAKER_00: into flow being the whole enchilada.
[0:04:47] SPEAKER_00: And how can we experience pleasure and just make sure to catch ourselves that we're not
[0:04:54] SPEAKER_00: glorifying suffering?
[0:04:56] SPEAKER_00: It's definitely one of my pain bodies.
[0:04:58] SPEAKER_00: So I wanted to make sure that we got into that.
[0:05:02] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so we're basically going to talk about choosing pleasure and ease.
[0:05:10] SPEAKER_01: I like it.
[0:05:11] SPEAKER_01: You know, I like it.
[0:05:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're better at it than I am.
[0:05:15] Unknown: You've been my guru that way many times.
[0:05:17] SPEAKER_01: Oh my God, I am all for delicious and wonderful.
[0:05:21] Unknown: Yeah, you know, you spoke about your pain body, let's say historically being prone
[0:05:28] SPEAKER_01: towards identifying with the suffering.
[0:05:30] SPEAKER_01: And mine would go in exactly the opposite direction and identify overly much with the
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_01: pleasure, right?
[0:05:36] SPEAKER_01: So I guess we have something to teach each other about how we can find the middle path
[0:05:42] SPEAKER_01: as Buddha would say.
[0:05:45] Unknown: So I think it's interesting.
[0:05:48] SPEAKER_01: We have to start to talk about paradox, which is really what bliss and grit was all about,
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_01: right?
[0:05:54] Unknown: That at the very same moment, we have to hold paradox, bliss and grit, form and formless,
[0:06:02] Unknown: levity and gravity, right?
[0:06:07] SPEAKER_01: All of these things exist at once.
[0:06:09] Unknown: So maybe this is a good time to say that what we're really aiming at is that people get
[0:06:16] SPEAKER_01: to be human, present, free, liberated from any contrived movements, liberated from any
[0:06:27] SPEAKER_01: habitual addictive patternings that make you reactive or that leave you in a mode where
[0:06:37] SPEAKER_01: you're trying to control everything, right?
[0:06:39] SPEAKER_01: So for us to be human means just to show up and be present.
[0:06:45] SPEAKER_01: And then in that, there is pleasure and there is pain and there is humor and there is seriousness
[0:06:51] Unknown: and it's just an uncontrived, spontaneous flow, right?
[0:06:58] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:07:00] SPEAKER_00: So when do we catch ourselves in those moments where we're...
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_00: Because that's the whole thing, right?
[0:07:05] SPEAKER_00: Is like awareness, being aware of what our own inclinations and pain bodies are.
[0:07:11] SPEAKER_00: And so like you're saying, you have had the awareness of like, oh, I can really identify
[0:07:19] Unknown: with this pleasure person or maybe dissociate from certain things in life by heading over
[0:07:27] SPEAKER_00: towards pleasure.
[0:07:28] SPEAKER_00: And I will do it the opposite way where I'm just like, you know, I just have to really
[0:07:33] SPEAKER_00: keep getting comfortable with the fact that life is suffering.
[0:07:36] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, really?
[0:07:37] Unknown: Or do you just keep writing it in a way where that's your underlying assumption?
[0:07:44] SPEAKER_00: So catching ourselves is the thing.
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_00: And I think that that moment was so great where I'm like, have you tried meditating?
[0:07:50] SPEAKER_00: It's like, I know, you know, we've all seen that a million times.
[0:07:56] SPEAKER_00: It's like, okay, so there's an assumption.
[0:07:59] SPEAKER_00: There's an assumption in this negative feeling, which is many things, right?
[0:08:06] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm going to hate it.
[0:08:07] SPEAKER_00: It's going to be hard.
[0:08:08] SPEAKER_00: It's going to be uncomfortable.
[0:08:09] SPEAKER_00: I'm not any good at it.
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_00: I have to do it.
[0:08:11] SPEAKER_00: I should do it.
[0:08:12] SPEAKER_00: I should be good at it.
[0:08:13] SPEAKER_00: It's good for me.
[0:08:14] Unknown: You know, it's like all of those things just come in the blink of an eye with that.
[0:08:19] Unknown: Like, yeah, I need to.
[0:08:22] SPEAKER_00: So it's catching that moment, you know, and for this conversation, like in particular,
[0:08:26] Unknown: disrupting it towards if you can look at that and see the underlying assumptions, you're
[0:08:33] Unknown: automatically more human because you're not just going along with the stories that you,
[0:08:41] SPEAKER_00: we, I have been writing for our whole lives about this.
[0:08:44] SPEAKER_00: Well, this is the content of my life, you know, like, yeah, got to lean into suffering,
[0:08:48] Unknown: got to get good at it, got to strive.
[0:08:53] SPEAKER_01: Well I think that part of what happens is all of those thoughts that you're describing
[0:08:59] SPEAKER_01: that can pop in and in a nanosecond, all the judgments and the shame and the feelings
[0:09:04] SPEAKER_01: and all of the expectations that can just kind of flood in in a nanosecond, what they
[0:09:09] SPEAKER_01: also do is they inhibit us from feeling pleasure and then they create a certain experience.
[0:09:15] Unknown: So then when someone does go to sit down to meditate or goes to try a new exercise or
[0:09:22] SPEAKER_01: whatever they're about to approach with all of their thoughts flooding their system like
[0:09:28] SPEAKER_01: that, then they don't experience pleasure doing it.
[0:09:32] Unknown: So it does feel like a task.
[0:09:36] SPEAKER_01: And how do we actually get present?
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_01: Because you know, if we were all to just slow down for one moment here and take nice deep
[0:09:44] Unknown: breaths, it's like, what doesn't feel good about that?
[0:09:50] Unknown: Right?
[0:09:52] SPEAKER_01: Like where's the problem here?
[0:09:54] SPEAKER_01: It's actually a moment by moment situation that is unfolding.
[0:10:01] Unknown: I mean sometimes when I talk to clients, I think that psychology has glorified suffering
[0:10:06] Unknown: quite a bit because we start to associate it with deep thinking, right?
[0:10:13] Unknown: Like we start to associate suffering with I'm being real, suffering with I'm not avoiding
[0:10:19] SPEAKER_01: myself and suffering with like I'm very clever, I'm very intelligent.
[0:10:23] SPEAKER_01: I have deep philosophical thoughts about life, right?
[0:10:28] SPEAKER_01: And the field of psychology has sort of glorified that and maybe spirituality as well.
[0:10:35] SPEAKER_01: I don't really know.
[0:10:37] SPEAKER_01: I'm not really sure.
[0:10:38] SPEAKER_01: But in the end, it's really just probably a lash back to people not paying attention
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_01: to simple human things like their feelings, right?
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_01: So then there's this lash back that happens in the culture where it's like,
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_01: okay, we have to tune in.
[0:10:55] SPEAKER_01: No one ever talks about the feelings of like pleasure or happiness though, do they?
[0:11:00] SPEAKER_00: No, it's funny.
[0:11:01] SPEAKER_00: So like we put out our chasing happiness episode and talked about how much in our
[0:11:06] SPEAKER_00: culture we glorify happiness as a goal and happiness as a right, you know?
[0:11:14] SPEAKER_00: And like it's in our Declaration of Independence.
[0:11:16] SPEAKER_00: And yet we are also a culture, I would say, that very much glorifies suffering.
[0:11:24] SPEAKER_00: Or to use another word, striving.
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_00: And so we're like that perfect dualistic society because we just keep bouncing between
[0:11:36] SPEAKER_00: the two poles and not finding that like juicy middle ground.
[0:11:44] Unknown: All of that space in between the two parts, you know, of the dualism there that like,
[0:11:52] SPEAKER_00: I've got to run towards happiness, no, I've got to run towards efforting and doing and making.
[0:11:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:11:59] SPEAKER_01: And don't you think that I think the part about identity is a really important piece
[0:12:04] SPEAKER_01: that you said before.
[0:12:05] SPEAKER_01: I mean, we've said it in different episodes, but we can identify with anything as in this
[0:12:13] SPEAKER_01: is who I am and this is what life is meant to be like.
[0:12:16] SPEAKER_01: And when we're that identified with a thought, a belief, a vision of who we are,
[0:12:22] SPEAKER_01: there is no space to see anything differently.
[0:12:26] Unknown: So it just feels like the air that you breathe.
[0:12:31] SPEAKER_01: And sometimes that identity gets formed because you had a family unit in which
[0:12:38] SPEAKER_01: suffering was the norm.
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes it gets formed because your family wouldn't feel any feelings.
[0:12:45] SPEAKER_01: And so the act of feeling feelings becomes such a rush because you're moving towards
[0:12:52] SPEAKER_01: truth and you're not hiding anything.
[0:12:54] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:12:56] Unknown: But it's funny how our mind bodies can actually segment what feelings are appropriate and what
[0:13:05] SPEAKER_01: feelings are safe.
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: And that's something you and I have spoken about before.
[0:13:10] SPEAKER_01: If it didn't feel safe for me to feel despair and sadness and grief, I can kind of wall
[0:13:17] SPEAKER_01: that off in favor of the lighter emotions.
[0:13:21] Unknown: If it wasn't safe for you to feel ecstatic and blissful, you can kind of wall that off.
[0:13:28] SPEAKER_01: And although sometimes they think about if you were to like try to turn off an emotion,
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_01: it's sort of like lowering the volume that you can't numb out one, you sort of numb them
[0:13:38] SPEAKER_01: all out.
[0:13:40] Unknown: While I do see that to be true in part, I notice this kind of segmenting of I'm allowed
[0:13:49] SPEAKER_01: to experience this emotion because it is considered safe by me or valued by me and I am not
[0:13:56] SPEAKER_01: allowed to experience this one.
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_01: I think that's a lot of what we've been getting at.
[0:14:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, absolutely.
[0:14:02] Unknown: And I would say that we have very little experience and facility with pleasure, like
[0:14:10] SPEAKER_00: really real pleasure, which as you said, like when you had to slow down and just breathe
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_00: a little like it's totally available.
[0:14:19] SPEAKER_00: It's very simple.
[0:14:21] SPEAKER_00: It can get quite large, you know, the feeling can feel quite big.
[0:14:26] Unknown: If we have containers or bodies that are really overbound and, you know, gripping, clenching,
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_00: and just all those physical dams that we create to all every range of feeling that we have,
[0:14:41] SPEAKER_00: like we can't hold the pleasurable feeling.
[0:14:46] SPEAKER_00: We can't allow it to move through.
[0:14:48] Unknown: Like I oftentimes think about, you know, not tied in a garden hose.
[0:14:53] SPEAKER_00: Like you can't just turn the water on higher.
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_00: You have to untie the garden hose and then it just it's not about forcefulness of the
[0:15:02] SPEAKER_00: water.
[0:15:02] SPEAKER_00: It just flows through because the garden hose is in its appropriate configuration.
[0:15:08] Unknown: But I think we really have more experience with some of the like darker emotions of
[0:15:17] SPEAKER_00: suffering and stuff.
[0:15:18] SPEAKER_00: And then we think that we're getting pleasure when we're actually getting more striving,
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_00: you know, because pleasure usually comes in the form of a future goal.
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_00: You know, in the future tonight, I'm going to have a piece of chocolate cake or go out
[0:15:35] Unknown: to that really nice dinner or that's my dream house.
[0:15:39] SPEAKER_00: I hope one day I can buy that house, you know, and then I'll experience pleasure.
[0:15:45] SPEAKER_00: But I think it's this funny, it's just like we really don't understand pleasure as a
[0:15:51] SPEAKER_00: concept that it's here right now.
[0:15:54] SPEAKER_00: It's always available.
[0:15:57] Unknown: And it can be, you know, quite somatic, like the more unbound my body gets, which goes
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_00: along with my identity getting more and more unbound.
[0:16:05] SPEAKER_00: Like it can just be the most pleasurable thing in the world to just lay on the floor and
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_00: feel how open my body feels.
[0:16:12] SPEAKER_00: That's not something I would have experienced in years past, but then also simple things
[0:16:17] Unknown: like those moments when you are out in the world and then you come to presence like witness
[0:16:25] SPEAKER_00: consciousness and you're like really there and you're like, like everything's so beautiful.
[0:16:33] Unknown: And it was all here the whole time.
[0:16:35] SPEAKER_00: Holy shit.
[0:16:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:16:38] SPEAKER_00: But it is different.
[0:16:39] SPEAKER_01: But it is different.
[0:16:41] SPEAKER_01: I mean, you can experience pleasure in the moment.
[0:16:43] SPEAKER_01: It's not all striving or future based.
[0:16:45] SPEAKER_00: Well, I think pleasure only happens in the moment.
[0:16:47] Unknown: We just get confused.
[0:16:49] SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, even in our culture, I mean, because it's not just thinking about a chocolate
[0:16:53] SPEAKER_01: cake tonight.
[0:16:54] SPEAKER_01: It's like eating a chocolate cake.
[0:16:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, sure.
[0:16:56] Unknown: Like gluttony has its own association with pleasure.
[0:17:01] SPEAKER_01: That was really the pleasure I was good at.
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_01: Not really so much the striving, although let's say thinking about a vacation that was
[0:17:08] SPEAKER_01: coming would get me a little enthusiastic or give me something that I was fantasizing
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_01: about.
[0:17:15] SPEAKER_01: I love fantasy, but most of my pleasure seeking came from gluttony, right?
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_01: Like the food I was going to eat right now and like, mmm, there's chocolate and like,
[0:17:28] SPEAKER_01: oh, this wine and like I'm in Napa and you know, like the sheer decadence of it all.
[0:17:37] SPEAKER_01: And as like a former pleasure junkie, I see what you're saying, Brooke.
[0:17:42] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I experienced it that way.
[0:17:44] Unknown: The simple pleasure of now, like being outside and like smelling the air and feeling the
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_01: breeze.
[0:17:54] Unknown: It's so filling.
[0:17:58] SPEAKER_01: It really is so filling.
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_01: And I still sometimes miss my gluttonous pleasure.
[0:18:03] SPEAKER_00: Well, watching your coffee ritual in the morning is like a religious experience, just
[0:18:09] Unknown: being witness to you talking to your coffee as you put it together.
[0:18:14] SPEAKER_00: Good morning coffee.
[0:18:17] SPEAKER_01: You're delicious.
[0:18:18] SPEAKER_01: I can't wait to drink you.
[0:18:20] Unknown: And it's like crazy.
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes I look at my life and I'm like, how did I get this boring?
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_01: I mean, don't you feel that for some people, people like myself who were pleasure seekers,
[0:18:35] SPEAKER_01: we're also in a way like a sensation seeker, which is funny because I'm not one for really
[0:18:41] SPEAKER_01: sensation seeking activities, like let's say jumping out of a plane, which a lot of sensation
[0:18:46] SPEAKER_01: seekers are, but it is this kind of high level of pleasure stimulus that I'm looking for.
[0:18:54] SPEAKER_01: Now, maybe that points to my tantric wiring, since the tantric Buddhists and the tantric
[0:19:01] SPEAKER_01: yogis were very much about pleasure being something workable, something that you can
[0:19:09] SPEAKER_01: contact direct experience through.
[0:19:13] SPEAKER_01: It was a state actually to be cultivated.
[0:19:17] SPEAKER_01: So maybe it just kind of points to that.
[0:19:19] SPEAKER_01: But then we have these misassociations about what's going to create pleasure.
[0:19:23] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[0:19:24] Unknown: It's like, oh, there's an Indian saint.
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_01: His name is Tagore, T-A-G-O-R-E.
[0:19:31] SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to pronounce it.
[0:19:32] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:19:33] SPEAKER_01: I'll correct this in the resources if I'm wrong.
[0:19:35] Unknown: But he says something about like, the thing is that you're aiming too low with your pleasures.
[0:19:43] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[0:19:43] SPEAKER_01: It's like you should want the world and you're aiming too low.
[0:19:47] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's what's happened to a lot of us in our culture.
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_01: It's like we can probably differentiate between happiness and pleasure, and that would probably
[0:19:57] SPEAKER_01: be useful.
[0:19:58] SPEAKER_01: But we can recognize in some corner of our existence, if not in the vast majority of
[0:20:04] SPEAKER_01: our existence, that pleasure is just this wonderful thing to have because life is short
[0:20:09] Unknown: and it's precious and we should celebrate it.
[0:20:13] SPEAKER_01: And yet what we've come to associate as the causes of pleasure, as the bringers of pleasure,
[0:20:21] Unknown: is kind of a complicated lot because there's nothing implicitly wrong with taking a bite
[0:20:28] SPEAKER_01: of a beautiful chocolate cake that someone baked and it's got love in it.
[0:20:34] SPEAKER_01: And go ahead and take a bite.
[0:20:36] SPEAKER_01: And why would you not enjoy that?
[0:20:38] SPEAKER_01: Like, yum.
[0:20:40] Unknown: But of course, 10 bites in, 15 bites in, then my stomach hurts, then I feel real full, an
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_01: amount of sugar crash, and I kind of hate myself because I'm like, I can't move and
[0:20:57] Unknown: it actually decreases pleasure.
[0:21:00] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:21:02] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, one of the things that I was discovering, so I did Kieran's Delicious Body Course,
[0:21:06] Unknown: which it's really brilliant in the way it's set up because it starts out the first few
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_00: weeks where it's just about your relationship with food and it's that whole principle, right,
[0:21:15] SPEAKER_00: that it's like this isn't about your relationship with food, it is, but it's about your relationship
[0:21:20] SPEAKER_00: to your whole life and food is just the string that we're going to tug to unravel the whole
[0:21:24] SPEAKER_00: ball yarn, you know?
[0:21:26] SPEAKER_00: And one of the pain bodies that I discovered was like the reason why I am eating, you know,
[0:21:33] SPEAKER_00: three pieces of chocolate cake or whatever, you know, in my darker moments is not because
[0:21:39] Unknown: there's a problem with enjoying chocolate cake and that it's not about pleasure is a problem.
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_00: The whole reason why I'm overdoing it is because I believe that the window for pleasure is
[0:21:52] SPEAKER_00: small and I need to get it in while I'm giving myself permission to be out of jail.
[0:21:57] SPEAKER_00: I'm just not just talking about food, I'm talking about in general in my life, you know,
[0:22:01] SPEAKER_00: in all categories.
[0:22:02] SPEAKER_00: And so I'd better enjoy in this little window that I have mentally unconsciously allotted
[0:22:08] SPEAKER_00: for myself as the pleasure window because I know that once I decide time's up, then it's
[0:22:14] SPEAKER_00: back in jail for me, you know, it's back to feeling the hard feelings and life is hard
[0:22:20] SPEAKER_00: and long to do list and, you know, lots of striving and planning.
[0:22:24] SPEAKER_00: And that was really amazing for me because now I can see how that pain body that I had
[0:22:32] SPEAKER_00: better get my moment of pleasure in this tiny window that I've given for myself because
[0:22:36] SPEAKER_00: it's going to close, how that rules every category of my life.
[0:22:42] SPEAKER_00: It's so fascinating and so pleasure is not the overdoing it.
[0:22:46] Unknown: Like this is where we have to like get in to that place in our bodies, get into the actual
[0:22:56] SPEAKER_00: experience, you know, the moment by moment experience of like chocolate cake and then
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_00: when does the tipping point happens?
[0:23:03] SPEAKER_00: Very tricky to catch where the stories start.
[0:23:07] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God, this tastes so good.
[0:23:08] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God, I don't get to have enough pleasure in my life.
[0:23:10] SPEAKER_00: I better hurry up and eat this because once the piece is gone, I'm not going to let myself
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_00: have another piece.
[0:23:14] SPEAKER_00: So and when is the next time that I get to have pleasure?
[0:23:17] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know.
[0:23:17] Unknown: It was like all those things that are just running total white noise that we just miss,
[0:23:23] SPEAKER_00: you know, we skip it.
[0:23:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's so loaded and then it's so unsatiating.
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_01: Like you get it all in and it means nothing afterwards.
[0:23:32] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and you never are satiated by food, by work, by friendships, by sex, by whatever.
[0:23:42] SPEAKER_00: Like you're not ever allowing yourself to like take it in.
[0:23:48] SPEAKER_00: You're just toggling all this managing all the stories completely below the level of
[0:23:53] SPEAKER_00: conscious awareness.
[0:23:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, what I like about the story that you just told is I'm not sure exactly what my
[0:24:00] SPEAKER_01: story would be on why I was such a glutton, but I know it's not that.
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_00: I know it's not that one.
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_00: It's so nuanced and individual, right?
[0:24:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_01: So you know, you just can't have a broad stroke with all of this kind of stuff.
[0:24:14] SPEAKER_01: That's why it's like I don't like rules, generally speaking.
[0:24:20] SPEAKER_01: Soon as it's like don't eat this and don't do that and don't, you know, okay, whatever you do,
[0:24:25] SPEAKER_01: you know, you've done this once.
[0:24:27] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[0:24:27] SPEAKER_01: Let's say, for example, let's say you fell in love and you always fall in love so fast,
[0:24:32] SPEAKER_01: Brooke, you know, within three weeks you're in love and you've done it every time and
[0:24:36] SPEAKER_01: it's never quite gone right.
[0:24:38] SPEAKER_01: So now you're single again and then you're like, I'm not going to fall in love within
[0:24:42] SPEAKER_01: three weeks because that's never gone right.
[0:24:45] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, that's not really what I would advise.
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:24:48] Unknown: What I would advise is to be human and present and responsive to your environment.
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_01: And that's what freedom is.
[0:24:56] SPEAKER_01: Freedom isn't following some kind of mandate that you construct from your ego consciousness
[0:25:04] SPEAKER_01: about, okay, now this will keep me safe or this will bring me more pleasure or this is the path.
[0:25:10] SPEAKER_01: It's really about being clear enough and present enough to discern for yourself,
[0:25:18] SPEAKER_01: literally moment by moment where you're at.
[0:25:21] SPEAKER_01: So when we start to talk about these stories, these stories around pleasure and these stories
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_01: around what you get and all of these kinds of things, the big problem is that they create
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_01: this idea that there's some specific way to move, you know, like, okay, so then the answer
[0:25:38] SPEAKER_01: for Brooke is, you know, she should have chocolate every day so she never feels like the window of
[0:25:44] SPEAKER_01: pleasure is so small.
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_00: We could just as easily go that route.
[0:25:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:25:47] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:25:48] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:25:48] SPEAKER_01: Pile in the pleasure.
[0:25:49] SPEAKER_01: A coach may do, you know, that's what a good old fashioned life coach could do.
[0:25:53] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, well, that's not necessarily solving anything.
[0:25:58] SPEAKER_01: And it's not letting her go like today, do I want this?
[0:26:02] SPEAKER_01: Maybe tomorrow I don't.
[0:26:04] SPEAKER_01: And where's this movement coming from?
[0:26:06] SPEAKER_01: Because our intentionality is so much the point of everything.
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_01: I mean, everything like love is always a beautiful thing.
[0:26:14] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_01: But if I treat someone with so much love and affection to get them to love me,
[0:26:20] SPEAKER_01: I'm in a corrupted pattern.
[0:26:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:26:22] SPEAKER_00: And corrupted patterns always breed corruptness.
[0:26:25] SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to start talking about the government.
[0:26:27] Unknown: Yes.
[0:26:28] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to do it.
[0:26:30] SPEAKER_01: We are not talking about that level of corruption.
[0:26:33] Unknown: Just when we do good things.
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, now I'm remembering as we're talking, we spoke a while back.
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_01: I don't remember what the episode was.
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_01: It was something about suppressing bliss.
[0:26:45] SPEAKER_01: But, you know, we were talking about this Italian psychologist, his name was Assa Joly,
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_01: who talked about the suppression of the sublime and how people can do that.
[0:26:55] Unknown: And I remember one of my mentors, my psychology mentors, her name was Stella Reznik.
[0:27:02] SPEAKER_01: She was the best.
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_01: She was in her 60s.
[0:27:04] SPEAKER_01: She was a sex therapist.
[0:27:06] SPEAKER_01: And she had studied Gestalt psychology with Fritz Perls, who I don't know if you know,
[0:27:11] SPEAKER_01: but he's the founder and he was the bomb.
[0:27:14] SPEAKER_01: And Stella was like so sexy and pleasure filled.
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, wonderful to be around.
[0:27:23] SPEAKER_01: And she was a psychoanalyst too.
[0:27:25] SPEAKER_01: And she used to talk about how, you know, people would go to therapy.
[0:27:29] SPEAKER_01: And if all you ever do is talk about your problems, then all you ever learn how to get good at is
[0:27:34] SPEAKER_01: looking at problems.
[0:27:36] SPEAKER_01: And that's very different than learning how to like feel pleasure and happiness and joy
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_01: and contentment in life.
[0:27:45] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, she would balk at how the psychological industry sort of focused on one aspect,
[0:27:51] SPEAKER_01: which, you know, is a very important aspect.
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_01: And thank God we did.
[0:27:54] SPEAKER_01: You and I have had a ton of healing that way.
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_01: I still, of course, value it.
[0:27:59] Unknown: But that there was this big thing missing, like, like, could you talk about your pleasure
[0:28:06] SPEAKER_01: with someone?
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_01: That's very intimate.
[0:28:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:28:09] Unknown: All right.
[0:28:11] SPEAKER_00: Even remember, like, when we would listen to Dharma Ocean recordings of meditations
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_00: and they're recorded live at retreats.
[0:28:19] SPEAKER_00: You know what I'm going to say.
[0:28:20] SPEAKER_00: And you would always, you would be going through the meditation and then you'd hear in the
[0:28:25] SPEAKER_00: room somebody start to break down in tears.
[0:28:28] SPEAKER_00: No, don't even go there.
[0:28:31] SPEAKER_00: Okay, no private jokes on air.
[0:28:34] Unknown: No, we will talk about it.
[0:28:36] SPEAKER_00: Okay, we will sometime.
[0:28:38] SPEAKER_00: But, you know, you'd hear somebody start to break down in tears, like they're meditating
[0:28:42] SPEAKER_00: and they have some kind of breakthrough that moves them to tears, like sobbing, kind of
[0:28:46] SPEAKER_00: sad tears, you know, like wailing kind of tears, not just rolling down the cheeks, gladness
[0:28:52] SPEAKER_00: tears.
[0:28:52] SPEAKER_00: And I remember listening and like what I would discover and what I still discover in retreat
[0:28:58] SPEAKER_00: is like I come up against all the dark emotions for sure.
[0:29:02] SPEAKER_00: But a lot of times what I access when I have my like, when a big veil is lifted,
[0:29:07] SPEAKER_00: it's hilarious.
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's just fucking so funny.
[0:29:11] SPEAKER_00: It is so funny that I had been operating under some assumption, which that soap bubble just
[0:29:17] SPEAKER_00: popped and it just seems ridiculous to me that I ever thought it was true.
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, God, you know, I remember listening to all those recordings and being
[0:29:25] SPEAKER_00: like, it is so okay and valued that somebody would burst into like sobbing, upset, wailing
[0:29:33] SPEAKER_00: tears in the middle of a meditation retreat.
[0:29:35] SPEAKER_00: But I bet if I was on my cushion and I burst out laughing, I mean, it's Dharma ocean,
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_00: like people would hold space for that.
[0:29:40] SPEAKER_00: But I bet there would be more of a like in the room, I'm saying people like, um, yeah,
[0:29:47] SPEAKER_00: like it's a little more assumed you're going to go the route of like, oh my God, you know,
[0:29:52] SPEAKER_00: big feeling, which is fine.
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_00: But we really have this bias and I do see it in spiritual circles a lot too, where we
[0:30:01] SPEAKER_00: assume we're going to go into the darkness all the time.
[0:30:05] SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah, remember when we were at the Dharma ocean retreat and I was meditating, it was the
[0:30:12] SPEAKER_01: pure awareness exercise where the guy fainted that one.
[0:30:15] SPEAKER_00: Oh God.
[0:30:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that was terrifying.
[0:30:18] SPEAKER_01: And, um, and like two minutes before the guy fainted, I had an image of Chagyam Trungpa
[0:30:24] SPEAKER_01: throwing the ball at my head saying, surprise, bitch.
[0:30:31] SPEAKER_00: Surprise, bitch.
[0:30:33] SPEAKER_00: And then down goes one of our retreat mates.
[0:30:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:30:37] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, my, um, a lot of my meditations do have humor, actually.
[0:30:43] SPEAKER_01: I mean, when, when I see Chagyam Trungpa, it's always funny.
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, totally.
[0:30:47] Unknown: At the same time, you know, I have cried deeply, I've had deep visuals.
[0:30:52] SPEAKER_01: It's really that it's life, right?
[0:30:54] SPEAKER_01: It's exquisitely unexpected.
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_01: That's what's lovely.
[0:30:57] SPEAKER_01: And you're right.
[0:30:58] SPEAKER_01: People would definitely look askew, especially all the bolder Coloradians out there.
[0:31:05] SPEAKER_00: We love you and also, you know what we're talking about.
[0:31:09] SPEAKER_01: How serious Naropa's processing levels can be.
[0:31:13] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, if you were to laugh during a meditation, I mean, you know that they'd
[0:31:18] Unknown: be like, what is happening?
[0:31:20] SPEAKER_01: You maniac.
[0:31:21] SPEAKER_01: And, and though that's the other thing.
[0:31:24] SPEAKER_01: So I'm going to share that story.
[0:31:26] SPEAKER_01: I mean, when you're sitting there and we were doing some of the meditations, it was
[0:31:29] SPEAKER_01: downright orgasmic for people.
[0:31:33] Unknown: And some people were breaking through with, and that was embarrassing for me, Brooke.
[0:31:39] SPEAKER_01: I didn't want to make that sound out loud.
[0:31:41] SPEAKER_01: I do think that there is still, as I said before, a lot of intimacy involved in pleasure.
[0:31:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:31:48] Unknown: And maybe, maybe it's part of why the tantric practitioners would work with it because it's
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_01: such an opening.
[0:31:59] SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you genuinely were to surrender and pleasure, not like stuff a chocolate cake
[0:32:05] SPEAKER_01: in your face, cause you feel like you're never going to get it again.
[0:32:08] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, cause that's not pleasure.
[0:32:09] SPEAKER_00: That's black hole.
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[0:32:11] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[0:32:11] SPEAKER_01: That's grabby hands.
[0:32:13] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:32:14] SPEAKER_01: To use common parlance.
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:32:18] SPEAKER_01: That's grabby hands.
[0:32:20] Unknown: Instead, if you were to really immerse like cellularly in pleasure, it would open you up.
[0:32:29] Unknown: I mean, you lose contact with your own boundary, right?
[0:32:35] SPEAKER_01: All of a sudden oneness becomes a real possibility.
[0:32:39] SPEAKER_01: It becomes a lived experience.
[0:32:41] SPEAKER_01: It's, it's like how, you know, they always say that the French call orgasm le petit mort,
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_01: like the little death.
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_01: And why it's because like there's this, this moment of complete surrender where your ego
[0:32:55] SPEAKER_01: can let go.
[0:32:57] SPEAKER_01: There's very few moments where your control tower, it lets go.
[0:33:01] SPEAKER_01: And I think, you know, what the, with the tantric practitioners were doing,
[0:33:06] SPEAKER_01: because they did historically work with sex.
[0:33:09] SPEAKER_01: They don't do that so much now.
[0:33:10] SPEAKER_01: And I hate that our lineage of tantra has an association with just like how to have good sex.
[0:33:17] SPEAKER_01: For 12 hours or whatever.
[0:33:19] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[0:33:20] SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's good.
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_01: I am not upset about that, but that was never what it was about.
[0:33:26] SPEAKER_01: But they did, they did use sexuality as part of it.
[0:33:29] SPEAKER_01: And it's because they were working on their energy channels, actually, like opening certain
[0:33:34] SPEAKER_01: blockages and because there was this cosmic surrender where people could feel at one,
[0:33:42] SPEAKER_01: really.
[0:33:42] SPEAKER_01: It's that loosening.
[0:33:44] Unknown: So real pleasure, real bliss, real ecstasy.
[0:33:49] SPEAKER_01: We talked about ecstasy in the past being, it's like, it comes from the Greek root,
[0:33:54] SPEAKER_01: ecstasis.
[0:33:54] SPEAKER_01: It means like standing outside of oneself.
[0:33:58] SPEAKER_01: All of these states, when you experience them, they are a surrender.
[0:34:02] SPEAKER_01: They are a complete opening.
[0:34:05] Unknown: It's like uncontrived and you don't even know what you're going to say anymore.
[0:34:10] SPEAKER_01: You have to just kind of trust something as it's unfolding if you let go like that.
[0:34:16] SPEAKER_01: And that's a place that most people don't feel safe entering.
[0:34:20] SPEAKER_01: So right now, no wonder we're taking the cheap thrills.
[0:34:25] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, of course.
[0:34:26] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, good sex requires total surrender.
[0:34:29] SPEAKER_00: That's why it's such a good teacher.
[0:34:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, not always so easy.
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_00: No, no, totally not.
[0:34:36] SPEAKER_00: In the way that all of these things are, at least, unfamiliar turf, our learning edge
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_00: for most of us.
[0:34:45] SPEAKER_00: So what I like about this, because we've talked about pleasure.
[0:34:50] SPEAKER_00: The title of our show starts with bliss.
[0:34:55] Unknown: But going back to our recent episodes on grief and despair and on chasing happiness,
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_00: the advice, I'm using air quotes, but the
[0:35:05] SPEAKER_00: input would be the same, which is to go down and in.
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_00: For me, if I'm experiencing a big unpleasant emotion, like a big heartache or something,
[0:35:16] SPEAKER_00: or a big concern, like I came home from a school conference the other day and I was
[0:35:21] SPEAKER_00: having a heartache over the way one of my son's classmates is treating my son.
[0:35:24] SPEAKER_00: Try not to talk about him too much, but I was having a whole heartache over that.
[0:35:28] SPEAKER_00: And it's the same.
[0:35:30] SPEAKER_00: You know, I meditate, I've spent a lot of time being able to feel my body from the inside.
[0:35:39] SPEAKER_00: So at least, you know, I've done that work where that's a familiar route to go.
[0:35:45] SPEAKER_00: And I just feel it.
[0:35:46] SPEAKER_00: I just feel the heartache.
[0:35:48] SPEAKER_00: I just feel what it's like in my system.
[0:35:50] SPEAKER_00: And then for pleasure and bliss and navigating in the direction of ease, it's the same thing.
[0:35:58] SPEAKER_00: It's go down and in and feel in my system.
[0:36:01] Unknown: And like if I'm having a big bliss feeling, it's the same.
[0:36:06] SPEAKER_00: It's like I have to make space for it.
[0:36:10] SPEAKER_00: Like a literal unbinding, like fascial unbinding makes space and create the opportunity for
[0:36:20] SPEAKER_00: my awareness to interact with it and to go over and say hello.
[0:36:25] SPEAKER_00: You know, so it's same, same.
[0:36:27] SPEAKER_00: It's not that we're talking about two different things.
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_00: Hello.
[0:36:32] SPEAKER_00: Hello.
[0:36:33] SPEAKER_00: I always tell this story to my rolfing clients.
[0:36:35] SPEAKER_00: I had this great Brazilian rolfing teacher who would talk to the tissue while she worked on people
[0:36:40] SPEAKER_00: and only she could get away with it because she was like wearing these charming long skirts.
[0:36:44] SPEAKER_00: And she had this Brazilian accent.
[0:36:46] SPEAKER_00: Hello, tissue.
[0:36:47] SPEAKER_00: It's okay.
[0:36:49] SPEAKER_00: I'll be right here.
[0:36:50] SPEAKER_00: I'll wait for you.
[0:36:51] SPEAKER_00: I was like, I could not pull that off, but you were totally pulling it off.
[0:36:56] SPEAKER_00: You sound so cute when you imitate her.
[0:36:58] SPEAKER_00: I like it a lot.
[0:37:05] SPEAKER_01: Do you ever read that book, The Buddhist Brain?
[0:37:08] SPEAKER_01: No.
[0:37:08] SPEAKER_01: Rick Hansen.
[0:37:10] Unknown: I mean, it's just the neuroscience aspect of how you could start to work with some of
[0:37:16] SPEAKER_01: these Buddhist practices and Buddhist ideologies.
[0:37:20] SPEAKER_01: One of the things he was talking about is drinking in the good.
[0:37:23] SPEAKER_01: And this comes up in other aspects of psychology.
[0:37:27] SPEAKER_01: There's a whole tradition called savoring.
[0:37:29] SPEAKER_01: But basically, apparently, we're quite poor at allowing the goodness to penetrate on a
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_01: deep level.
[0:37:39] SPEAKER_01: Letting it in neurobiologically, letting it into the cells, letting it into the tissues.
[0:37:44] SPEAKER_01: And there's a lot of recommendation about how you have to really slow down and savor
[0:37:49] SPEAKER_01: to let it penetrate.
[0:37:50] Unknown: And one of the simplest ways I see this is see how you respond when someone gives you
[0:37:56] SPEAKER_01: a compliment.
[0:37:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's a good one.
[0:37:59] SPEAKER_01: It's so simple.
[0:38:00] SPEAKER_01: It's such a clear identifier.
[0:38:02] SPEAKER_01: How fast do you try to let that roll off?
[0:38:05] SPEAKER_01: Oh, but it's not.
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_01: Or, oh, it's not me.
[0:38:07] SPEAKER_01: Oh, thank you.
[0:38:09] SPEAKER_01: And you'll see that you rarely let those words and the goodness that those words can really
[0:38:14] SPEAKER_01: invite because if it's a genuine compliment, it's coming with a loving energy.
[0:38:21] SPEAKER_01: How quickly you can let those roll away instead of receiving and drinking in the good.
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_01: And many people, I get the sense that many people who are listening to the show in some
[0:38:33] SPEAKER_01: way, shape or form are out there in the world trying to contribute, trying to do good, trying
[0:38:37] SPEAKER_01: to lend a helping hand to someone.
[0:38:40] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of times people who do that are often really poor at receiving.
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_01: And part of being poor at receiving is drinking in good.
[0:38:51] SPEAKER_01: Another thing could be intimacy issues, but it's just like letting that penetrate.
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_01: And so I think it's a good place to start to practice if any of you feel pleasure deficient.
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_01: It's like even as you take that bite of something sumptuous, you know, coconut,
[0:39:09] SPEAKER_01: chia seed pudding or chocolate cake, you know, or your coffee in the morning.
[0:39:14] SPEAKER_01: And it's like really going very slow and mindfully and like letting it penetrate your taste buds and
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_01: then warm your body and then feeling it in your belly and like what does it invite in your body?
[0:39:26] SPEAKER_01: And like, does it actually feel good?
[0:39:28] SPEAKER_01: Does it feel like ease or does your body actually not want it when you slow down?
[0:39:32] SPEAKER_01: Like, so that's a practice you can begin to work with pleasure.
[0:39:36] SPEAKER_01: You can do the same when someone gives you a compliment.
[0:39:39] SPEAKER_01: You know, just can I take a breath and like let that energy in?
[0:39:44] Unknown: So I think it's a good practice because, you know, we spoke about this in an earlier episode,
[0:39:52] Unknown: but many of us feel taboo around receiving goodness and contacting it in a deep way.
[0:40:01] SPEAKER_01: And I think the other piece, Brooke, I don't I wonder if you're experiencing this now,
[0:40:06] SPEAKER_01: because you and I can also get prone to mania.
[0:40:08] Unknown: And I sort of associate this with my own kind of tendency is that sometimes,
[0:40:16] SPEAKER_01: sometimes pleasure strikes me so strongly.
[0:40:19] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm on a walk and the air is just right and the trees are so beautiful.
[0:40:26] SPEAKER_01: You know, like those are my walking companions.
[0:40:28] SPEAKER_01: I do talk to trees.
[0:40:30] SPEAKER_01: Hashtag.
[0:40:31] SPEAKER_00: Hashtag talk to the trees.
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_01: Talk to trees.
[0:40:34] SPEAKER_01: Crazy lady that walks around the neighborhood touching them and hoping no one sees.
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_00: You have to do it in a Brazilian accent next time.
[0:40:40] SPEAKER_00: Hello trees.
[0:40:41] SPEAKER_00: Hello trees.
[0:40:42] SPEAKER_01: You're so beautiful.
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_00: I see you.
[0:40:45] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I will.
[0:40:46] SPEAKER_01: They'll love it.
[0:40:48] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I'm walking around and, you know, like, like the pleasure is the openness is just
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_01: kind of like mounting in my system.
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_01: And I swear all of a sudden, I just want to fall on my knees.
[0:41:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:41:03] SPEAKER_01: From the beauty of it all.
[0:41:04] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:41:05] Unknown: Like weep and literally get on my knees.
[0:41:08] SPEAKER_01: And then I, and then I hold myself back because it's not socially appropriate.
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:41:15] SPEAKER_01: So pleasure is this thing, right?
[0:41:18] Unknown: If you were to fully open to the bliss that is this world, you know, the bliss that's in your body.
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_01: As you unwind some of these kinks in the hose, you know, as you were describing Brooke, like
[0:41:31] SPEAKER_01: I do find you feel ecstasy at some of the more simple things.
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_01: It's so available.
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_01: And if you were to allow that all of the time, I guess for me, my worry is I'll be a fucking crazy
[0:41:43] SPEAKER_01: lady, that crazy lady who's like at the foot of a tree weeping.
[0:41:47] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:41:47] SPEAKER_00: Because it's so beautiful.
[0:41:48] SPEAKER_00: And some of the time you will, you know, but I'll speak for myself.
[0:41:51] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm trying to figure out how to embody these things.
[0:41:57] SPEAKER_00: Like how do I have enough space for this relatively new thing?
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_00: Like I can have as much pleasure I want and it's available all the time.
[0:42:06] Unknown: What?
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_00: Uh, uh, what?
[0:42:09] Unknown: You know?
[0:42:10] SPEAKER_00: And so there are these moments where you unkink a portion of the hose and it does, it just
[0:42:14] SPEAKER_00: fresh water rushes through and it's that like fall on the ground, tears rolling down your cheeks.
[0:42:21] SPEAKER_00: Like that really happens guys.
[0:42:23] SPEAKER_00: It's not just some crazy story you've read in spiritual books somewhere.
[0:42:28] Unknown: It happens genuinely sometimes, but I think as it becomes more embodied, you know, more familiar,
[0:42:35] SPEAKER_00: you have more space for it.
[0:42:36] SPEAKER_00: You have fewer kinks in the hose that, um, I would imagine, I don't know yet, but I would
[0:42:42] SPEAKER_00: imagine there's less of the becoming the person who's just weeping at the base of a tree for 10
[0:42:46] SPEAKER_00: years.
[0:42:46] SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't know.
[0:42:48] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:42:48] SPEAKER_00: We'll see.
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you.
[0:42:50] SPEAKER_01: You know, the image I got when you were just talking about like the flooding coming as you
[0:42:54] SPEAKER_01: unkink the hose was like, I ever have that experience where you're ridiculously thirsty
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_01: or something.
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_01: And then when you first have water, it almost hurts a little.
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:43:04] SPEAKER_00: And you just still feel ridiculously thirsty.
[0:43:06] SPEAKER_00: Like you just can't get enough.
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_01: And it's like it cracks in your throat and it's like, if for some reason our system's been
[0:43:15] SPEAKER_01: deprived of this deep, simple state of goodness, um, basic goodness, as Jagiam Trungpa would call
[0:43:22] SPEAKER_01: it, then, then I imagine as it's coming in, it's like, it's a little grisly, it's a little painful.
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_01: We're so thirsty, you know?
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_01: And so we have to, strangely enough, you know, be really kind with ourselves around, um,
[0:43:37] SPEAKER_01: learning to receive and open to all of this goodness.
[0:43:41] SPEAKER_01: And also, um, I think it's why Kieran uses the word ease a lot, right?
[0:43:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:43:47] SPEAKER_01: Like have you heard her use the word pleasure a lot?
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_01: Does she talk about that in the delicious body?
[0:43:52] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to think if pleasure is the actual word, because certainly delicious is her word.
[0:43:58] Unknown: Delicious is also her nickname, which is totally appropriate.
[0:44:05] SPEAKER_00: Um, and being with her, I just have to say this, my friend Christina coined this.
[0:44:10] SPEAKER_00: Did you ever see that Woody Allen movie where, um, I don't know, they're like on another planet
[0:44:14] SPEAKER_00: or whatever and the way they have sex is they hold onto this sex ball, the orgasmatron or something.
[0:44:18] SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.
[0:44:19] SPEAKER_00: Do you see that?
[0:44:19] SPEAKER_00: And they just hold onto it and they're like, uh, they don't want to let go.
[0:44:22] SPEAKER_00: He doesn't want to let go Woody Allen of the orgasmatron ball.
[0:44:25] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:44:26] SPEAKER_00: Kieran, hugging Kieran's a little bit like that.
[0:44:30] SPEAKER_00: It's like sex ball, the orgasmatron.
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_00: So she's somebody who really inhabits delicious.
[0:44:39] Unknown: And you know, one of the helpful meditations is just to be in the presence of people who can,
[0:44:47] SPEAKER_00: you know, it's helpful.
[0:44:49] Unknown: Like our systems do resonate like playing music with somebody, you know, it's helpful.
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_01: Well, and it'll feel safer because, you know, if everybody's doing it,
[0:45:01] SPEAKER_01: there's this, um, welcome invitation to step into it.
[0:45:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:45:05] SPEAKER_01: You don't have to live in that other part that you formally assumed for safety.
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_01: Or even, sorry, go ahead.
[0:45:12] SPEAKER_01: No, no, it's not that important.
[0:45:14] SPEAKER_01: I was just saying, I think that the word pleasure did get a little corrupted in our culture.
[0:45:19] SPEAKER_00: It did.
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_01: Cause it's usually attached to addictions and yeah, and gluttony and addictions and,
[0:45:26] SPEAKER_01: and fleeting states, like, you know, how they talk about, um,
[0:45:30] SPEAKER_01: like hedonism and then they talk about eudaimonia and there's like,
[0:45:33] SPEAKER_01: you know, the happiness one could get from meaning versus the happiness one could get from
[0:45:38] SPEAKER_01: really these material objects and pleasures really, if you were to like,
[0:45:42] SPEAKER_01: if we were to study positive psychology, they would say pleasure is like the lowest form.
[0:45:48] SPEAKER_01: It's like the, you know, cause pleasure implies that temporality.
[0:45:51] SPEAKER_01: Like it really is like, oh, I'm getting a massage and it feels good or I'm having cake and yum and,
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_01: or sex, but that these are all kind of, um, fleeting things.
[0:46:02] SPEAKER_01: And so I think culturally that's been the energy of the word itself.
[0:46:10] SPEAKER_01: So maybe just as we're, you know, coming to the end, talking about like, what do you really mean
[0:46:15] SPEAKER_01: by pleasure when you're saying pleasure?
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean more that fundamental nourishing goodness, not a fleeting, not a thing out there,
[0:46:28] Unknown: the cake, but more the ability to open your system and like feel really good,
[0:46:37] Unknown: like foundational fundamental good and taking pleasure in what is actually happening.
[0:46:47] SPEAKER_00: So not only the things we label as pleasurable, you know, like sex, but like whatever is happening
[0:46:55] SPEAKER_00: in the moment, the way the light's coming through the window, you know, so that kind of basic
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_00: frame of seeing the world as, as good, you know, that there's goodness here and available all the
[0:47:06] Unknown: time and that we can be receptive to it. We can fill up on it.
[0:47:12] Unknown: You know, that like Buddhist idea that we were born pure and I, I always loved that idea so much
[0:47:20] Unknown: because it was medicine for me. I think I had immersed myself in the Judeo-Christian kind of
[0:47:26] Unknown: idea, or at least Christian idea, that we were born sin, with sin. And this idea that we were
[0:47:34] SPEAKER_01: born pure, Chogayam Trungpa takes that and he talks about it as just basic goodness,
[0:47:40] Unknown: that everybody has a basic goodness. It's like, it's like this very simple goodness of trees.
[0:47:46] SPEAKER_01: It's nothing complicated. It's like, he'd even be like a burrito has basic goodness,
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_01: like there's just basic goodness. And I think the trance of unworthiness and the ideas that
[0:47:58] SPEAKER_01: we're not basically good and that life's not basically implicitly good, you know, are some of
[0:48:04] SPEAKER_01: the stumbling blocks to us just immersing in the kind of pleasure that you're talking about, this
[0:48:10] SPEAKER_01: sort of fundamental deliciousness. And I know that's why Kieran uses that word is because it's
[0:48:15] SPEAKER_01: visceral, it's embodied, you know, that kind of fundamental ease and yes-ness. It's like,
[0:48:22] SPEAKER_01: the only reason why we're not feeling that on a regular basis, if you're not feeling that on a
[0:48:27] Unknown: regular basis, is because we don't yet see that we are loved, we are good, we are implicitly right.
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_01: That world is a place that has loving energy and implicit goodness swirling into everything.
[0:48:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's very easy to look around the world and see the grit. I think most people spend their
[0:48:49] Unknown: time trying not to. But somehow we don't always seem to contact that basic goodness.
[0:49:00] SPEAKER_00: So I might start a tradition here of ending every episode with a new t-shirt idea. And this one is,
[0:49:07] Unknown: even burritos have basic goodness. That's our next in the t-shirt line.
[0:49:14] SPEAKER_01: You're like an enigma wrapped in a burrito shell, Brooke.
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_01: But with basic goodness.
[0:49:25] SPEAKER_01: But definitely full of basic goodness. Thanks for crying out loud.

[0:50:46] SPEAKER_00: of embodied spirituality. Brooke and Vanessa are so honest, it's a gift to listen to them describe
[0:50:50] SPEAKER_00: their real life processes and practices for living a more present, fully human life. If you enjoy
[0:50:57] SPEAKER_00: listening to real people who are funny, down to earth, and extremely generous in their vulnerability,
[0:51:02] SPEAKER_00: listen up. What a treat. Thank you so much for that Juliana, and thanks to all of you for listening.
