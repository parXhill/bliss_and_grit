[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Skado and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_01: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On this show, we're talking about
[0:00:17] SPEAKER_01: being on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is a real
[0:00:23] SPEAKER_01: evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy,
[0:00:30] SPEAKER_01: the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. We'll be attempting
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_01: to sort that out for ourselves here on the show and we're so glad you're listening in.
[0:00:42] SPEAKER_01: In today's episode, we're talking about teachers, sanghas and gurus behaving badly. Classically
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_01: in many spiritual traditions, you begin your journey by following a specific teacher. But
[0:00:55] SPEAKER_01: Does that apply to modern times? In response to many of your questions about how to find
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_01: a path and or a teacher, we're discussing how we got started on our way, whether people
[0:01:08] SPEAKER_01: need to commit to a teacher or a path, how we personally found our mentors, and of course,
[0:01:14] SPEAKER_01: some of the pitfalls you should look out for along the way. If you're enjoying the show,
[0:01:20] SPEAKER_01: we'd be totally delighted if you left a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is
[0:01:26] SPEAKER_01: bliss and grit. You can also head over to bliss and grit.com now and subscribe to hear
[0:01:32] SPEAKER_01: updates on any upcoming events we might have coming up, which I swear sooner rather than
[0:01:38] Unknown: later they're coming your way. One last note before we head into the conversation. If you're
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_01: new to the podcast, Brooke and I have potty mouths. So if there are kids around, you may
[0:01:49] SPEAKER_01: want to pop in some headphones. Okay, everyone, here we go.
[0:01:56] SPEAKER_00: Hey, Vanessa.
[0:01:58] SPEAKER_01: Hi, darling.
[0:02:00] SPEAKER_00: We have been getting a variety of different questions, social media, by email, and comments
[0:02:09] SPEAKER_00: here and there that are all pointing to a similar thing. So I'm going to try and summarize them
[0:02:13] Unknown: all pointing to a similar question, which is basically like, how do I pick? Meaning how do I
[0:02:22] Unknown: pick a teacher, a tradition, spiritual community, aka a sangha? How do I know? So that's kind of
[0:02:34] SPEAKER_00: like a how do I start? And how do I know that I'm on path that's right for me? And all of those
[0:02:41] SPEAKER_00: questions also I've noticed are coming with this under layer of fear might be a strong word, but
[0:02:49] Unknown: fear, worry, concern about picking wrong. So not being on the right path for them. Not feeling safe
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_00: about being able to trust a teacher, which of course gets us into all kinds of guru things.
[0:03:07] Unknown: And basically, like, how once they're on a path, how can they be sure that they're still connected
[0:03:17] Unknown: to their own agency in the world that keeps them safe and pointed, you know, in their own true north
[0:03:26] SPEAKER_00: direction. So when I first started getting the questions, I was kind of like, Oh, okay, you know,
[0:03:31] SPEAKER_00: it's this straightforward question about how do I get started on the path? And then as I started
[0:03:39] SPEAKER_00: thinking about it, I was like, Oh, boy, like, this actually brings up whole bunches of stuff, you
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_00: know, and concerns that are really real and valid. And we've certainly seen plenty of examples of
[0:03:52] SPEAKER_00: gurus behaving badly, or people having confusion around that in a way where they maybe get
[0:03:58] Unknown: themselves into a not great situation. So yeah, there's a lot to say from the like very basic,
[0:04:08] Unknown: how do I start to once I'm really engaged in a path? What do I need? What does that look like? And
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_00: how can I be sure I'm making the right choice?
[0:04:19] Unknown: Hmm. Yeah, okay. Let's see what comes out of our mouths. I know who knows, right? There's a lot
[0:04:30] SPEAKER_01: that could be said. I think I'm going to put in a little cautionary warning. I'm a little manic
[0:04:35] Unknown: today, probably because I barely talked to people these last few days. So let it on out. Maybe you'll
[0:04:43] SPEAKER_01: have a lot to say people. I was talking to a client of mine the other day. And she had found
[0:04:51] Unknown: this sweet Buddhist center. And, you know, for weeks, she was really explaining like the teacher
[0:04:59] SPEAKER_01: and the things he would say and how they would affect her. And then she didn't speak a lot about
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_01: the song or the community. But clearly, she found it like a really nice nourishing place to go. And
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_01: she was really feeling anchored. And I've known this client for a while, she's had other spiritual
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_01: teachers, she'd go on retreats. But this is the first time it was like in her city. Like she could
[0:05:19] Unknown: show up once or twice a week. And she was really enjoying it. And I spoke to her a couple weeks ago,
[0:05:26] Unknown: and she was like, Oh, you know, you'll never guess what happened with my with my Buddhist center. And
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_01: she had done a bunch of research prior because she's someone who goes in with that level of
[0:05:39] Unknown: skepticism that you had described. It's kind of like, like her antennas are already up,
[0:05:45] SPEAKER_01: and she's being prepared to have like some culty or guru II scenario happen because of some things
[0:05:52] Unknown: that happened in her past with religion. And she didn't find anything. But this night, for some
[0:05:59] Unknown: reason, she got this like, hit to do some more research. So she goes and she googles. And it's
[0:06:07] SPEAKER_01: she doesn't find out anything like terrible other than it's a sect of Buddhism that is at war with
[0:06:13] SPEAKER_01: the Dalai Lama. And they're doing all sorts of practices that the Dalai Lama doesn't prescribe
[0:06:19] SPEAKER_01: and doesn't recommend. And that the guru who is the leader of this aspect of Buddhist tradition,
[0:06:28] SPEAKER_01: basically only wants you reading things he wrote, etc, etc. And it started to feel that way.
[0:06:36] Unknown: Yeah, yes, or to feel that way to her. And so then it was like, the whole thing was kind of
[0:06:42] Unknown: ruined. You know, it's like it was over. And, you know, we did a little work on how could she still
[0:06:50] SPEAKER_01: take the teachings that she had felt were valuable, like not throw the baby out with the
[0:06:54] SPEAKER_01: bath water. But clearly, she she felt compelled to move on. So these things happen. Yeah, I mean,
[0:07:02] Unknown: I don't think that they've ever happened to me. I know, I was thinking about that too,
[0:07:07] SPEAKER_00: and answering this. And I was like, Okay, so speaking from my own experience, like I don't have
[0:07:13] SPEAKER_00: experiences, you know, of gurus behaving badly, I don't have experiences of feeling like I've lost
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_00: my agency to either somebody who had qualify as like an important therapeutic relationship,
[0:07:25] SPEAKER_00: like more of spiritual therapist or counseling kind of stuff. Or, you know, from a straight up
[0:07:31] Unknown: spiritual teacher, like I haven't felt at risk of being kind of whatever seduced down a weird
[0:07:42] SPEAKER_00: path. And certainly I do and I've shared, you know, in love relationships. So you would think
[0:07:49] SPEAKER_00: that that maybe would be a little something on, you know, that comes up for me, but it really hasn't.
[0:07:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. But it is in a lot of places. I actually do have a lot of good friends that have been through
[0:08:01] SPEAKER_01: this in multiple traditions. One of them was in native traditions, where she had some shamans who
[0:08:07] SPEAKER_01: were on the darker side, and she hadn't realized it. I know women who've been molested by male
[0:08:13] SPEAKER_01: teachers, you know, that has certainly come up. What's the name of that guy? Is it the Iyengar
[0:08:19] SPEAKER_01: tradition, the sweaty yoga, Bikram? Oh, gosh. Yeah. Right. I mean, if you all don't know who's
[0:08:26] SPEAKER_01: listening, Bikram has been accused of a cult and multiple levels of sexual abuse within his community.
[0:08:33] SPEAKER_01: And there's plenty of people who still adore him and think he is something wonderful. So there's
[0:08:38] Unknown: like controversy, and this is not that uncommon. I did have once somebody tell me that something
[0:08:44] SPEAKER_01: I was doing was ayahuasca and they were lying and it was a chemical and this person has quite a huge
[0:08:50] Unknown: following. Yeah. So these things do happen. I just haven't been seduced down that kind of path. So
[0:08:59] SPEAKER_01: I guess the first place we start is we acknowledge that there's some reason for the distrust that
[0:09:05] Unknown: goes beyond the typical just we're humans, therefore we have fears of intimacy. We have
[0:09:12] SPEAKER_01: fears of losing agency and control, which is a big one, and especially in the West where we like our
[0:09:18] Unknown: independence. But going beyond that, this has happened. And actually it's happened quite a bit
[0:09:25] SPEAKER_01: in spiritual communities where teachers have gone awry and there's been controversy.
[0:09:31] SPEAKER_01: We're quite frankly, Brooke, I mean, I know this is kind of a sidebar, but like when we talk about
[0:09:36] SPEAKER_01: the sangha, what I have experienced is doing things like going to yoga communities and finding out
[0:09:42] Unknown: that people are really shitty. Yeah. Yes. Or yeah, on spiritual retreat, I'm always like,
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_00: which one of these is going to make me, as you know, because I'm usually on retreat with you,
[0:09:55] SPEAKER_00: which one of these people is going to push every button I have? Yes. Yes. You find the random
[0:10:01] SPEAKER_00: narcissist on every retreat. That's because that karmic seed is like in the field. Who's the shitty
[0:10:07] SPEAKER_00: narcissist that's going to make me insane? And turn me into their mother. I don't know.
[0:10:13] Unknown: But we find them. I know. So I have experienced being a part of communities where you think
[0:10:20] SPEAKER_01: you're in this like more conscious minded, more enlightened on a relative spectrum,
[0:10:27] SPEAKER_01: kind of a community like a yoga community or, or a Buddhist sangha, and then found that people
[0:10:32] SPEAKER_01: treated each other really shitty. Yeah. Or were gossiping or were as narcissistic as it got.
[0:10:38] SPEAKER_01: So, so I have experienced that. So I don't know, do you want to start to go down the like cautionary
[0:10:44] SPEAKER_01: tale of like how to confront fear when you're looking at a path slash teacher or just, you know,
[0:10:50] SPEAKER_01: where do you begin when you're spiritually curious and you're seeking, because that's what
[0:10:55] SPEAKER_01: a lot of people are going through. They're listening to us and they're resonating with it.
[0:10:59] Unknown: And they're like, okay, great. But how do I find my mentor or my path that I'm fascinated by?
[0:11:07] SPEAKER_00: Right. When we were talking before we started recording, you said it's a lot like love,
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_00: you know, it's a lot like falling in love. And I think that's true. Like there's, when you're,
[0:11:18] SPEAKER_00: when you're dating, when you're looking for love, when you know it's something you want, there's
[0:11:23] SPEAKER_00: a wide spectrum of what's out there, you know, there's somebody who's going to make you crazy.
[0:11:28] SPEAKER_00: There's somebody who's really not good for you. And there are all kinds of partnerships that are
[0:11:32] SPEAKER_00: going to be like good and resonant and, and fruitful, you know, so when I was first thinking
[0:11:37] SPEAKER_00: about this question and I was thinking like, okay, what's the, what's the easy way to answer it? And
[0:11:42] SPEAKER_00: then of course I kept discovering there is no easy way. It's like actually a really complex question.
[0:11:47] SPEAKER_00: But the first thing I came to is like, we should always keep returning to, is this working for me?
[0:11:53] SPEAKER_00: Now that's a completely tricky thing because at first I was like, oh yeah,
[0:11:56] SPEAKER_00: it's either working or it's not like there should be results in your life. Your life should be
[0:12:01] SPEAKER_00: cleaning up and growing up, you know, and, and flourishing. However, the process of cleaning up
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_00: and growing up is coming face to face with all of your shit. So it's like we do on these paths
[0:12:17] SPEAKER_00: come into very intimate contact with the most challenging aspects of ourselves,
[0:12:23] SPEAKER_00: the aspects of ourselves that we really don't want to see and that are going to get illuminated at
[0:12:26] SPEAKER_00: some point. And so there are going to be moments where your teacher pisses you off, some idea that
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_00: is held in your community that forces you to reconcile with some part of yourself you don't
[0:12:38] Unknown: like pisses you off. You know, so it's actually not like a perfect, right? Because the question is,
[0:12:46] SPEAKER_00: what is working for you mean? Because working for you doesn't necessarily mean that you're just
[0:12:52] SPEAKER_00: skipping through daisies all the time and everything's miraculous. Because the truth is,
[0:12:57] SPEAKER_00: it's all those karmic seeds get pushed up through the soil and now you have to attend.
[0:13:02] SPEAKER_00: Um, but there is this quality, you know, just like in love relationship, working for you
[0:13:11] SPEAKER_00: doesn't necessarily mean that you never have a disagreeable moment with your partner, or that
[0:13:18] SPEAKER_00: there, there isn't a single thing about them that you, you dislike or, you know, that annoys you,
[0:13:24] SPEAKER_00: like the way they don't wash the dishes right after they cook or whatever. But what it does
[0:13:28] SPEAKER_00: mean is like that those things are held within a larger frame of this person is safe and genuine
[0:13:37] SPEAKER_00: and honest and loving and they're here for me, you know? So even though we can bicker about
[0:13:46] Unknown: the dishes, the finances, whatever, I know that I'm safe with this person. Now,
[0:13:53] Unknown: knowing that you're safe with a person like anything is a process. It isn't and shouldn't be
[0:14:01] SPEAKER_00: instantaneous, you know? And I think for sure an easy red flag of somebody who's not operating
[0:14:06] Unknown: from integrity is that they insist that you should hand yourself over to them with complete blind
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_00: trust ever, but particularly in the beginning of a relationship. And I mean with like a teacher or
[0:14:22] SPEAKER_00: sangha, you know? So in some ways it helps to just think because the spiritual world like gets all of
[0:14:29] SPEAKER_00: these weird ideas attached to it and we put it aside as something other than the rest of our
[0:14:36] SPEAKER_00: normal human lives. It's something other worldly and so the normal rules don't apply and yeah,
[0:14:42] SPEAKER_00: that's not true. Like the normal rules about being good humans applies and that doesn't mean
[0:14:50] Unknown: a stress-free experience, but it does mean like integrity and basic human decency reign supreme.
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_00: That's just a part of the container that's non-optional.
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_01: I had a friend who was doing energy work once in a Buddhist sangha and this friend was,
[0:15:13] SPEAKER_01: he's high quality, he's top-notch human being and he's a good energy worker. And you know,
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_01: he was doing it within the sangha, everyone knew, and there was a moment when he wasn't there
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_01: and the teacher, the head of the sangha of that community, came out and warned the group about him
[0:15:35] Unknown: without him present. And that to me is like a red flag.
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because it's not integrity. Again, it comes down to basic human integrity. If you have an issue
[0:15:45] SPEAKER_00: with that person, you address it with the person. If you're going to address it with the group,
[0:15:49] SPEAKER_00: they know that you're going to address it with the group.
[0:15:51] SPEAKER_01: That you're going to address it with the group. Exactly. So, you know, some of what you can
[0:15:55] SPEAKER_01: look for about what Brooke was just referencing is it's common courtesies. It's like common level
[0:16:01] SPEAKER_01: of integrity. It's not even this like spiritual airy kind of level of integrity. It's like just
[0:16:08] SPEAKER_01: very basic, like do they gossip? Do they talk badly about their students? How do they handle
[0:16:14] SPEAKER_01: conflict? How do they handle difficult students? Yeah, if someone pushes back at them,
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: do they get all kinds of inflamed and have a temper tantrum?
[0:16:23] SPEAKER_01: Right. Remember when that narcissist went up at the Dharma Ocean retreat and Tammy's just sitting
[0:16:30] SPEAKER_01: there and he just like railed into like, well, if I'm not getting results, what does this all mean?
[0:16:34] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, he kind of just went on this like egoic rant, you know, and Tammy just sat there,
[0:16:41] SPEAKER_01: like really collected and she didn't come back at him the way I would want to have like with an
[0:16:47] SPEAKER_01: intellectual smack down or some egoic, you know, kind of talk. And it's like that's,
[0:16:53] SPEAKER_00: that's because Tammy has a lot of integrity. Yeah. And she pulled the plug on where that
[0:16:57] SPEAKER_00: could have gone, you know, like, so he has a certain kind of fuel that's pulling for a certain
[0:17:02] SPEAKER_00: kind of fuel back from her. And instead of doing that, she's able to disrupt the situation by
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_00: saying like, okay, you know, but why are we even here? What are we really talking about?
[0:17:15] Unknown: Yeah, but it was loving. Yeah. And it was integrity filled. So you can watch for that. But I'm
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_01: thinking, Brooke, what about looking at it like this? Because, okay, I'm digging the falling in
[0:17:26] SPEAKER_01: love analogy. Why? Because you are not supposed to fall in love with your teacher. So don't do that.
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_01: Don't do it the way that the word usually means, although you should be quite in love with
[0:17:37] SPEAKER_01: everything in life if your heart is open. But why is because who your teacher is, is kind of like
[0:17:44] SPEAKER_01: who your lover is. Like, you don't exactly write a list and then like decide these are the
[0:17:51] SPEAKER_01: characteristics. It's more like you get hit with the thunderbolt and you're like, it's you.
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_00: Yes. And that's the way it's been with all of my like, I have three people who I consider my major
[0:18:00] SPEAKER_00: teachers, Reggie Ray, Kieran Trace, Judith Blackstone. And all of them are just like,
[0:18:05] SPEAKER_00: yes, yes, a million times. Yes. As soon as I hear their voice, it's like, yes.
[0:18:11] SPEAKER_01: Yes. It was all of them. And it was John Wellwood. And it was Chagyam Trungpa Rinpoche through books.
[0:18:17] SPEAKER_01: So I'm thinking like, okay, but if people are following with my love analogy, if people are
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_01: thinking like, what's my path? Okay, so is it Hinduism? Is it Kabbalah? Is it Buddhism? You know,
[0:18:31] SPEAKER_01: I'm curious and I want to go more in depth, but where do I even begin? You know, what's my path?
[0:18:38] SPEAKER_01: That's kind of like, do I like men? Do I like women? You know, like, where am I going to start
[0:18:45] SPEAKER_01: this kind of search? You know, like, how do I feel into that? And then once they decide, it's like,
[0:18:51] SPEAKER_01: okay, I kind of like this flavor the most. This is where I'm really finding myself drawn to.
[0:18:56] SPEAKER_01: It's like, okay, well, now, how do I find a teacher within that tradition? Or how do I find
[0:19:01] Unknown: a practices or a sangha? And then from there, it's like, okay, now that I'm drawn towards this,
[0:19:07] SPEAKER_01: how do I trust these people? And I know that this is silly and steps, but it's kind of like that,
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_01: just for conversation. So I'm thinking like, if I go back to the beginning, because I've studied
[0:19:18] SPEAKER_01: Taoism, I've studied Native American traditions, I've studied Buddhism, you know, a little bit about
[0:19:25] SPEAKER_01: yogic traditions, probably a little less than some of the other ones. And it's like, how did I
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_01: begin? Well, I began, I don't know about you, but I began by going to bookstores and walking around
[0:19:37] Unknown: their like Eastern philosophy sections, and their spiritual ones with all the tarot books and all
[0:19:44] SPEAKER_01: that kind of stuff. And tuning into what I always thought of as like my book fairy, was like my book
[0:19:50] SPEAKER_01: fairy godmother that would like help the right book come my way. And I would just pick up whatever
[0:19:58] SPEAKER_01: I was interested in, read a couple of paragraphs, and then dive into it. And I did that kind of over
[0:20:05] Unknown: and over and over again, until I started to find kind of where I was most drawn. And eventually,
[0:20:15] SPEAKER_01: I found John Wellwood through his book. And so I found my first like teacher, you know, my live
[0:20:20] SPEAKER_01: teacher. But how did you even begin to know like, Oh, I'm interested in Buddhism, like, you know what
[0:20:27] Unknown: I mean? How do you like find a beginning tradition? For myself, and for anyone else I've ever spoken to
[0:20:34] Unknown: about this, it has always been like falling in love. It's always been an experience that showed up,
[0:20:44] Unknown: you know, like you said, the fairy godmother, we are so indoctrinated to think that we make decisions
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_00: from our egoic mind from our thinking mind, and that we can kind of research the best spiritual
[0:20:58] SPEAKER_00: paths for ourselves and then pick one based on some kind of internal pro and con list, like,
[0:21:03] Unknown: well, this fits with my blah, blah, blah, and not with my. So finding the right path and the right
[0:21:09] SPEAKER_00: teacher and the right community is a spiritual practice in and of itself, you get led, it's not
[0:21:16] SPEAKER_00: you, you're not doing anything, and it's going to show up. So it could be your book fairy, or it
[0:21:22] Unknown: could just be your resource fairy, you know, Vanessa and I are people, first of all, so like,
[0:21:28] SPEAKER_00: we have a lot to say, sometimes depends on the day. But anyway, we're also talking about a lot of
[0:21:35] SPEAKER_00: teachers who we're really passionate about. So like, there's all those names sprinkled right there.
[0:21:40] SPEAKER_00: And then there are other resources, there's Sounds True, which is this whole giant resource
[0:21:44] SPEAKER_00: of spiritual teachers in the world, there's Buddha at the Gas Pump, which is a podcast talking to
[0:21:48] SPEAKER_00: people, there's On Being with Krista Tippett. So there's so many people out there doing this work,
[0:21:53] SPEAKER_00: and all you have to do is just like, what is the thing that that winks at you, you know, and it's
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_00: not subtle, just like, you know, when you have an amazing first date, you're like, I want to see that
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_00: guy again. That was awesome. Like we had great conversation, we've laughed like real laughing.
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_00: It feels like that, you know, and I remember when I first listened to you introduce me,
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_00: you pestered me for a while, actually, you were like, Brooke, would you listen to Reggie Ray,
[0:22:18] SPEAKER_00: Dharma Ocean, Dharma Ocean sounded so corny to me, the words that I was like, come on.
[0:22:22] SPEAKER_00: And so I finally listened to it one day. So it was like perfect day, perfect timing, I put it on,
[0:22:28] SPEAKER_00: I wasn't expecting anything except I was thinking of it as an intellectual exercise for my podcast,
[0:22:33] SPEAKER_00: I was like, oh, okay, for liberated body, I'll just listen to it a bit. It was, I think,
[0:22:38] SPEAKER_00: 30 seconds into listening to Reggie talk for the very first time in a recording that I was
[0:22:43] SPEAKER_00: literally weeping in my living room. And I was like this, I wasn't looking for a teacher,
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_00: I didn't give a shit about being on a spiritual path or not. But it was like, yes, this. And it's
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_00: been like that with all of the teachers who I consider my major teachers. So it is like falling
[0:22:58] SPEAKER_01: in love, you know, I'm laughing because I know how like very emotive that experience is for you
[0:23:04] SPEAKER_00: because I've witnessed it. I dedicate my whole life to this. You're like, okay, I have
[0:23:14] SPEAKER_01: what I felt like when I found John Wellwood. So, you know, we're in our 40s, right? So that was
[0:23:20] SPEAKER_01: like, we weren't even really using the internet that much when I found John Wellwood. So it's
[0:23:25] SPEAKER_01: like old school style, like I had to sit and read a book. Yeah, like, and I read his book
[0:23:30] Unknown: toward the psychology of awakening. And it was like this. Yeah. And I think that's it. Like,
[0:23:36] SPEAKER_01: you know, how we've talked about delicious. Yes. Right. Like, delicious. Yes. There are a lot of
[0:23:41] SPEAKER_01: nuances to it that I'm still working with. But one like, is it a hell yes or not is so clear,
[0:23:47] SPEAKER_01: because one person asks you to do a business project. And you're like, hmm, on my pro and
[0:23:53] SPEAKER_01: con list, this is interesting. And then another person asks, and you're like, yes,
[0:23:58] SPEAKER_00: right. Oh, totally. No, this thing. Yes. It doesn't feel like effort. It's just like wind at my back.
[0:24:04] SPEAKER_01: Yes. Just like all of, you know, perhaps a moment when you went on a date and you're coming up with
[0:24:08] SPEAKER_01: your pros, but this is a very nice person. You're trying to talk yourself into it versus you go on
[0:24:13] SPEAKER_01: a date and it's like, oh, oh, hell yes. Yeah. You find now. Yeah. And so like, well, on paper,
[0:24:19] SPEAKER_00: we both like hiking and we've both worked in the arts, you know, but you're not feeling it.
[0:24:26] SPEAKER_01: No. So you'll know when it's a yes. That's the first thing to kind of think of. I've read
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_01: toward the psychology of awakening. It was a yes. I immediately went to find when John was teaching.
[0:24:36] Unknown: And of course it was soon because that's the beauty of synchronicity because he was meant
[0:24:41] SPEAKER_01: to be my teacher. And I went, I remember Chogiam Trungpa Rinpoche has always been my, my, my teacher.
[0:24:49] SPEAKER_01: He has never been alive at the same time as me. I think he died right around when I was born.
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_01: But from books, always. I found Reggie by listening to Chogiam Trungpa Rinpoche podcasts
[0:25:01] SPEAKER_01: and searching, and I heard Reggie's voice and it same thing as Brooke. I was like him, mine, must.
[0:25:08] SPEAKER_01: Yes. Right. And I think I listened to Reggie for about a year before I was like, Brooke,
[0:25:13] SPEAKER_01: should we actually go on this retreat and like make it a thing? And then I remember you and I
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_01: in the car driving to Dharma Ocean, listening to Kieran, cause I have pulled up her Buddha at the
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_01: gas pump podcast. And I was like, okay, I was actually looking for a little validation on that
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_01: one. Cause I was like, I'm really resonating with this one. But if any of you have heard Kieran,
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: she's a little more far to the left than a typical Buddhist teacher, right? Buddhism sounds so like
[0:25:42] SPEAKER_01: intellectual. You get to feel non, I don't know, airy fairy for lack of a better way. But Kieran
[0:25:49] SPEAKER_01: was a little to the left. So I was like, I really like her and I put her on for Brooke and Brooke
[0:25:53] Unknown: was like a thousand times. Yes. Yes. And that same retreat, I had her actually before Brooke even
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_01: heard Judith Blackstone. And before I even heard of her, we heard her name and we both were like,
[0:26:07] Unknown: it's her. Yeah, I know. That's right. With Judith, it was just her name. That's so funny.
[0:26:12] SPEAKER_01: And then I listened to her on Buddha at the gas pump. So, okay, a couple of things you can extract
[0:26:17] SPEAKER_01: from this one. When you find the right inroad, it comes from something much larger than you.
[0:26:24] SPEAKER_01: And it feels like a slam in the back, like, hell yes, go to this. I want to go to there. And it's
[0:26:31] SPEAKER_01: really, really clear. The other thing you can get is Buddha at the gas pump is a great resource.
[0:26:35] SPEAKER_01: I do with Buddha at the gas pump. I mean, now I've listened to too many. So, but I did with it,
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_01: what I used to do with books. Like I just scroll through it and all my inner voice was like this
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_01: one. Yeah. I'm so curious. And then I would listen. It's almost like I used to say sometimes to
[0:26:54] SPEAKER_01: clients who are creatives, who are stuck that like you have to seduce the muse. Well, I feel that way
[0:27:00] Unknown: about like teachers, like right before I found Reggie and Kieran and Judith, like what are the
[0:27:06] SPEAKER_01: odds we found three teachers in a year? I know. Statistically speaking, it makes no sense. But
[0:27:12] SPEAKER_01: of course, from the higher rhythm, it's perfect. I, right before that, I actually said, hey, life,
[0:27:19] Unknown: like I'd really like another teacher because it had been really years since John Wellwood and
[0:27:25] SPEAKER_01: years since someone I had felt like a connection with. And I was like, I'm really ready. Almost
[0:27:30] Unknown: like when you say like, hey, life, I'm ready to fall in love, like very sincerely and boom,
[0:27:36] Unknown: you know, three of them happened in a year and they just came. So that's a little bit about,
[0:27:45] SPEAKER_01: I guess, how we began, right? Is there more to say about how we began?
[0:27:50] Unknown: No, it makes me like what you were just saying about when you were really ready. It makes me
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_00: want to say a little bit about why. Like why have a teacher? Why have a sangha? Why have a tradition?
[0:28:05] SPEAKER_00: Because it's easy for us, especially in these like heady self-help days to just like keep
[0:28:10] SPEAKER_00: flipping through self-help books or, you know, going to a evening hangout, you know, with all
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_00: different kinds of people or whatever, all of which are totally fine. But, you know, for me,
[0:28:21] SPEAKER_00: when I found Reggie, I wasn't, I didn't have anything in my head like I'm looking to have a
[0:28:27] SPEAKER_00: spiritual practice. I'm looking for a teacher. None of that was even remotely in my mind. But
[0:28:31] SPEAKER_00: what was very clear to me in my life is that I was making a journey. You know, I was in the process
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_00: of a transformation, which I had gotten quite a lot of help and success with, but I still felt
[0:28:43] Unknown: stuck and I felt like there was something bigger and different than like therapy.
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_00: You know, it just, I knew that there was something, there was something deeper. And so when I found
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_00: him, it was for that reason. And then the process for me on the path, you know, as I've become
[0:29:02] Unknown: really dedicated to it, is that, you know, I really don't think you can make the journey for most
[0:29:11] SPEAKER_00: without something. You don't have to have a guru who you put on a pedestal. Pedestals are all kinds
[0:29:16] Unknown: of problems. That's why we have no shortage of examples of gurus behaving badly, you know, but
[0:29:21] Unknown: at the very least, some kind of community, a sangha who is engaged in the same process you are,
[0:29:30] SPEAKER_00: which again, to like use Reggie Ray's definition of what do we mean by spiritual path in the first
[0:29:36] Unknown: place, it's the being deeply engaged in the process of giving birth to your true self, you know. So
[0:29:43] SPEAKER_00: this is not a small thing. And to do it in a vacuum is very hard. And I don't know why this
[0:29:51] SPEAKER_00: just popped into my head, but it's kind of, it would be kind of like trying to get sober in a
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_00: vacuum. Like I'm just going to not talk to anyone about it and just not drink. You know, it's like,
[0:30:00] Unknown: we know from experience, if in humanity, like people need support when they're making a big
[0:30:07] Unknown: journey or a big alchemical transformation or transition in their lives. So I do think that
[0:30:14] Unknown: it's very important to get into the stream if you know you want to be in the stream and it's calling
[0:30:22] SPEAKER_00: to you. And then once you're in the stream, you know, some of those issues about like, how do I
[0:30:28] Unknown: not wind up in a bad situation considering that teachers are going to push back on their own
[0:30:35] SPEAKER_00: considering that teachers are going to push back on you sometimes and make you see parts of yourself
[0:30:39] SPEAKER_00: that you don't want to see. You know, I think about it a lot the way I think about medical care. Like
[0:30:44] SPEAKER_00: if I had a mole on my leg and I went to go see the first doctor I went to go see, he said,
[0:30:49] Unknown: I don't like the looks of that. I think we should amputate. I wouldn't schedule surgery. Like I would
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_00: get multiple second opinions. And I think that,
[0:30:59] Unknown: you know, for me, the guru list path has been really important. Like I could be in Dharma Ocean,
[0:31:04] SPEAKER_00: right, and be going through all of their steps and levels and classes and be like, I am progressing
[0:31:09] SPEAKER_00: on this path that they have laid out towards being a teacher in the Dharma Ocean lineage,
[0:31:13] SPEAKER_00: but it doesn't resonate for me. It feels like I'm jumping through intellectual hoops that I don't
[0:31:18] SPEAKER_00: need to jump through when my process is alive in me. And it's doing things like taking me over to
[0:31:23] SPEAKER_00: Cure and Trace and Judith Blackstone. And, you know, today I need to listen to Adyashanti.
[0:31:29] SPEAKER_00: Tomorrow I need to, you know, watch Byron Katie do the work with people. Who knows, you know, so
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_00: I'm a big fan actually of cross pollination and of letting this process be alive in yourself.
[0:31:45] SPEAKER_00: And of letting this process be alive in yourself.
[0:31:50] SPEAKER_00: And then I know you also have goodies to say about how there are downsides to that too,
[0:31:55] Unknown: because there are. You can get a little thing.
[0:31:58] Unknown: Yeah, you said a lot that I wanted to respond to. Well, so let's lay out like this idea, at least
[0:32:05] SPEAKER_01: in Buddhism, they have an idea. They talk about the Buddha, the Dharma and the noble Sangha. And
[0:32:11] SPEAKER_01: those are like three aspects of your path. And the Buddha is your teacher, your guru.
[0:32:18] SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's a godhead if you're in a Christian tradition or a Jewish tradition, something like
[0:32:22] SPEAKER_01: that, Muslim tradition. And then you have the Dharma, which is the teachings and practices,
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_01: the traditions associated. And then you have the Sangha, which is your community, the people you're
[0:32:32] SPEAKER_01: on the journey with. And Buddha had recommended that you have all three of those. So I'm thinking
[0:32:38] SPEAKER_01: back. And this is really, you see this everywhere, right? It's like Catholics go to church,
[0:32:44] SPEAKER_01: Muslims pray together, right? Like you see that people are in community. You see that there's
[0:32:48] Unknown: always a figurehead and or a god, you know, both. So when I had told the story, I think in meet
[0:32:58] SPEAKER_01: Vanessa, or maybe it was in one of the meditation episodes, I don't know. But it was like, when I
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_01: first found John Wellwood, I did what I typically do. I barely meditated to warm up for it. I went
[0:33:11] SPEAKER_01: on a meditation retreat, having almost never meditated more than 10 minutes and in a very
[0:33:17] Unknown: light hearted, I do energy work kind of way. And then I went on like a six to eight hour meditation
[0:33:23] SPEAKER_01: a day mindfulness retreat. And it was torturous. But I do that I love to just dive in and I drown
[0:33:31] SPEAKER_01: or I don't and that's super fun for me. And so I did that. And I came back and I was meditating
[0:33:35] SPEAKER_01: 45 minutes a day doing the Shambhala style of meditation. And I felt like I was falling apart,
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_01: which is something that has been noted in some of the more recent research around mindfulness,
[0:33:44] SPEAKER_01: like could it be dangerous? You know, we I think we posted an article about that on Facebook.
[0:33:49] SPEAKER_01: Well, I do think that there's something that can arise when you're sitting quietly with yourself
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_01: and all of your unpackaged wounds for 45 minutes a day. But I wasn't in relationship with John
[0:34:02] SPEAKER_01: Wellwood at that point, not until I moved to California. So I didn't have him to ask.
[0:34:07] SPEAKER_01: And I didn't have a community of people to go to. So I felt like I was falling apart.
[0:34:14] Unknown: But was that good or bad? I had no context. And I had no one to support me. This is why it's
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_01: very helpful having something or someone to ground in either in a tradition like I can read
[0:34:27] SPEAKER_01: a book and I can gain understanding on it or in a teacher or in a community of people I can go to
[0:34:35] SPEAKER_01: to start to ground my experience and get some context. When is this useful? When isn't this
[0:34:40] Unknown: useful? So that's like at a very basic level why I think that's good. Now, what you were referring
[0:34:48] SPEAKER_01: to, Brooke, when you said that the downsides that I was going to reference is, you know, I've dabbled.
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_01: I've dabbled most of my life. And I think about Chagiam Chung-Pharimpichai had taught something
[0:35:00] SPEAKER_01: about like, okay, spiritual shopping, like go spiritual shopping, do all of that, dabble,
[0:35:05] SPEAKER_01: learn, listen to podcasts, like do everything Brooke and I are recommending, do that for a year or so.
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_01: He said, and then pick a tradition. And he said, because if you don't, and Chagiam was actually
[0:35:17] SPEAKER_01: pretty open, it wasn't that he was like a Buddhist dogmatic person, it was just pick a tradition,
[0:35:23] Unknown: whatever yours is, and then go deep. Because he said otherwise the risk is you'll build a lot of
[0:35:28] SPEAKER_01: shallow holes and you'll never get to the depths. Now, Brooke has some disagreement on that concept
[0:35:35] Unknown: based on what she had shared prior at least, but here's what I get about it. As a dabbler,
[0:35:41] SPEAKER_01: as someone who still dabbles because I have, hello, three different teachers and they're not all in
[0:35:45] Unknown: the same tradition, is this, we have a way of hiding, period. We have a way of using our spiritual
[0:35:55] SPEAKER_01: super ego. That's why if you all have ever listened to JP Sears, and if not, stop listening to this
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_01: and go listen to him immediately. Like his whole work is built off of the spiritual super ego,
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_01: right? Like we have all of these comfy places that our ego will hide and delude us. And frankly,
[0:36:15] SPEAKER_01: you can't see what you can't see, period. You just can't see. You can't see how you're operating
[0:36:22] SPEAKER_01: all of the time because you're running the game, right? You're running the delusion, so you're
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_01: caught in the mire of it. So what I think choosing a path, be it a teacher, a tradition, a sangha,
[0:36:35] SPEAKER_01: hopefully all, because they often come interwoven, but when you find a path, is there's less wiggle
[0:36:41] SPEAKER_01: room for your ego to co-opt just what works from it and to hide from what is going to push it into
[0:36:48] Unknown: its uncomfortable zone and to push it into growth. So when we have, so right now we have these three
[0:36:56] Unknown: different teachers that we spoke about, but Kieran will not let me wiggle for fuck's sake, try as I
[0:37:05] SPEAKER_01: might. Right? Norwood Reggie, if I was in front of him, Norwood Reggie and Norwood Judith, she's
[0:37:12] SPEAKER_01: just way more chill about it. She's so freaking sweet. I know. Bless her in the way that she
[0:37:19] SPEAKER_01: confronts you. So I don't think that even though we're kind of like drawing from our alive wells,
[0:37:27] SPEAKER_01: A, I think we're farther into a process so we can pull from different traditions.
[0:37:32] SPEAKER_01: And B, we have not picked any easy ways to delude ourselves.
[0:37:37] SPEAKER_00: No. And all of the, so that's what I would disagree about and have disagreed about with you is
[0:37:47] SPEAKER_00: I've seen that, right? I've seen it with people where they do just dig tons of tiny little
[0:37:51] SPEAKER_00: shallow holes and it's like, I'm into bliss. I'm into bliss consciousness. And so they'll just like,
[0:37:56] SPEAKER_00: go do a little night here and bliss out and then I'll go over to these people over and then I'm
[0:38:00] SPEAKER_00: going to go on this week long trip with this energy healer. It's all about bliss consciousness
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_00: and it's just bliss, bliss, bliss. And what they really need to do is confront the fact that they
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_00: are really shitty to everyone they have a relationship with in their life or whatever.
[0:38:16] SPEAKER_00: So I've seen that for sure. Ideally, so for us, for me, I have a variety of teachers and a variety
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_00: of teachings that I draw on, but none of them allow wiggle room. You know, like I'm never going
[0:38:33] SPEAKER_00: to spend a week with Judith Blackstone and have her just be like, yeah, whatever makes you feel
[0:38:39] SPEAKER_00: good, Brooke. You know, like she's not ever going to encourage spiritual bypassing. And I think that
[0:38:45] SPEAKER_00: it just comes down to the chops of teachers. Reggie would never encourage spiritual bypassing.
[0:38:48] SPEAKER_00: Kieran certainly doesn't let anyone get away with spiritual bypassing. So that's really the like,
[0:38:53] SPEAKER_00: judge is draw from a wide variety of teachers, but none of whom are just ultra spiritual in the world
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_00: of JP Sears. None of whom are just spiritual ego making and just making it all, you know, mystical
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_00: and you're, you're different from everyone and more special and whatever feels good. You know,
[0:39:16] SPEAKER_00: I remember at one point in our first week of training with Judith, she was talking about how,
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_00: you know, her work is deep, deep, profound embodiment. And she was saying that she had
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_00: noticed so many people who she comes out of a Zen tradition, right? And people who have been
[0:39:32] SPEAKER_00: lifelong meditators, they just keep opening along the lines that they're comfortable opening. So
[0:39:37] SPEAKER_00: if somebody's got a lot of up head, eyes, up and out energy, they're just going to keep going up
[0:39:43] SPEAKER_00: and out because it's the groove that has the most wear in it. So you need to make sure you're
[0:39:49] SPEAKER_00: working with people who are high integrity in the sense that they keep bringing you back to balance.
[0:39:53] SPEAKER_00: Like if you're somebody who likes to go up and out, they're going to bring you down and in,
[0:39:57] SPEAKER_00: you know, so I think as opposed to thinking of it in the way that I think a lot of people do,
[0:40:03] SPEAKER_00: just because there's this spiritual misconception that you need to like pick a perfect guru and just
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_00: give your life to them forever. You know, whatever they say and there, you don't push back on them.
[0:40:17] SPEAKER_00: You don't wonder where the path is taking you. You just hand yourself over on a silver platter.
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_00: I think that that's a weird idea that has gotten baked into the word spiritual. And I don't think
[0:40:29] Unknown: that there's truth to that. Well, I think certainly people would hotly debate you on that
[0:40:36] SPEAKER_01: actually, because sometimes like that is kind of the concept of gurus, like in the idea being that
[0:40:44] Unknown: they can see what you can't see, right? Especially if you had an enlightened guru,
[0:40:49] Unknown: right? The idea is they can see everything. So you have to surrender to them, right? That's like the
[0:40:55] SPEAKER_01: guru practice and yoga, they have a whole lineage that's like guru yoga, which is like how to be in
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: service of this. Ram Dass is actually that. Ram Dass completely just surrendered to his guru.
[0:41:09] SPEAKER_01: That's how he did it. So now I don't really get behind that energy either,
[0:41:14] SPEAKER_01: but there are people who would say that that is great. I don't think I trust humans enough
[0:41:21] Unknown: to think that's a great idea. I don't know. But I do want to bring together something you were
[0:41:26] SPEAKER_01: saying. So you have Judith, Kier and Reggie, we have three different teachers, just what we're
[0:41:30] Unknown: saying. However, there is a common theme, which is embodied meditation and embodiment.
[0:41:37] Unknown: It's all down and in. It's all down and in. So in a way, it's like, we're still digging one deep hole.
[0:41:47] Unknown: We just found these different voices to support us and they actually support us in different ways.
[0:41:54] SPEAKER_01: Really. Right. So, you know, that's something interesting to consider. It's like Reggie just
[0:42:00] SPEAKER_01: doesn't work one on one with people the way Kieran does. Neither does Judith. And they all offer like
[0:42:06] SPEAKER_01: this different nuance. So anyway, that's part of it. That's part of the digging deep holes.
[0:42:11] Unknown: Then I'm thinking about safety. And I was thinking about how, okay, so all of the people we've chosen
[0:42:20] SPEAKER_01: will kind of hold your feet to the fire. And that's what you want in a teacher. It's what you want
[0:42:24] Unknown: actually in a spiritual sangha too. But they never do it by breaking me. There is not a hurt feeling.
[0:42:36] Unknown: And a really evolved teacher, they give different medicine to different people.
[0:42:43] SPEAKER_01: It's like they can feel where you're at and they meet you there and they just take you a little
[0:42:48] Unknown: beyond. So it shouldn't feel painful. You shouldn't feel scorned. You shouldn't feel judged. You
[0:42:57] SPEAKER_01: shouldn't feel like someone's trying to break you down. That was one of the things that Bikram was
[0:43:01] SPEAKER_01: doing with people is he breaks you down. He makes you lose sleep so you could become superhuman.
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_01: And he makes you watch videos of him. I mean, it's an actual, he would come from the level of
[0:43:14] SPEAKER_01: break you down to build you up. But most teachers that I think you and I are resonant with,
[0:43:19] SPEAKER_01: Brooke, I think I can speak for you on this. They just know we're all one and we're already God.
[0:43:25] SPEAKER_01: There's no sense of like, I have to break down your ego. It's more like, let's see where the
[0:43:30] SPEAKER_01: growing edge is. Let's see where the limitation is and let's see if that can be released and
[0:43:34] SPEAKER_01: let's see if that can be embodied. It's not a tear down process. Would you agree?
[0:43:37] Unknown: Yeah. And then the other thing I was thinking in terms of safety, and I don't know if this comes
[0:43:44] SPEAKER_01: with our age, so I don't know if like you would feel the same, but somewhere along the line,
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_01: I developed a healthy notion of all teachers are only human.
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So important to keep that front of mind. There is no such thing, even someone who's fully
[0:44:02] SPEAKER_00: enlightened as like a special other person who doesn't have to participate in the normal rules
[0:44:09] Unknown: of integrity human beings. Yeah. Well, and I don't know, you know,
[0:44:13] SPEAKER_01: there are people who I haven't met, like they talk about Ramana Maharshi this way or Ram Dass's
[0:44:20] SPEAKER_01: teacher, Maharaji as like really saintly, like enlightened and saintly as shit, you know,
[0:44:28] Unknown: and everyone kind of has the same impression of them. But those are very few and far between.
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_01: Moreover, if you guys are all looking for a teacher, the odds are you're not going to stumble
[0:44:40] SPEAKER_01: upon the saintly enlightened being. The odds are you're going to stumble upon people with a
[0:44:45] SPEAKER_01: lot of wisdom and a lot to share who are human. And maybe they've evolved past a lot of limitations,
[0:44:53] SPEAKER_01: but they still have lenses that are operating. They still have preferences and habits. And
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_01: so that means that you treat them as humans who have a ton to offer you who you can give a lot
[0:45:07] Unknown: of reference to, but not gods. Yeah. And you and I, like for those who are listening and they hear
[0:45:15] SPEAKER_00: us saying, show him trunk, show him trunk, purr, Rinpoche. And they know what that means. They know
[0:45:19] SPEAKER_00: who he is. Yeah. It's just worth touching in. If we're talking about this, we might as well talk
[0:45:24] SPEAKER_00: about it. You know, so you've always known that he is your teacher, you know, in a very direct way.
[0:45:28] SPEAKER_00: And I am a part of a lineage that comes from him, Dharma Ocean, Regi Ray. I don't know that
[0:45:36] SPEAKER_00: if he were still living, that I would be able to call him my teacher. You know, here is somebody
[0:45:41] SPEAKER_00: who was very challenging. He did sleep with his students a lot. He did things that, you know,
[0:45:45] SPEAKER_00: from this distance in the future, compared to where he used to be, you know, and not having
[0:45:51] SPEAKER_00: a relationship with him. I'm like, God, I don't, I couldn't be cool with that. And yet the people
[0:45:58] SPEAKER_00: who I know who did have relationships with him, Regi Ray, Pema Chodron, they talk about him as
[0:46:06] SPEAKER_00: profoundly loving, you know, and the way he loved you is that he wanted your awakening for you more
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_00: than anything else, you know, so that that was like the most profound love. So I don't have a
[0:46:20] Unknown: personal experience, but you know, it's just worth mentioning. I don't know, like what my lived
[0:46:25] SPEAKER_00: experience would be if this teacher were still alive. I don't know that I could hang with him
[0:46:29] SPEAKER_01: as my teacher. So well, you can't know, because you can't experience him, right? It's like,
[0:46:35] SPEAKER_01: I think I told you once when I was on a retreat with John Wellwood, and he was doing some work
[0:46:40] SPEAKER_01: with a client, because John's a psychologist and a Buddhist, and he was doing work in front of the
[0:46:44] SPEAKER_01: group. And he said something to the woman that was very profound, in my opinion, but he kind of
[0:46:50] SPEAKER_01: called her out on something like you're not just doing that for your for them, you were doing it
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_01: for yourself. It was like something in that genre of comment. And afterwards, he got torn to shreds
[0:46:59] SPEAKER_01: by the group like that was so mean, you were so unempathetic to her. Now, that's not at all how
[0:47:07] SPEAKER_01: I perceived it first. Second, it is not how the client perceived it. She found it profoundly
[0:47:13] Unknown: loving, because it was right on, gave her an awakening to something within herself. Three,
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_01: what John explained was that in Buddhism, there's two different ways you look at compassion. So
[0:47:27] SPEAKER_01: the first is this typical like holding like a container like, ah, come and I will give you
[0:47:32] Unknown: space to exist. And actually, strangely enough, that's the masculine side of compassion in
[0:47:38] SPEAKER_01: Buddhism. And then the other side, the feminine side, it's called the sword of prajna. Prajna
[0:47:43] Unknown: means wisdom. So it's the compassion of cutting through people's delusions. And that that is,
[0:47:52] Unknown: to me, profoundly compassionate, because in my experience, and granted, I'm just naturally built
[0:47:59] SPEAKER_01: for spaciousness. But in my experience, that's easier, because there's not a lot of risk, I'm
[0:48:04] SPEAKER_01: going to hurt your feelings. There is risk, I'll fall into idiot compassion, and I'll enable you.
[0:48:10] SPEAKER_01: But there's not a lot of risk, I'll get into conflict with you. But if I want to call you out
[0:48:16] SPEAKER_01: on your shit, and cut through some of your delusions, there is some risk, you can take it
[0:48:21] SPEAKER_01: hard, you can take it the wrong way, you can get upset. I mean, it's happened. It happens to me,
[0:48:26] Unknown: you know, where people can upset me like that. So I always found that to be the most profoundly
[0:48:32] SPEAKER_01: loving thing. Yeah. Now that's where it gets tricky. When we're trying to ascertain it's
[0:48:38] SPEAKER_01: like being in a relationship. And is this person abusive? Or are they just telling me something
[0:48:42] SPEAKER_01: honestly? Are they communicating in a way that is healthy? Or are they communicating in a way that's
[0:48:49] SPEAKER_01: inflammatory? And unless you've known a good relationship, how do you know if you're in one?
[0:48:54] SPEAKER_01: Right? So, you know, it is a little dodgy. But for the most part, when I've had someone say
[0:49:01] Unknown: something to me that's a little harsh, it's very quick before I'm like, Oh, that was really true,
[0:49:08] SPEAKER_01: though. That was for my own. Yeah, there's a relief that comes on the heels of what?
[0:49:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. And maybe the last thing we could say about it is that if something feels abusive to
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_01: you in the sense that something feels culty, or it feels like a teacher's being mean, or someone's
[0:49:29] SPEAKER_01: trying to break down your ego structures in a way that feels unsafe, maybe just that's not your
[0:49:34] SPEAKER_01: teacher for now. You know, maybe they're not good or bad. Maybe it's just not for you. Yeah,
[0:49:40] SPEAKER_01: we get to say no thank you to things. Yeah, no thank you right now. You know, there's different
[0:49:45] SPEAKER_01: medicine for different people at different times. And so you may listen to, let's say,
[0:49:50] SPEAKER_01: Karen and be like, Oh, God, no, thank you. How did Brooke and Vanessa love her so much? And it's like,
[0:49:55] Unknown: well, maybe she's not for you right now. Maybe never. But that's just how that is. And you get
[0:50:03] SPEAKER_01: to kind of like, follow your impulse without over analyzing it. Because this doesn't have to be
[0:50:10] SPEAKER_01: about making a tradition or a teacher right or wrong, good or bad. It really just has to be about
[0:50:16] SPEAKER_01: like, where is your next growing edge? Where's there room for you to have a little more freedom
[0:50:21] SPEAKER_01: and a little more freedom? And then following into that and then seeing what happens and then keep
[0:50:27] Unknown: going. Does it feel like a yes? Does it feel like a yes? Yes. And then follow into that. Even these
[0:50:33] Unknown: teachers, if at some point they feel like a no, they then I will thank them for their help and I
[0:50:39] SPEAKER_01: will devote my reverence to them and I'll walk the other direction. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the path
[0:50:45] Unknown: is doing itself. You know, we don't solve it as a problem from the level of the mind. We just let it
[0:50:53] SPEAKER_00: unfold and we do that through whatever yes comes along, you know, and then there's always like,
[0:51:01] SPEAKER_00: build yourself a wide web of support in your life to check in with so everything doesn't rest on some
[0:51:08] SPEAKER_01: pedestalized guru. I am thinking that people just are not having these kinds of conversations
[0:51:14] SPEAKER_01: enough. I get that sense just even from the way people have sent us notes and everything about
[0:51:20] SPEAKER_01: the podcast that it's like refreshing just to be able to have these conversations about things
[0:51:25] SPEAKER_01: people are thinking about. So it's very helpful to have a spiritual friend, which by the way,
[0:51:30] Unknown: guru and Buddhism is spiritual friend. So if anyone feels like they're being much higher than you,
[0:51:40] Unknown: you probably have a problem. Yeah. But maybe, I don't know, we'll toy around with how we can
[0:51:48] SPEAKER_01: assist in that so that we can all be in conversation more because I think that's how you can also start
[0:51:55] SPEAKER_01: to decipher. Is this just my ego reacting to a teacher or do a teaching or is this really
[0:52:01] SPEAKER_01: genuine for me? Because I don't know, for me, I can spot my bullshit way more when I'm saying it out loud.
[0:52:09] Unknown: Yeah. Yep. And then of course, you have these kind others who help you out. So I don't know,
[0:52:15] SPEAKER_01: do you think like, did we do justice to this? We did something to this. So that's a start.
[0:52:20] Unknown: You all can let us know. Did we do anything to answer this topic?
[0:52:29] Unknown: We'll have more to say over time. It'll be good. We'll always revisit.
[0:52:32] Unknown: And just come with the questions, I guess, because maybe you have even more than when you first started.

[0:54:08] SPEAKER_01: relatable and engaging manner. Their conversations include insights from their years of study,
[0:54:14] SPEAKER_01: their own spiritual journeys, and their various areas of expertise and are smart, yes, accessible.
[0:54:21] SPEAKER_01: Bliss and grit leaves me with ideas to play with in my own life and makes me think, right, exactly,
[0:54:26] SPEAKER_01: or I never thought of it like that. Best of all, this is like listening in on a conversation
[0:54:31] SPEAKER_01: between two of your best girlfriends. So it's fun. These are two smart, talented women putting
