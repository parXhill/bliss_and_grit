[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls.
[0:00:08] SPEAKER_00: You're listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:10] SPEAKER_00: I'm Brooke Thomas.
[0:00:11] SPEAKER_00: I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scato.
[0:00:15] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're talking about being on the embodied spiritual path, and what does
[0:00:19] SPEAKER_00: that even mean?
[0:00:20] SPEAKER_00: So, what's a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:22] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:24] SPEAKER_00: All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human
[0:00:29] SPEAKER_00: life.
[0:00:30] SPEAKER_00: We're attempting to sort it out for ourselves here on the show.
[0:00:33] SPEAKER_00: In today's episode, we're talking about life as an empath.
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_00: A lot of you out there listening are empaths, and this actually sprung out of our last episode
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_00: about energy.
[0:00:44] SPEAKER_00: We realized how helpful understanding the energetic underpinnings of patterns has helped
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: us to be in our lives as empaths.
[0:00:52] SPEAKER_00: So, if you're an empath or a highly sensitive person or a sensi, as we like to say, you've
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_00: probably gotten really good at some management techniques for how to not get overwhelmed
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: by the world.
[0:01:05] SPEAKER_00: Maybe you've encountered a number of well-intentioned people who teach techniques about how to shield
[0:01:10] Unknown: yourself from feeling too much or getting overwhelmed.
[0:01:15] SPEAKER_00: The problem is managing and shielding is hard, fatiguing work.
[0:01:20] SPEAKER_00: So what if instead we could learn how to land in ourselves, I mean really inhabit ourselves
[0:01:27] SPEAKER_00: so we don't feel like we're at the whims of our environment and we don't also feel like
[0:01:30] SPEAKER_00: we need to be vigilant against the environment and against our sensi selves?
[0:01:36] SPEAKER_00: That's what we're diving into today.
[0:01:38] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, we would be thrilled if you left a review on iTunes or on our Facebook
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_00: page which is Bliss and Grit.
[0:01:45] SPEAKER_00: You can also head over to blissandgrit.com and subscribe to hear updates on upcoming
[0:01:49] SPEAKER_00: events we might have coming up.
[0:01:50] SPEAKER_00: We're running our first digital song, our first event, which we call the Being Human
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_00: series right now and it has been so nourishing and so lovely, which is such a sweet, sweet,
[0:02:01] SPEAKER_00: sweet group of people.
[0:02:02] SPEAKER_00: So we know we're loving it.
[0:02:04] SPEAKER_00: We know we're going to do some more stuff.
[0:02:06] SPEAKER_00: So you can stay tuned to find out about that.
[0:02:10] SPEAKER_00: One last note before we head into the conversation.
[0:02:13] SPEAKER_00: As you might know, Vanessa and I swear, so if there are kids around, you may want to
[0:02:17] SPEAKER_00: wear some headphones.
[0:02:18] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:22] SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Brooke.
[0:02:24] SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Vanessa.
[0:02:26] SPEAKER_01: I'm overly excited to record today's episode.
[0:02:32] SPEAKER_01: And I thought I would just kick it off with a quote that we posted on social media actually
[0:02:38] SPEAKER_01: yesterday.
[0:02:39] SPEAKER_01: So you're all listening in real time kind of.
[0:02:43] SPEAKER_01: So here's how it goes.
[0:02:45] SPEAKER_01: He says, we need to be clear that each of us has our own responsibility, that it's not
[0:02:51] SPEAKER_01: necessary for you to feel everything somebody else feels.
[0:02:55] SPEAKER_01: What somebody else feels is theirs to feel.
[0:02:59] Unknown: You may have access to it, but that doesn't mean it's yours to experience.
[0:03:04] SPEAKER_01: There's sometimes an underlying infatuation with one's empathic ability, which can itself
[0:03:09] Unknown: be problematic.
[0:03:11] SPEAKER_01: Part of you may find it unpleasant to feel what's happening with people, but another
[0:03:15] Unknown: part might like it.
[0:03:18] SPEAKER_01: It's like eavesdropping on someone's energetic state.
[0:03:22] SPEAKER_01: If we unconsciously find that pleasurable, then it will happen more and more.
[0:03:27] SPEAKER_01: If on the other hand, we're not actually that interested, we're not pushing it away, but
[0:03:31] SPEAKER_01: we're not seeking it out either, then our attention goes where it is appropriate for
[0:03:35] Unknown: it to go.
[0:03:37] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes it's appropriate to feel what others are feeling, especially if you're in relationship
[0:03:41] SPEAKER_01: with them, can help you to understand them on a kinesthetic level.
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_01: You start to realize it's not necessary to go around feeling what everybody else is feeling
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_01: when you're not in relationship with them.
[0:03:51] SPEAKER_01: You realize their business is their business, not yours.
[0:03:57] Unknown: Actually we did get a lot of responsiveness on this quote.
[0:04:02] SPEAKER_01: Last week, or last episode that we aired, we were talking about energy.
[0:04:07] SPEAKER_01: I guess what struck me so much about this quote, because it really struck me as powerful,
[0:04:12] Unknown: was recently you and I were talking about being empathic.
[0:04:19] SPEAKER_01: We were talking about how empaths are actually in one way super controlling.
[0:04:25] SPEAKER_01: We act like, oh, I'm at the whim of my environment.
[0:04:29] SPEAKER_01: In reality, we're constantly reading the energy in an ecosystem and then trying to modulate
[0:04:36] SPEAKER_01: or trying to adjust it so that it's not disharmonious or it's not overstimulating.
[0:04:44] Unknown: As somebody who's a sensi and as somebody who works with a lot of sensis, something
[0:04:51] Unknown: that you often get the sense of is that it feels like something's happening to you.
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_01: You just have this hyperactive nervous system.
[0:05:01] SPEAKER_01: As you talk about highly sensitive people, they'll describe it like you have this big
[0:05:05] Unknown: antenna.
[0:05:07] SPEAKER_01: It's like everyone has an antenna, but you have a very big antenna and you're picking
[0:05:11] SPEAKER_01: up on all the broadcast signals in this very strong way.
[0:05:15] Unknown: In that description, which feels apt, it's sort of like something's happening to you
[0:05:22] SPEAKER_01: and it will always be happening to you.
[0:05:25] SPEAKER_01: The best one can do is manage that.
[0:05:29] Unknown: I feel like there are some experts out there that really speak at that level.
[0:05:34] SPEAKER_01: Like, okay, energy is always going to come, so wear white and wash your hands and say
[0:05:40] SPEAKER_01: a prayer and put up a psychic boundary with light.
[0:05:44] SPEAKER_01: They'll give you all sorts of management techniques.
[0:05:48] SPEAKER_01: I've used those in my life.
[0:05:49] SPEAKER_01: I found it kind of tiring.
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_01: It still makes it very tiring to be around people because you have to put attentional
[0:05:56] SPEAKER_01: energy on management techniques.
[0:06:00] SPEAKER_01: I've also found that ultimately it didn't work so well.
[0:06:03] SPEAKER_01: I would still go and go through a day with clients and then I'd talk to an energy worker
[0:06:08] Unknown: and they'd be like, well, you're really absorbing energy.
[0:06:13] SPEAKER_01: In this last couple of years, as you and I have had the grace of finding perhaps maybe
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_01: teachers is a good way to say it.
[0:06:24] SPEAKER_01: I recognized that yes, I'm wired to be sensitive and I think that's just part of how Vanessa
[0:06:32] SPEAKER_01: came into this world, but that I have a gross level of participation in this pattern that
[0:06:39] Unknown: I had never understood before.
[0:06:43] Unknown: Working with Kieran, understanding when I worked with Kieran Trace that I have belief systems
[0:06:50] Unknown: like I'm responsible for how other people feel, like it's my job to make people happy,
[0:06:56] SPEAKER_01: like a more foundational one we can all have, like suffering is a problem, therefore it
[0:07:02] Unknown: has to be fixed.
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_01: I could see those belief systems and as I began to understand them, I could understand
[0:07:09] Unknown: why I was doing what Adia pointed to, like eavesdropping, like listening in and making
[0:07:16] SPEAKER_01: people's business my business.
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_01: When I studied with Judith Blackstone and when we finished her training, I could get
[0:07:22] SPEAKER_01: a real visceral sense of how my coping strategy as an empath was to open my body so that I
[0:07:31] SPEAKER_01: was always in connection with people so they would never feel a disharmony and it would
[0:07:36] SPEAKER_01: never be unsafe and there's a lot to that strategy and so on and so forth.
[0:07:43] Unknown: I just thought a couple of things.
[0:07:45] Unknown: One would be really useful to talk about life as a sensei, life as an empath through this
[0:07:52] SPEAKER_01: energetic level, the energetic dimension, especially including some of the strategies
[0:07:57] Unknown: we've used to cope that now become very problematic for us and very uncomfortable for us that
[0:08:05] SPEAKER_01: all too often we could then feel victimized by and to shed some light on a different perspective
[0:08:13] SPEAKER_01: than the one that I've been hearing prior to a year or two ago.
[0:08:20] SPEAKER_00: So much to say, so much to unpack.
[0:08:23] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[0:08:24] SPEAKER_01: How's that?
[0:08:25] SPEAKER_01: I just poured it all out.
[0:08:26] SPEAKER_00: No, it's good.
[0:08:27] Unknown: I think it's super important and you and I both know because we have a chance to communicate
[0:08:33] SPEAKER_00: with blessing great listeners that like a lot of you listening, find yourselves in the
[0:08:38] SPEAKER_00: in the empath camp and you and I have a huge passion about trying to aid in that kind of
[0:08:44] SPEAKER_00: journey as much as possible.
[0:08:45] SPEAKER_00: So yeah, this is really critically important and just listening to you to describe what
[0:08:51] SPEAKER_00: I know in a very familiar way about how to manage your life as a sensitive person, how
[0:08:58] SPEAKER_00: do you use those tools, how do you feel safe, even things like just take lots of recharge
[0:09:03] SPEAKER_00: time alone, which is like a lovely bit of advice and I utilize it plenty and I always
[0:09:08] SPEAKER_00: will.
[0:09:09] Unknown: But any of those management strategies, they just feel at a certain point just so fatiguing.
[0:09:17] SPEAKER_00: Like it was exhausting just listening to you to describe it even though I know the inner
[0:09:20] SPEAKER_00: workings of all that advice so well.
[0:09:23] Unknown: It's just like it's heavy because so those of us who are empaths, I would say that there's
[0:09:30] SPEAKER_00: probably lots of reasons why people are sensitive or empathic.
[0:09:34] SPEAKER_00: But I would say that probably high 90s percent of us had environments that required it.
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_00: We had to leave ourselves and go into the other people, meaning home life, you know,
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_00: parents, siblings, maybe whoever was around in the household so that we could scan what's
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_00: going on with them so that we could be prepared for what might be coming.
[0:10:03] SPEAKER_00: And that might not even necessarily be big catastrophic explosive abuse, although certainly
[0:10:08] SPEAKER_00: that's one thing for sure.
[0:10:10] SPEAKER_00: It could also just be things like having a very highly anxious parent and you love them
[0:10:15] SPEAKER_00: and you feel that anxiety and you want to make it better.
[0:10:20] SPEAKER_00: So you are like in them, like is today going to be a good day or a bad day for them?
[0:10:25] SPEAKER_00: Oh, if I have trouble with my math homework, is that going to spike off anxiety?
[0:10:30] Unknown: And so you're scanning your environment to keep yourself safe.
[0:10:35] SPEAKER_00: So you're already, your life is already from a very early stage about managing your world,
[0:10:40] SPEAKER_00: managing your environment.
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_00: You learned it as a management tool.
[0:10:46] SPEAKER_00: And the base of that, like the foundation of that is a few different stories.
[0:10:54] SPEAKER_00: Life is overwhelming.
[0:10:56] Unknown: Life is too much.
[0:10:59] SPEAKER_00: And I have to keep myself safe.
[0:11:03] SPEAKER_00: And I have to keep myself safe by constantly using all this energy and all these strategies
[0:11:09] SPEAKER_00: to scan my environment and jump out of it and manage things.
[0:11:14] SPEAKER_00: That's fatiguing, really fatiguing, which is why all of us wind up with endocrine disruption,
[0:11:21] SPEAKER_00: all the adrenal burnout, all the autoimmune stuff.
[0:11:25] SPEAKER_00: And there's a lot of great research about that too.
[0:11:27] SPEAKER_00: Actually, I just got the book, The Body Says No by Gabor Mate, which I haven't read yet,
[0:11:31] Unknown: but I'll fill you all in when I do, which he basically talks about this, that there
[0:11:35] SPEAKER_00: are these certain health conditions that happen for these kinds of people, where our environment
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_00: was so much and we couldn't say no in the moment.
[0:11:44] SPEAKER_00: And so our body says no for us by shutting down or attacking itself.
[0:11:49] SPEAKER_00: That's so unfamiliar to me.
[0:11:51] SPEAKER_00: I know.
[0:11:52] SPEAKER_00: It's so what?
[0:11:53] SPEAKER_00: Why am I mold thing?
[0:11:54] Unknown: Not at all.
[0:11:55] SPEAKER_00: So we have that, right?
[0:11:57] SPEAKER_00: That's how we grow up.
[0:11:58] SPEAKER_00: And then along comes these people who are intending to help or these strategies, whatever,
[0:12:04] SPEAKER_00: who are saying, here's how to do more managing, oh, you who have been managing your world
[0:12:09] Unknown: since forever.
[0:12:12] SPEAKER_00: Here's more management techniques.
[0:12:13] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, oh, good, this one's going to keep me safe.
[0:12:15] SPEAKER_00: And so it's like, you just keep piling on the management, the management, the management.
[0:12:18] SPEAKER_00: You just keep getting more and more and more and more tired.
[0:12:21] Unknown: And at a certain point, and this is why it's a useful, timely conversation for you and
[0:12:26] SPEAKER_00: I, at a certain point, you just bottom out on that.
[0:12:29] SPEAKER_00: Like, there's just no more managing you can do.
[0:12:32] SPEAKER_00: And you start to question the stories that are making it required, the stories like life
[0:12:38] SPEAKER_00: is too much, I'll never be able to manage at all.
[0:12:42] SPEAKER_00: I have to keep myself safe.
[0:12:45] SPEAKER_00: All these different stories start to become like, is that totally true?
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_00: And you can pull the thread and they can start to dismantle.
[0:12:54] SPEAKER_00: So you and I have started to, and I would say we're like maybe in the toddler stage,
[0:12:59] Unknown: we've started to really, which by the way is like high level ninja warriorship.
[0:13:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying that in a demeaning way, it's just that I see just because I'm at toddler
[0:13:10] SPEAKER_00: I'm up on my feet and I'm taking my uncertain first steps.
[0:13:14] SPEAKER_00: I can see just how much I don't have to manage anything.
[0:13:18] SPEAKER_00: Like I can see the expanse of that pasture in front of me.
[0:13:23] Unknown: And so it's so helpful to be able to like bring this to people, this glimmer of hope.
[0:13:30] Unknown: There is a place where those stories don't have to run your life and you don't have to
[0:13:35] SPEAKER_00: be managing things all the time.
[0:13:36] SPEAKER_00: And it requires, there's so many different little avenues of conversation we could take
[0:13:41] Unknown: on this, but so much of it requires letting go of the identity of yourself as the empath,
[0:13:48] SPEAKER_00: which takes other identities like the helper, the good one, the nice one.
[0:13:53] SPEAKER_00: I would say most of us have careers in healing arts of some variety or another, whether it's
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_00: manual movement therapy, yoga teacher, therapist, social worker, nursing, like we're the helpers,
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_00: and we're tired.
[0:14:09] SPEAKER_01: And even if you're not in that career, what I noticed is people can still self-identify
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_01: as the helper when their job isn't aligned like that.
[0:14:22] SPEAKER_01: So anyone, people could be on a trading floor, they could be in any role in the world, customer
[0:14:30] SPEAKER_01: service representative, I don't know.
[0:14:32] SPEAKER_01: And they can still find that within their life and their social circle, they are the
[0:14:36] SPEAKER_01: designated helper.
[0:14:38] Unknown: They are the one that they're like, this may sound familiar to all of you, they're the
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_01: client who'll say to me like, why am I at a party and people are coming over and telling
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_01: me their problems?
[0:14:50] SPEAKER_01: Or like, why when I am so overwhelmed and overloaded, are my friends all also calling
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_01: me to ask me for advice or to be their rock?
[0:15:00] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, well, you know, there's something probably essential about that person where
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_01: they know how to listen, they know how to respond.
[0:15:08] SPEAKER_01: And some of that is probably fundamental to them.
[0:15:11] SPEAKER_01: And then some of that, as you said, Brooke, it's our survival strategies, you know, that
[0:15:16] SPEAKER_01: we develop in order to cope with our difficult ecosystem.
[0:15:20] Unknown: But I always liked like, when John Wellwood had said that our defenses are born of our
[0:15:26] SPEAKER_01: gifts.
[0:15:27] SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes, yes.
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:15:31] SPEAKER_00: And it's not like reject the empath in you.
[0:15:34] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:15:35] SPEAKER_01: No, because he's saying, you know, ultimately, if you weren't gifted at it, you couldn't
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_01: use it as a survival mechanism.
[0:15:42] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:15:43] SPEAKER_01: And so that, you know, Vanessa can't be the class clown if she's not particularly funny.
[0:15:47] SPEAKER_01: I am funny.
[0:15:48] Unknown: You are not class clown funny.
[0:15:52] SPEAKER_01: Like that just couldn't be my defense strategy.
[0:15:55] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:15:56] SPEAKER_01: Like everyone's got their defense strategy.
[0:15:59] SPEAKER_01: In my household, like my sister had a way of kind of standing up to my parents and being
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_01: a little more rebellious and kind of fighting and standing her ground a little differently
[0:16:08] SPEAKER_01: than me.
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_01: I was more the harmonizer, the person who like ameliorated conflict.
[0:16:14] SPEAKER_01: Why?
[0:16:15] SPEAKER_01: You know, we just had different aptitudes.
[0:16:17] SPEAKER_01: It was just fundamental to us.
[0:16:20] Unknown: So fundamentally, people were relating to this were sensitive, but not sensitive just
[0:16:27] SPEAKER_01: as an I have a lot of emotions.
[0:16:29] Unknown: They were attuned to vibrations.
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:16:33] SPEAKER_01: They were tuned to the subtle level of reality.
[0:16:35] SPEAKER_01: They were tuned to caring about how other people felt.
[0:16:41] SPEAKER_01: And so that's just a natural inclination.
[0:16:44] SPEAKER_01: It's like Vanessa, Vanessa, it's what it is.
[0:16:47] SPEAKER_01: I attune to how people are.
[0:16:50] Unknown: That's what I do.
[0:16:51] SPEAKER_01: Then it becomes a coping strategy.
[0:16:55] SPEAKER_01: One thing I've noticed, you know, being an empath is like in part it's because I cared
[0:17:00] SPEAKER_01: about people.
[0:17:01] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:17:02] SPEAKER_01: So here I am and paying good attention.
[0:17:05] SPEAKER_01: I'm little.
[0:17:06] SPEAKER_01: I notice my parents are suffering quite a bit.
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:17:10] SPEAKER_01: You notice your family system suffering quite a bit.
[0:17:13] SPEAKER_01: Most children, I really believe just want everyone to be happy.
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_01: Like they just don't get it when people are not and they really want that for them.
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_01: So out of love for my family, I wanted everyone to be happy.
[0:17:27] SPEAKER_01: And so part of my coping strategy developed to help others.
[0:17:32] Unknown: Right.
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_01: And then part of it was your distress is distressing me.
[0:17:37] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:17:38] SPEAKER_01: Like your loud noises, your fighting, your pain, your inability to connect, your tendency
[0:17:44] SPEAKER_01: to project.
[0:17:45] SPEAKER_01: Like these things are hurting me.
[0:17:47] SPEAKER_01: And so I want to manage the situation, make you all smile, make you all laugh, make you
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_01: all feel better so that I can rest.
[0:17:56] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:17:57] Unknown: And I can finally feel at ease.
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_01: And so this becomes a little bit of a way of being.
[0:18:03] SPEAKER_01: Now it's very easy as a psychologist, we can think about that as like, like at a psychological
[0:18:09] SPEAKER_01: level.
[0:18:10] SPEAKER_01: OK.
[0:18:11] SPEAKER_01: So we can say, all right, Vanessa grew up in this hyper intense traumatic household.
[0:18:16] SPEAKER_01: There was a lot of fighting, a lot of pain happening.
[0:18:20] SPEAKER_01: So she developed a coping strategy that decided she was going to solve everybody's problems
[0:18:25] SPEAKER_01: and have no boundaries so she didn't create more conflict.
[0:18:30] SPEAKER_01: But it's not just at a cognitive level.
[0:18:33] SPEAKER_01: It's not just conceptual and it's actually not just behavioral.
[0:18:38] SPEAKER_01: And I think this is the part that can really confound us as empaths.
[0:18:42] Unknown: It's like probably most of you listening are already deep in some personal exploration.
[0:18:49] SPEAKER_01: So you probably got at some point that saying no is like a healthy thing and that you don't
[0:18:55] SPEAKER_01: have to give everything to everybody.
[0:18:59] Unknown: And yet, and yet two things may happen.
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_01: You may still find yourself doing it anyway, despite your better knowing.
[0:19:07] SPEAKER_01: And that's where I think some of these belief systems that are unconscious come in.
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_01: And you may notice that despite your best efforts, you're still absorbing everyone's
[0:19:17] SPEAKER_01: energy, taking on people's feelings, feeling overstimulated, overwhelmed.
[0:19:23] SPEAKER_01: And I think that's because of the energetic component.
[0:19:27] Unknown: Like that's because it's like, I guess we forget that we're energy beings.
[0:19:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, totally.
[0:19:35] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[0:19:36] SPEAKER_01: We forget.
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_01: Like we keep living up in our minds in a way that's like, OK, if I just decide how to behave
[0:19:43] SPEAKER_01: better, things will be different.
[0:19:46] SPEAKER_01: But there was even a point, like I'd be working with clients, I'd do all the management techniques,
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_01: ground my feet, you know, like say a prayer, like give it up to God.
[0:19:57] SPEAKER_01: Put light around you.
[0:19:59] SPEAKER_01: I'd have all of these different techniques.
[0:20:02] SPEAKER_01: And I knew better.
[0:20:03] SPEAKER_01: I knew like it's not my job to fix anyone.
[0:20:05] SPEAKER_01: I'd repeat the mantras, like all of it.
[0:20:08] Unknown: And nevertheless, I'd leave the session feeling what they were feeling.
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_01: And so that was when like when we started to look more into Judas work and I started
[0:20:17] Unknown: to do those meditations, realizing that my coping strategy was not just cognitive, but
[0:20:26] Unknown: that it was energetic and that what I did on a very subtle level was I opened the front
[0:20:34] SPEAKER_01: of my body, I removed like a sense of boundary and skin, and I just kind of merged into
[0:20:39] SPEAKER_01: my ecosystem so that I could really connect with everybody's energy fields, because that's
[0:20:45] SPEAKER_01: the quickest way for me to have picked up on information.
[0:20:47] SPEAKER_01: Right?
[0:20:48] SPEAKER_01: So I could be a first responder to it.
[0:20:51] Unknown: Energetic people have all sorts of different ways.
[0:20:54] Unknown: But I think it's just very, very helpful to understand that these coping strategies are
[0:21:01] Unknown: not just cognitive.
[0:21:04] SPEAKER_01: They're not just conceptual.
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_01: They happen on a physical level.
[0:21:08] SPEAKER_01: They happen where you create constrictions, like we've talked about in other episodes,
[0:21:13] SPEAKER_01: and they happen in the way that you pattern your energy body.
[0:21:18] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:21:19] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:21:20] Unknown: Like the felt experience of the physicality of this and like how you can learn to really
[0:21:30] Unknown: inhabit yourself, which is what the realization process is so good at teaching.
[0:21:37] SPEAKER_00: That makes such a difference.
[0:21:39] SPEAKER_00: And I think I talked about this in a different episode, but my experience with the realization
[0:21:45] SPEAKER_00: process, like let's say in the training week, when I really land in myself, which is becoming
[0:21:50] Unknown: more and more my most of the time for sure, so I can notice it in my ralthing practice.
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_00: I see a bunch of clients every week, so I get a chance to really watch this in action.
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_00: Or I'm a mom with my son.
[0:22:05] SPEAKER_00: Certainly we get really messy with our children, so you can really watch your tendencies there.
[0:22:10] Unknown: But when I'm really in myself, when I'm really inhabiting myself, what I notice is that my
[0:22:19] Unknown: love for the person that I'm with, whether it's a ralthing client or my son or people
[0:22:26] SPEAKER_00: I pass on the street, you know, when we make a little that little moment of eye contact,
[0:22:30] SPEAKER_00: maybe say good morning, maybe not because it's New England.
[0:22:35] SPEAKER_00: But what I notice is that from the space inside of myself, I feel so much, so much love and
[0:22:43] SPEAKER_00: compassion for people from inside myself.
[0:22:47] SPEAKER_00: When I have not been able to be inside of myself, which is the history of most of my
[0:22:51] Unknown: life, what I actually feel is overwhelmed and at the mercy of the world.
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_00: And I feel too much.
[0:23:00] SPEAKER_00: Everything feels like literally sensation too much, all that kind of solar plexus, heart.
[0:23:05] SPEAKER_00: And then I feel like I need to defend.
[0:23:07] SPEAKER_00: And then I feel I notice that I'm kind of doing all the stuff that I've done over the
[0:23:11] SPEAKER_00: years, you know, micro clenching my jaw, micro raising my shoulders, micro tensing my neck,
[0:23:17] SPEAKER_00: at the heart, because my strategy for overwhelm for so many years, unconsciously energetically
[0:23:23] SPEAKER_00: was well then make a barrier.
[0:23:27] SPEAKER_00: And so it's like I was not in my body.
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_00: I was like, I mean, it was, but I was out there overwhelmed by the world and yet creating
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_00: these densities in my body with this idea that it would protect me from the overwhelm.
[0:23:39] SPEAKER_00: But what I find is that the opposite has been completely true.
[0:23:42] SPEAKER_00: When I deeply land in myself, I don't feel the need to constrict.
[0:23:50] SPEAKER_00: And I just feel so in love with the world as opposed to like cold shut down.
[0:23:59] SPEAKER_00: Like I don't need to take care of you.
[0:24:00] SPEAKER_00: You take care of yourself, you know, your business is not my business.
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't feel like that at all.
[0:24:06] SPEAKER_00: Like so much love and respect for people doing their own thing.
[0:24:12] SPEAKER_00: You know, you're Vanessa Ng, guy passing on the street when I walked to the grocery stores
[0:24:18] SPEAKER_00: doing his thing.
[0:24:19] Unknown: I ralphing clients.
[0:24:24] SPEAKER_00: Everyone's just doing their thing.
[0:24:25] Unknown: It's so beautiful from that perspective.
[0:24:29] SPEAKER_01: Sure.
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_01: It's a complete liberation to feel like it's not your business.
[0:24:35] Unknown: And I was thinking while you were talking, so one of our listeners commented on this
[0:24:41] SPEAKER_01: Adi Ashanti quote that I shared at the beginning when I shared it on social media.
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_01: And what they said was totally relating and such a hard thing to change without feeling
[0:24:52] SPEAKER_01: like an uncaring jerk face.
[0:24:54] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:24:55] Unknown: And I think we all go through that as we make this transition.
[0:25:00] SPEAKER_00: And it's the symptom of the fact that there's really active pain bodies at play there which
[0:25:05] SPEAKER_00: say to get love, whatever it is for each person, although I don't think our pain bodies are
[0:25:10] SPEAKER_00: so unique, which we've been talking about a lot lately, you know, in order to get love,
[0:25:14] SPEAKER_00: I have to take care of everyone.
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm not worthy of love, so I'm the caretaker.
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_00: The world is overwhelming.
[0:25:21] Unknown: The world is whatever the belief systems are that put it in place in the first place.
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[0:25:28] SPEAKER_01: I was reading through some research and it was Richard Davidson.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: And they were talking about burnout, which is so common for people in the quote unquote
[0:25:41] SPEAKER_01: helping fields, right, in the healthcare and helping fields.
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_01: And they were distinguishing between, there's a term they use called compassion fatigue.
[0:25:50] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of a common term in the psychological world that's examining burnout.
[0:25:55] SPEAKER_01: And they were saying that actually the research is pointing to more of an empathy burnout
[0:26:02] SPEAKER_01: than a compassion fatigue.
[0:26:04] SPEAKER_01: And really what they distinguish is that empathy is this sense of like actual emotional resonance,
[0:26:09] SPEAKER_01: right, like where you feel somebody's feelings.
[0:26:14] SPEAKER_01: In a way, it's kind of, it's hard to distinguish because sometimes they'll use that same kind
[0:26:19] SPEAKER_01: of definition for compassion.
[0:26:21] SPEAKER_01: But what I was sort of taking from it, applying through my own experience with Judith's work
[0:26:27] Unknown: in the meditations and embodiment is that when I can inhabit the space of my own body,
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_01: and as Judith would say, know myself as fundamental consciousness, which is this much more subtle
[0:26:42] SPEAKER_01: vibrational experience than energy.
[0:26:45] SPEAKER_01: And I think we should talk about that.
[0:26:46] SPEAKER_01: I think that might have been confusing last week.
[0:26:48] SPEAKER_01: I got one listeners.
[0:26:49] SPEAKER_01: And the energy episode.
[0:26:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:26:52] SPEAKER_01: So let's circle back to that in a second.
[0:26:53] SPEAKER_01: But when I could know myself and habit my body and kind of feel my spaciousness, right,
[0:27:01] SPEAKER_01: then I can feel and sense other people's feelings.
[0:27:06] SPEAKER_01: Judith would say, see, feel, and that's what it's like.
[0:27:09] SPEAKER_01: It's like see, feel, you don't know how to know how you're feeling it, but you are.
[0:27:13] SPEAKER_01: And yet the difference is you don't feel they're your own so that there's this real
[0:27:18] Unknown: clarity that arises that's like, hmm, this isn't me.
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_01: And with this idea of empathy fatigue, it's like you're resonating in such a way and yet
[0:27:31] SPEAKER_01: you don't have a consciousness like this isn't mine.
[0:27:35] SPEAKER_01: And Adia sort of pointed at that too.
[0:27:38] SPEAKER_01: And and a lot of sensitive people will describe that experience, you know, walking into a
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_01: room, being at a party, talking to a co-worker, talking to their loved one, whatever it is,
[0:27:48] SPEAKER_01: all of a sudden they're feeling anxious or angry or or disappointed.
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_01: And they can't even separate.
[0:27:55] SPEAKER_01: We were talking about this last week, like mine, yours.
[0:27:59] Unknown: They just it's it's almost indistinguishable because they're listening like the pattern
[0:28:06] Unknown: of how they move and exist and listen is is not inhabiting the space of their own body.
[0:28:14] Unknown: It's picking up and kind of merging into the field in a way that makes the field indistinguishable
[0:28:21] Unknown: from you.
[0:28:23] SPEAKER_01: So we have this kind of belief system that to have boundaries is rude.
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_00: I know, especially women get that so much.
[0:28:33] SPEAKER_00: It's so weird.
[0:28:34] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's weird is a mild term for what it is.
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_01: And it's like so we have the obvious level, right, that you're just referring to.
[0:28:42] SPEAKER_01: And then I remember when I was in Bali and I was talking to a teacher and he was somebody
[0:28:51] SPEAKER_01: who worked with energy very intimately and the energy of the land.
[0:28:54] SPEAKER_01: Quite an amazing guy. I've referenced him before.
[0:28:58] SPEAKER_01: And he taught me a lot of energetic boundary techniques, like a lot of these ones that we
[0:29:03] SPEAKER_01: were just describing in Buddhism.
[0:29:05] SPEAKER_01: They'll do a lot of like seeing rainbow colored lights around you and like swirling things.
[0:29:10] SPEAKER_01: I mean, actually, they have very beautiful visualizations for how you create energetic
[0:29:15] SPEAKER_01: boundaries. And he was describing them to me.
[0:29:18] SPEAKER_01: And I remember being like that if I had all of those boundaries around me, how am I supposed
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_01: to feel what's happening with my clients?
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_01: Like, I have to feel it.
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_01: Now, that to me was a very normal statement to make.
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_01: Like, it's my job to feel people's feelings.
[0:29:33] SPEAKER_01: Like, I'm somebody who works with feelings.
[0:29:36] SPEAKER_01: I'm a counselor. Like, I have to feel their feelings.
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_01: And the way that I feel it is by not having boundaries.
[0:29:42] SPEAKER_01: I never realized there was a problem in that statement.
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: You know, he, of course, did.
[0:29:48] Unknown: And he said from the Buddhist perspective that you set boundaries, you set boundaries,
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_01: you set boundaries until essentially your heart and your mind were so open, so connected
[0:30:02] SPEAKER_01: to oneness that you realized that instead of absorbing, you could radiate and then
[0:30:08] SPEAKER_01: you didn't need to anymore.
[0:30:09] SPEAKER_00: So isn't that interesting?
[0:30:10] SPEAKER_01: But it's another more fancy description of fundamental consciousness, because was fundamental
[0:30:16] SPEAKER_01: consciousness when you're inhabiting the space of your body, you radiate from your
[0:30:20] SPEAKER_01: core, not like you don't radiate by opening up your guts and like pouring your light out
[0:30:26] SPEAKER_01: into the world.
[0:30:27] Unknown: Right.
[0:30:28] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:30:29] Unknown: It's a different thing.
[0:30:30] SPEAKER_01: Who knew that what I was saying was wrong?
[0:30:33] SPEAKER_01: A, I didn't understand that I could feel, I could see, feel what was happening in others.
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: I could have a point of empathy and still stay within myself and still exist and have
[0:30:46] Unknown: skin and have a boundary.
[0:30:49] Unknown: And I was so wired for this kind of sacrificial opening up to the world so that I can like
[0:30:59] SPEAKER_01: be more effective quote unquote, because I can like really know what's happening to them
[0:31:04] SPEAKER_01: and really empathize with them.
[0:31:07] SPEAKER_01: I didn't even realize that it's a bit of a martyr pattern, that it's like, let me open
[0:31:13] SPEAKER_01: up my veins and give it to you.
[0:31:16] Unknown: Yep.
[0:31:17] Unknown: As I'm listening to you, I'm thinking that maybe we've come at this from two different
[0:31:22] SPEAKER_00: places.
[0:31:23] SPEAKER_00: There's lots of similarities as we both know, because we've known each other a long time,
[0:31:26] Unknown: but yours is more of the sacrificial, like go out, open the veins kind of thing.
[0:31:35] Unknown: And mine is almost more like this, like I picture a little periscope coming out of the
[0:31:40] SPEAKER_00: water and like going out and scanning for safety while barricading the fortress.
[0:31:47] SPEAKER_00: Like I've become the more density person that's been historically my pattern, which is why,
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_00: you know, I'm a rolfer.
[0:31:54] SPEAKER_00: Like I needed somebody to figure out how to take the armor off literally, because I was
[0:32:00] SPEAKER_00: very, very, very armored.
[0:32:03] SPEAKER_00: And it was this year that I can't remember how it came to me.
[0:32:08] SPEAKER_00: It kind of came in dribbles and all different moments.
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't some big like, aha, instantaneous thing, but that so with the work we've been
[0:32:17] SPEAKER_00: doing, Dharma Ocean, meditating with the body, Judith Blackstone realization process, and
[0:32:21] Unknown: certainly all of our work with Ciaran Trace.
[0:32:26] SPEAKER_00: I feel more in my body and I'm a pretty big body feeler.
[0:32:30] SPEAKER_00: Like that's not news to me that I can feel sensation in my body, but I could really feel
[0:32:35] SPEAKER_00: my heart and solar plexus, really feel what was going on there in a way that I just hadn't
[0:32:39] SPEAKER_00: tracked before.
[0:32:41] SPEAKER_00: And I could feel the way that I defended it, created densities around it.
[0:32:45] SPEAKER_00: And then I had this experience where it's like I could feel stuff, like you're talking
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_00: about this almost being hijacked by your environment, feeling other people's stuff
[0:32:53] SPEAKER_00: kind of coming at me.
[0:32:54] SPEAKER_00: And I could watch me defend by doing my normal dance of like restricting and constricting
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_00: and building up armoring.
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_00: And then I realized, oh, it hurts.
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_00: It hurts when it comes in and it hits the restriction.
[0:33:08] SPEAKER_00: The thing that hurts is actually the restriction.
[0:33:12] SPEAKER_00: This might sound weird unless people, because it's an experiential thing, but I'm going
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_00: to try talking through it because we have a lot of senses in there who can really feel
[0:33:18] SPEAKER_00: so this might be an experience you have.
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_00: So as I've done the work of letting go of the densities, I still have boundaries.
[0:33:26] SPEAKER_00: I still have skin.
[0:33:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm in my own body, in fact, more so than ever because I'm not evading.
[0:33:35] Unknown: So if something comes in from the environment now, and Judith does with this, with the throwing
[0:33:40] Unknown: a pea, an imaginary energetic pea throwing through, I can have the experience of it just
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_00: goes through like it's not mine.
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_00: I don't have to hold it for them.
[0:33:51] SPEAKER_00: I don't have to defend against it.
[0:33:53] SPEAKER_00: And it was this really wild thing to discover the safest possible place for me to be is
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_00: wide open, not wide open in the spilling out, opening the veins way, but wide open in the
[0:34:05] Unknown: fully inhabiting my body, landed in myself, and I'm not constricting against like that's
[0:34:12] SPEAKER_00: so safe.
[0:34:14] SPEAKER_00: How can I possibly be?
[0:34:15] SPEAKER_00: And you had this too, when we were at the realization process, like, oh, nothing can
[0:34:18] SPEAKER_00: be taken from me.
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_00: Look, I exist.
[0:34:23] SPEAKER_00: I have boundaries.
[0:34:24] SPEAKER_00: I have skin and bones and tissue and cells and the cells have cell walls.
[0:34:29] SPEAKER_00: Like it has so much intelligence to it.
[0:34:32] SPEAKER_00: And these things, emotions, static or whatever in the environment can just go through.
[0:34:39] SPEAKER_00: That sounds a little like all of these things do talking it out loud is a little like, yeah,
[0:34:45] SPEAKER_00: but having a landing in it experience of it is like, wow, especially if you've been
[0:34:50] SPEAKER_00: a defender your whole life and you realize the safest thing in the world is to let go
[0:34:54] Unknown: of the armoring.
[0:34:56] Unknown: Sure.
[0:34:57] SPEAKER_01: Because I've been an evacuator my whole life and I realized the safest thing in the world
[0:35:01] SPEAKER_01: is not to evacuate.
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:35:03] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:35:04] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[0:35:05] SPEAKER_00: It's like, oh, you know, that's that's pretty startling when you live it, when you land
[0:35:09] Unknown: in it.
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_01: I know it's crazy.
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_01: I remember years back, I saw one of my favorite energy workers, her name's Holly Star, and
[0:35:17] SPEAKER_01: I was asking her about this pattern of absorbing because I was teaching at Pacific College
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_01: acupuncturists at the time.
[0:35:24] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of them were absorbing their clients pain and suffering, you know, like a client
[0:35:29] SPEAKER_01: would come in with a knee problem.
[0:35:31] SPEAKER_01: They would leave.
[0:35:32] SPEAKER_01: The practitioner had a knee problem.
[0:35:34] SPEAKER_01: And like this was just happening all the time.
[0:35:36] SPEAKER_01: And I was asking her kind of like, how do you not absorb energy?
[0:35:40] Unknown: Because also I was doing it.
[0:35:43] Unknown: And I remember her saying like, energy is just energy.
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it moves, right?
[0:35:48] SPEAKER_01: Like energy is not a concrete thing.
[0:35:51] SPEAKER_01: It only sticks in you when it's got something to stick to.
[0:35:54] Unknown: Yeah, there's Velcro.
[0:35:58] SPEAKER_01: If there's Velcro, right, which are the belief systems, which are these constrictions, which
[0:36:02] Unknown: are these places where we're still patterning without recognizing that, you know, we're
[0:36:09] SPEAKER_01: God or we're one or that we're fundamental consciousness, if you want to use Judas language
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_01: and that that leaves something to stick to.
[0:36:19] SPEAKER_01: And so energy sticks, right?
[0:36:21] SPEAKER_01: And that the more you have this realization of your essential nature, there's just less
[0:36:28] SPEAKER_01: gluey mess.
[0:36:29] SPEAKER_01: Like, as you said, the restriction was creating the pain.
[0:36:32] SPEAKER_01: It would come in and it would hit you there.
[0:36:34] Unknown: And I thought maybe I can read this little bit by Judith, if you don't mind, because
[0:36:41] SPEAKER_01: maybe it can clarify.
[0:36:43] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[0:36:44] SPEAKER_01: She says, although sensitivity may cause discomfort, it's an entryway into life's spiritual dimension.
[0:36:53] Unknown: Sensitive people sometimes try to make themselves more solid or dense, aka you, or to shut themselves
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_01: off from the onslaught of stimuli in their daily lives.
[0:37:05] SPEAKER_01: However, the cure for this discomfort is to actually become more sensitive and open.
[0:37:12] SPEAKER_01: As you continue to develop your sensitivity, your consciousness can become so refined that
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_01: it is finally the luminous transparency of fundamental consciousness pervading the material
[0:37:24] Unknown: world.
[0:37:25] SPEAKER_01: When this happens, stimuli can move through this dimension of consciousness without disturbing
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_01: As fundamental consciousness, you remain steady and open while the movement of life flows
[0:37:36] Unknown: through you.
[0:37:38] SPEAKER_01: This means that you can continue to become even more subtly attuned to life without being
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_01: overwhelmed by the world around you.
[0:37:46] SPEAKER_01: Attunement to fundamental consciousness also helps you tolerate stimuli in your environment
[0:37:50] SPEAKER_01: because it requires you to inhabit your body.
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_01: When you live within your body, you have a felt sense of internal depth and wholeness.
[0:38:00] SPEAKER_01: You can also feel the qualities of your being, such as love, understanding, and power.
[0:38:06] Unknown: This is an experience of actually existing and possessing yourself from the inside.
[0:38:14] Unknown: This internal depth, wholeness, and quality of being cannot be broken.
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_01: Stimuli move through it without altering it.
[0:38:23] Unknown: As your senses become refined, as you reach the subtle range of your senses, they also
[0:38:28] SPEAKER_01: become unified.
[0:38:30] SPEAKER_01: The vibrational nature of reality that is revealed with your subtle senses is seen,
[0:38:35] SPEAKER_01: heard, touched, smelled, tasted all at once.
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_01: Finally, as you realize yourself as fundamental consciousness, you have a single direct experience
[0:38:44] Unknown: of each moment.
[0:38:47] SPEAKER_01: All sensory stimuli seem to emerge directly out of the pervasive empty spaciousness of
[0:38:51] Unknown: your consciousness without any effort on your part.
[0:38:55] Unknown: This produces the feeling of immediacy or now-ness that's associated with spiritual
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_01: experience.
[0:39:02] Unknown: I love it.
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_01: I know, yum, right?
[0:39:08] SPEAKER_00: For everyone listening, what I would like to say as we're heading towards wrap-up moment
[0:39:12] SPEAKER_00: is that this is because we're the get it right culture.
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I'm doing it wrong and now I'm going to get it right.
[0:39:22] SPEAKER_00: That's not what we're saying.
[0:39:24] Unknown: This stuff is so intimately wired into us.
[0:39:28] SPEAKER_00: This arrived, like you said, probably, I think definitely was an aptitude we just showed
[0:39:33] SPEAKER_00: up with.
[0:39:34] Unknown: Then we had an environment where it was required and it became distorted.
[0:39:42] SPEAKER_00: You'll figure it out imperfectly.
[0:39:45] SPEAKER_00: Let yourself figure it out imperfectly.
[0:39:47] SPEAKER_00: I invite you to be willing and if you're tired enough and when you get tired enough, you
[0:39:51] SPEAKER_00: will be willing to see if you can put it down.
[0:39:56] SPEAKER_00: The things that help are what we're talking about, the realization process with Judith
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_00: Blackstone.
[0:40:01] SPEAKER_00: How do you actually land in yourself?
[0:40:03] SPEAKER_00: What is embodiment, which is a word that I'm seeing in my field get ruined, has been ruined,
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_00: doesn't mean anything anymore.
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter.
[0:40:12] SPEAKER_00: The word doesn't matter because what we're talking about is a lived experience that cannot
[0:40:15] SPEAKER_00: be labeled.
[0:40:16] SPEAKER_00: That's a great resource.
[0:40:19] SPEAKER_00: cognitive ideas, just questioning, is it true?
[0:40:23] SPEAKER_00: Is it true that I'm a bad person if I'm not the helper?
[0:40:27] Unknown: Is it true that it's rude to say no?
[0:40:32] SPEAKER_00: Byron Katie, I think, does a really good job in her book.
[0:40:35] SPEAKER_00: I can't remember which one, but she just talks about whose business in it is it?
[0:40:39] SPEAKER_00: She says there's only three kinds of business in the world, my business, other people's
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_00: business and God's business.
[0:40:45] SPEAKER_00: I think what Byron Katie knows and what she didn't write in her book, she was writing
[0:40:48] SPEAKER_00: it for the population, is that it's all God's business.
[0:40:51] SPEAKER_00: I can tell you that is fucking real true.
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_00: First F-bomb of the episode, by the way.
[0:40:56] SPEAKER_00: Maybe we're maturing.
[0:40:58] SPEAKER_00: Maybe.
[0:40:59] SPEAKER_00: We're so grown up.
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_00: But until you have a lived experience of, oh, it's all God's experience, it's just
[0:41:04] SPEAKER_00: helpful to sift around.
[0:41:06] Unknown: Is it my business?
[0:41:10] SPEAKER_00: You'll be amazed if you're open the floodgates, leave your body, go out, save the world.
[0:41:15] Unknown: You're a real type.
[0:41:17] SPEAKER_00: How little of it is your business?
[0:41:19] SPEAKER_00: And then there might be grief.
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_00: There might be grief for that lost identity and that's okay.
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_00: But these things are worth getting curious about and playing with for a life that just
[0:41:30] Unknown: feels more nourishing and less draining and where you get to actually have this deep communion
[0:41:37] SPEAKER_00: with people in the world that's a lot more profound than running around putting out other
[0:41:42] Unknown: people's and your own fires.
[0:41:46] Unknown: I remember having this moment when I was in therapy 10 years or so ago and I was really
[0:41:55] Unknown: sad and grief stricken over how much I perceived my parents as suffering.
[0:42:02] Unknown: And I remember it feeling really shocking that I couldn't do anything about that.
[0:42:11] SPEAKER_01: That I couldn't fix it somehow or make it better for them, which is quite natural and
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_01: many people feel that way.
[0:42:19] SPEAKER_01: We hate to see people we love suffering and if there was anything we could do, we want
[0:42:23] SPEAKER_01: to do it.
[0:42:25] SPEAKER_01: And I remember really being in pain over it.
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_01: Like, what do you mean there's nothing I can do?
[0:42:29] SPEAKER_01: I mean, like they're suffering, I have to do something, it's what I'm here for, just
[0:42:34] SPEAKER_01: really in the thick of my pain body on it.
[0:42:37] Unknown: And then I had this revelation that like, I don't know, my parents are 30 something
[0:42:43] SPEAKER_01: years older than me.
[0:42:45] SPEAKER_01: They had survived the death of their parents, they had survived the birth of three kids,
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_01: they had survived tough times.
[0:42:52] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, wow, you know what?
[0:42:54] Unknown: There's a way I'm undermining them, you know, in their path.
[0:42:59] SPEAKER_01: And that's not even from a spiritual level, that's just the pure psychology of like humans
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_01: and like, who am I to make their suffering my business?
[0:43:07] SPEAKER_01: Like my parents choose to stay together because family was everything to them.
[0:43:11] SPEAKER_01: That's just a value system and that's their value system.
[0:43:14] SPEAKER_01: And who am I to second guess their value system and say they should have done it differently?
[0:43:19] SPEAKER_01: And then if we got into a more spiritual level, like, who am I to question God?
[0:43:24] SPEAKER_01: And I don't know what they're here for in this lifetime and I don't know, you know what?
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_01: trying to unravel for themselves and should looks painful, but it's not my business.
[0:43:34] SPEAKER_01: You know, I because I can't know and because I can't do right because I can't fix it and
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_01: because I can't understand from that level of mind where I'm struggling to get like an
[0:43:45] SPEAKER_01: answer as to why they're doing what they're doing and then that fix it that solution,
[0:43:50] SPEAKER_01: you know, and I think as we can start to have some of that inquiry that you were describing
[0:43:55] Unknown: book just even till today.
[0:43:58] Unknown: I mean, you all heard me if you've been listening, go through the mold episode and like having
[0:44:04] SPEAKER_01: to leave Florida.
[0:44:05] SPEAKER_01: Even then, I still felt responsible for them suffering.
[0:44:08] SPEAKER_01: That's how thick the issue of enmeshment is in my lifetime, right?
[0:44:14] SPEAKER_01: For me, that I'm so wired to believe it's my job to make other people okay, you know,
[0:44:21] SPEAKER_01: that I'm a total disappointment and selfish prick if I if I disrupt their harmony, right?
[0:44:27] SPEAKER_01: So it's very, very deep and it doesn't just change overnight.
[0:44:30] SPEAKER_01: Like it has softened and softened and softened and it's looser like from that place 10 years
[0:44:37] SPEAKER_01: ago where I was so identified with that belief.
[0:44:40] SPEAKER_01: I couldn't even understand there was another belief.
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_01: Like what is happening?
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_01: What are you saying to me?
[0:44:45] SPEAKER_01: It's not my job.
[0:44:46] SPEAKER_01: Of course, it's my job to now where I can see every movement.
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_01: I have clarity.
[0:44:52] SPEAKER_01: It's not mine.
[0:44:53] Unknown: Yet, there's still patterning and there's still behavioral like unconscious behavior
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_01: and pain body triggers.
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_01: So a lot of softness, a lot of recognizing that these things don't tend to just dissolve
[0:45:09] SPEAKER_01: like overnight.
[0:45:11] SPEAKER_01: soften and soften and lighten and and and brighten and and unwind, you know, in this
[0:45:17] Unknown: beautiful pattern.
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_01: And then as you said, I guess, you know, sometimes it must be frustrating when you listen to
[0:45:24] SPEAKER_01: us and you're like, Okay, but what's the answer?
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_01: And we did point you in the direction of a couple of things.
[0:45:30] SPEAKER_01: Maybe Brooke, you and I can, if people are interested, lead a Judith Blackstone meditation,
[0:45:35] SPEAKER_01: just one so people can know what that's like.
[0:45:38] SPEAKER_01: So if you're interested, you can give us a little nod to that on social media or email
[0:45:44] SPEAKER_01: us or whatever it dear bliss and grit.
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_01: No dear at bliss and grit.
[0:45:49] SPEAKER_01: But but in a way, kind of to me, the main point, since this is such a journey, and you
[0:45:56] SPEAKER_01: need to find your teachers and your path and your way with it, was to tell you that there's
[0:46:01] SPEAKER_01: hope that you don't have to spend the rest of your life managing.
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: And using all of your attention and your energy on how to stay safe and stay okay,
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_01: that a you could just make your life circumstances better.
[0:46:16] SPEAKER_01: Like the way I shared the story once, like I was telling Kieran how my sensitivity was
[0:46:21] SPEAKER_01: like two sides of a coin, and it was a gift, but it came baked in with all these challenges.
[0:46:25] SPEAKER_01: And she was like, Yeah, that's because you think it's a problem.
[0:46:28] SPEAKER_01: So you don't align your life around who you are.
[0:46:31] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, Oh, I didn't see that underpinning.
[0:46:34] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:46:35] SPEAKER_01: So but that is intelligent, right?
[0:46:37] SPEAKER_01: Like, you know, if you live in the middle of New York City, and you're sensitive, and
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_01: you work on a trading floor, like, guess what?
[0:46:43] SPEAKER_00: You're gonna flame out.
[0:46:44] SPEAKER_01: You're gonna have a lot of problems.
[0:46:47] SPEAKER_01: But take that same person and, you know, put them in like a pastoral setting in like, Southern
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_01: California and let them work from home as an entrepreneur, and they're probably gonna
[0:46:58] SPEAKER_01: have a different experience of themselves in life.
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_01: So there's hope because A, as you recognize you're not pathological, you're beautiful,
[0:47:07] SPEAKER_01: you're divine, you're sacred, and you are as you're meant to be, you can realign your
[0:47:10] Unknown: life in support of yourself.
[0:47:13] Unknown: And then B, as you learn to inhabit your body and exist, these things are less and less
[0:47:22] SPEAKER_01: problematic.
[0:47:23] SPEAKER_01: They really are.
[0:47:24] SPEAKER_01: So mostly, I just wanted to plant some seeds that there's hope that you don't have to spend
[0:47:29] SPEAKER_01: the rest of your life managing.

[0:48:32] SPEAKER_00: approachable and relatable.
