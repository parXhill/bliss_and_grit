[0:00:30] SPEAKER_00: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm Brooke Thomas and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:39] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're having conversations about the awakening spiritual path.
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_00: And what does that even mean? What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything? The beauty and the crazy, the joys and the messes,
[0:00:52] SPEAKER_00: the bliss and the grit that is a human life.
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_00: Today, we are talking about the rules that we may have made for our lives at some point,
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_00: which gave us a frame of reference for how to navigate life in a sane and mature way.
[0:01:04] SPEAKER_00: And those moments in life when we are asked to figure out if those rules are to be followed
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_00: to the letter or if a more subtle discernment is called for.
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_00: How do our rules initially help us to be reborn?
[0:01:17] SPEAKER_00: And how can they keep us in needlessly small lives sometimes?
[0:01:21] SPEAKER_00: Most importantly, how do we figure out the difference and learn how to trust ourselves
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_00: when life is requiring that we make decisions that go against any of the rules that we made for
[0:01:33] SPEAKER_00: ourselves? If you're enjoying the show, there are a few ways you can help support us.

[0:02:16] SPEAKER_00: Last thing before we head into the conversation, we do curse and this episode was a particularly
[0:02:21] Unknown: sweary one. So if you need headphones to listen, you should go grab them. Okay, here we go.
[0:02:38] Unknown: Hello, Vanessa. Hello, Brooke.
[0:02:50] SPEAKER_00: I would like to talk about rules that we make for ourselves and when life
[0:02:58] SPEAKER_00: forces our hand in needing to off road from those rules a little bit.
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_00: Forces our hand. Forces our hand. And it's like time to really test out whether or not those rules
[0:03:10] Unknown: are true. So this is coming from a personal experience. So I guess I just want to say to
[0:03:19] Unknown: start that there are that all of us, let's say, there's a high probability that all of us have
[0:03:28] SPEAKER_00: done something in our lives where we felt like, wow, I really fucked up. It could be something
[0:03:33] SPEAKER_00: like, wow, I really flunking out of algebra in high school and it really landed in us as like,
[0:03:38] Unknown: I really fucked up. I'm going to swear a lot in this episode. We weren't kidding when we said,
[0:03:44] Unknown: wear headphones. Apparently. Or it could be some of the more challenging patterns. So
[0:03:55] SPEAKER_00: I'm a sober person, people who are in recovery, that one can be in there really strongly.
[0:04:02] SPEAKER_00: And somebody who's maybe dealt with mental illness, there can be and like, wow,
[0:04:09] Unknown: even though we know that these things are from a rational perspective, not our fault, right? It
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_00: can be interpreted by the separate self as like, wow, I really, I really screwed up my life. And so
[0:04:23] SPEAKER_00: one of the adaptive things that we do is we make spoken or unspoken rules or we participate in
[0:04:31] SPEAKER_00: communities that have rules which are intended to help us have like an external guidance system
[0:04:38] SPEAKER_00: frame. And these things can be incredibly helpful. So as usual, none of these conversations are to
[0:04:44] Unknown: like throw one thing out and say the good thing is over here. So in my case, some of my rules
[0:04:55] SPEAKER_00: have come from pretty strongly like the Al-Anon community and adult children of alcoholics. I
[0:04:59] SPEAKER_00: found it very, very helpful to learn that work and to learn about what codependency is and how
[0:05:05] Unknown: it plays in people who would call themselves a member of these teams. And one, you know,
[0:05:13] Unknown: a lot of it, not surprisingly, is about spiritual or not spiritual, emotional sobriety. Like, how do
[0:05:22] Unknown: we not become addicted to excitement? How do we not run away from whatever's going on and off to
[0:05:32] SPEAKER_00: the thing that's going to magically save us? What are the rules of being a sober and by sober, I
[0:05:41] SPEAKER_00: mean, you know, technically of substances, but also emotionally sober adult in the world? How do
[0:05:46] Unknown: we adult? What are the rules of adulting? And those have been tremendously helpful for me.
[0:05:54] SPEAKER_00: And then those of us here, people who have these kinds of conversations about being on this,
[0:06:00] SPEAKER_00: the unfolding path, whatever you want to call it, there is a place and there are several places in
[0:06:07] Unknown: our lives where we're actually life being our spiritual teacher, life brings us circumstances
[0:06:15] Unknown: that requires that we have to go, Oh, do the rules apply the rules that I've used to keep myself
[0:06:24] SPEAKER_00: safe, to make sure that I make safe, sane, nourishing choices? Do they really apply?
[0:06:31] Unknown: Okay. As you might expect, I'm up against one of those places now. And those places usually
[0:06:39] SPEAKER_00: require that there's a decision or there's some action, which is what makes it scary,
[0:06:43] SPEAKER_00: because it brings up that narrative of, Ooh, Ooh, I don't know what to do. And I really hope
[0:06:49] Unknown: I don't fuck it up. So what are the rules? So I can be safe, not make a mistake. And some of us
[0:06:57] SPEAKER_00: really deep inside of ourselves. If we have recovered, if we've recovered from trauma,
[0:07:01] SPEAKER_00: abuse, mental illness, addiction, this is a strong one to strong narrative and helpful.
[0:07:08] SPEAKER_00: The only trouble is that it also keeps the, I can't trust myself. There's something fundamentally
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_00: off or wrong about me that I can't trust. And so I had better be careful narratives. It keeps all
[0:07:25] Unknown: of those narratives at play. And so actually our lives don't change. You know, we sort of
[0:07:34] Unknown: give ourselves these small, safe lives. And there's a stage for that when we're really tender on
[0:07:41] Unknown: newborn legs and emerging back into life. But if it becomes what we do 100% of the time for the rest
[0:07:49] Unknown: of our time here, life just gets very tiny and it can recreate a lot of the walking on eggshells
[0:08:00] Unknown: patterns that we do, that we had to do externally, maybe we just keep careful, careful,
[0:08:09] SPEAKER_00: careful, careful. What are the rules? So for me right now, it's, it's this wonderful
[0:08:15] Unknown: tapestry of things, all of which are super positive and enjoyable, but they're all woven
[0:08:20] Unknown: together in this way of like a lot is all the stuff that I hold most dear is relying on this.
[0:08:27] SPEAKER_00: Will I be able to earn a living? Am I being a good parent? Am I doing what's best for my kid? Am I
[0:08:31] Unknown: doing the smart thing for me? All of that gets woven in where is home? Where do I live? And it's
[0:08:37] SPEAKER_00: because of the school community, which I mentioned before, I won't bother going into all the details,
[0:08:42] SPEAKER_00: but the ways that for me it's, it's woven all together. It's like, okay, it's a perfect match,
[0:08:48] Unknown: but it's not the norm. It's like outside the box. It's a homeschool cooperative. So it's not like
[0:08:55] SPEAKER_00: picking a public school or picking a private school. It's off roading and it requires a long
[0:09:02] SPEAKER_00: commute. It means I would be coworking on site, which means I have to trust my digital work more
[0:09:07] SPEAKER_00: than my in-person rolfing work, which means, which means everything's woven into it. Now, my rules say
[0:09:14] SPEAKER_00: don't go off roading because magical thinking has gotten you into quite the mess more than
[0:09:23] SPEAKER_00: twice. And it says if it's complicated, which in this case I'm thinking about the commute,
[0:09:31] Unknown: that's a hallmark that you're fucking up. It should be simple. It should be available
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_00: and it should be right up close. Now, in my experience, that's true. When something really
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_00: arrives that is straightforward and let's say in alignment and feels like flow, that is a hallmark
[0:09:48] SPEAKER_00: of something I can trust. But this time life was like, let's get down to the real subtle layers here
[0:09:55] Unknown: with all of the ways that not choosing that, what it means for the, what the other choice is, is just
[0:10:02] SPEAKER_00: putting me into this delightful little corner where it's like, you're going to have to really look
[0:10:06] Unknown: at all your rules and look at what's really true here internally for me. And here's the scary part,
[0:10:16] SPEAKER_00: actually choose from that place. There's no not choosing. For example, my son's school ends after
[0:10:24] SPEAKER_00: this year. He's going somewhere different next year. He can't just keep going where he's going.
[0:10:30] Unknown: My work life is shifting and changing. I could put my head in the sand and just do what I've done
[0:10:36] SPEAKER_00: for the last 20 years, but it's actually carrying me along in its momentum. So anyway,
[0:10:41] SPEAKER_00: I know I'm not alone here. I know that a lot of the people who listen to this show
[0:10:46] SPEAKER_00: have recovered from something, even if it was feeling like you made a poor choice at some point.
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_00: And what do we do when we have to choose outside of the very comfortable frame of our
[0:11:02] Unknown: rules for operating in safety in our lives? I love this. Actually, as you were speaking,
[0:11:11] SPEAKER_01: so many examples came into my head of moments where I was in the same position that were even more,
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_01: um, well, one of them very simple and straightforward, and then one of them not so much.
[0:11:24] SPEAKER_01: So, but what occurred to me is that this isn't just in cases of trauma and mental illness
[0:11:33] SPEAKER_01: and sobriety and things like that, that this is probably a fairly run of the mill condition,
[0:11:39] Unknown: because the ego protective mechanism is one that wants to stay safe. And in that journey,
[0:11:48] Unknown: innocently keeps trying to predict safety. And how else could we predict safety,
[0:11:56] SPEAKER_01: but creating rules and like we spoke about in the basic trust episode,
[0:12:02] Unknown: if there was a rupture of trust, trust in the synchronicity and flow of life,
[0:12:08] SPEAKER_01: trust that you're a soul who's here on an awakening journey and everything is here for
[0:12:13] SPEAKER_01: your evolution, trust in yourself. If there was that kind of rupture, which is basically the case
[0:12:20] Unknown: for most of us, and essentially why we're living from our ego personality so much, then you're going
[0:12:29] Unknown: to try to come up with predictive mechanisms and then tools to support that. We're in this case,
[0:12:36] Unknown: rules. So it's almost like a conversation we've had before on management versus transformation,
[0:12:43] Unknown: though, is at some point we have to take action, right? It's not enough to sit in our rooms and
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_01: meditate. And in fact, almost like what you described, Brooke, if we were to hold is true
[0:12:57] SPEAKER_01: that we're here to evolve the souls, life won't let us get away with that anyway.
[0:13:02] SPEAKER_00: Right. Life doesn't want us to be the placid ones sitting on a lotus leaf. That's not the goal.
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: Never makes a decision and never challenges their concepts and never pushes up against with
[0:13:13] SPEAKER_01: friction their ego personality, right? So that doesn't even work. And you get into a circumstance
[0:13:19] Unknown: like you described where it's almost like, I have to make a hard choice, right? I can't not make a
[0:13:25] SPEAKER_01: choice. My son is graduating from school. There is a choice to be made. The only question is,
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_01: which way will I choose? So at a certain point, we have to unfreeze and take action. And yet we
[0:13:38] SPEAKER_01: can have all of these rules. So I'm going to share two examples, one really quick. This one's going
[0:13:44] Unknown: to be so silly sounding, but I was a notorious overeater in my life. I'm not saying I'm recovered.
[0:13:53] SPEAKER_01: I still probably lean in that direction, but it was quite outside of my control at an earlier
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_01: point in life. So I used to have to make rules for myself. Like if I had sugar one day because
[0:14:05] SPEAKER_01: it didn't agree with me, I could not have it the next day because I would spiral into a cycle.
[0:14:11] SPEAKER_01: If I, I couldn't eat pasta, I couldn't even eat starches for a little while because if I had one
[0:14:16] SPEAKER_01: bowl of pasta, I had to have two bowls of pasta. So I would just create rules to protect myself,
[0:14:22] SPEAKER_01: right? Because the consequences of me eating sugar every day were, were quite uncomfortable
[0:14:29] SPEAKER_01: in my life. They created a bit of dysfunction and the consequences of me eating two bowls of pasta
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_01: when I was like absolutely stuffed was something I didn't want to live with. So in the beginning
[0:14:40] Unknown: stage, I just created all these rules. And then of course, what happens over time is we start to gain
[0:14:48] Unknown: more resilience. We start to gain more fluidity. And then there are no rules. There is just what's
[0:14:58] Unknown: true in this present moment. In an area like eating for me, because it wasn't really such a
[0:15:04] SPEAKER_01: big deal, that happened quite fluidly for other people in eating. It may be a much more difficult
[0:15:09] Unknown: process, but here was the kicker example for me in my life. And I've told this story before, but
[0:15:16] Unknown: it might've been a long time ago. So let me refresh your memories. When I got divorced
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_01: from my ex-husband, in our divorce conversations, if any of you have ever been divorced, you know,
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_01: you have the opportunity to have many uncomfortable conversations. And in our divorce conversations,
[0:15:37] SPEAKER_01: he made an illusion to not really ever having wanted to get married. And that
[0:15:45] Unknown: was my desire to get married that had prompted it. And the insinuation that I got out of it
[0:15:53] SPEAKER_01: was I had pushed him into marriage and it didn't go well. Okay, I go on to have another relationship
[0:16:01] Unknown: and in that next relationship, I want to get married. He doesn't. Yet, which is the worst
[0:16:11] Unknown: case scenario, right? Like not just, I don't want to get married. No, just not yet. So I get to decide
[0:16:21] Unknown: how long should I sit around and wait for this? I chose to break up with him and I had this very
[0:16:27] Unknown: clear vision of I didn't want to drag someone down the aisle. Okay. So along comes my beloved,
[0:16:37] SPEAKER_01: my current husband, Mario. And we meet, we start dating. Mario was also divorced much more recently
[0:16:45] Unknown: than I was. I had had years between my divorce when we started dating. And lo and behold,
[0:16:53] SPEAKER_01: after going through an uncomfortable divorce himself, he's like, I don't think I want to
[0:16:58] Unknown: get married. And I'm like, Oh no, because at the time the rule in my head created by my
[0:17:08] SPEAKER_01: ego protective mechanism to stay safe was I don't want to be with anyone who doesn't want to get
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_01: married period. And that will save me from that whole uncomfortable mess. I will just
[0:17:23] Unknown: avoid all circumstances that look, feel, and smell like this. So we hit a crossroads where,
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_01: in our conversations where I did, I don't know why marriage means so much to me, PS by the way,
[0:17:38] SPEAKER_01: in case any of you were wondering that, but it does. And he was less inclined and we were having
[0:17:46] SPEAKER_01: conversations. And ultimately he was like, if I was going to marry anyone, it would be you. I want
[0:17:51] Unknown: to marry you. And I'm like, Oh, what am I going to do here? Because my rule was don't get involved
[0:18:00] Unknown: with someone who's not equally or more on that page than you. But in reality, if I was in contact
[0:18:09] Unknown: with the very moment and the relationship I was in, it was the best, most loving relationship of my
[0:18:18] SPEAKER_01: life. And in reality, Mario is very different than any other man I've been with as each person is
[0:18:26] Unknown: different from themselves. But that tenor of holding someone responsible doesn't exist in him.
[0:18:35] SPEAKER_01: And so as I kept slowing down and being with this, I was at that crossroads you're talking about,
[0:18:42] Unknown: well, either I'm going to hold on to my rules and then I'm guaranteed to be safe,
[0:18:50] Unknown: at least from him doing this to me, or I'm going to trust what my gut is saying based on what I can
[0:18:59] Unknown: observe in the present. And I'm going to proceed in relationship with him. And that was a really
[0:19:07] Unknown: scary choice. Because what if I was wrong? What if I misread him, I misread us, and one day,
[0:19:18] SPEAKER_01: five years down the line or so he was like, you made me marry you, and I didn't want to be married,
[0:19:24] Unknown: or he just wasn't enjoying being in a partnership like that. What if? And then it's like almost like
[0:19:31] SPEAKER_01: because you're breaking your own rule, not only do you have the pain that comes with whatever that
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_01: loss or disappointment is, but you have the pain that comes with thinking you're a fool.
[0:19:44] Unknown: Like you should have seen it. There's this humiliation, shame on top of it.
[0:19:47] Unknown: Yes, the humiliation. You should have seen it and you didn't. And so I went for it. And that was a
[0:19:57] Unknown: big breaking of a rule. I certainly don't regret it. If it falls apart and he blames me for it,
[0:20:05] SPEAKER_01: well, I'll tell you all. We'll do a whole episode on it. It'll be great.
[0:20:11] SPEAKER_01: But it was just that same moment where I realized, and I realized this when working with clients,
[0:20:19] SPEAKER_01: people will have rules. Maybe they got their heart broken once because they called someone
[0:20:24] SPEAKER_01: too much. So then they come up with a rule. I'm never going to call anyone again,
[0:20:28] SPEAKER_01: or I'm never going to call more than once a week. And it's like, yeah, but for the right person,
[0:20:32] Unknown: you can't call too much. Or they think I moved too fast last time. So this time I'm going to go slow.
[0:20:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to date him for five years before we move in together.
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes relationships are just magic and they move really fast. So how do we break out of that
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_01: dogmatic structure of the ego personality that in innocence is like, I just want to stay safe.
[0:20:56] SPEAKER_01: Here's the rules on how to be more in a present alive relationship with life.
[0:21:03] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I always love when we're about, I don't know, 20 minutes into a conversation and I realize,
[0:21:09] SPEAKER_00: oh, we're having a conversation about classical spiritual themes here. So we're talking about
[0:21:15] Unknown: a leap of faith. We're talking about pretty radical self-love and self-forgiveness
[0:21:22] SPEAKER_00: because we have to be able to forgive the one who fucked up in the first place.
[0:21:28] Unknown: And the radical self-love is like, what if you're just living the life that you're supposed to live
[0:21:35] Unknown: as opposed to I screwed it up. I should have, I shouldn't have. But yes, at some point we're
[0:21:42] Unknown: up against this, this leap of faith where we have to go against our rules. And the only reason why
[0:21:50] Unknown: we would do that is because there's something else nudging us internally. There's something
[0:21:58] Unknown: from the deeper being from our soul. That's like, it's like tapping on us. You don't have to pay
[0:22:08] Unknown: attention to me here. I'm going to put you right in a circumstance where you have to act or make
[0:22:16] SPEAKER_00: some decision and it's going to break a rule. And I'm not talking about that kind of reckless,
[0:22:22] SPEAKER_00: like I said, I wouldn't go out partying for three days ever again, but I'm doing it.
[0:22:27] SPEAKER_00: You know, like we're talking about that moment when life goes along its path and,
[0:22:33] SPEAKER_00: and there's the fork in the road, right? And we have to decide which,
[0:22:37] SPEAKER_00: which route are we going to take something that really isn't about a temporary moment of pleasure,
[0:22:42] SPEAKER_00: which would be the addictive impulse, but something that's about like,
[0:22:46] Unknown: what's, what's in my best interest for my life? If I'm a good shepherd to this one,
[0:22:55] SPEAKER_00: and I'm here for me, and I want this one to have a good experience of life.
[0:22:59] Unknown: Ooh, like I used to have a compass called, called don't break your rules. Here they are.
[0:23:06] Unknown: Now I have to get acquainted with this, this more intimate compass
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_00: called life or our soul that's trying to participate in
[0:23:19] Unknown: bringing us to a new, a new place. So it's probably worth talking about because we've all been up
[0:23:26] SPEAKER_00: against these leaps of faith. And I would say we all have a certain amount of shame about how we
[0:23:32] SPEAKER_00: should have done something differently in our lives or should be able to currently do something
[0:23:36] Unknown: differently in our lives. How do we trust to make a choice that goes against the rules for our life?
[0:23:48] SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, the first part is it's difficult because patterns do exist.
[0:23:54] SPEAKER_01: And if a pattern isn't seen, isn't loved, isn't released, then it will keep replicating in your
[0:24:02] SPEAKER_01: life. And it will co-opt the way that you interpret data. It'll co-opt your entire perception.
[0:24:11] Unknown: So that's part of what I think makes it difficult. But at the same time, if we never take action,
[0:24:20] SPEAKER_01: if we never experiment, this is what my intuition felt like. This is where my heart's telling me to
[0:24:27] SPEAKER_01: go. I'm going to take this step and then I'm going to see, I'm going to see, was it a pattern?
[0:24:32] SPEAKER_01: Was it my soul? Like, I'm going to see and I'm going to learn and I'm going to adapt all of those
[0:24:37] SPEAKER_01: things. And I'm going to trust in my resilience. If you don't do that, you're just a victim of your
[0:24:45] SPEAKER_01: own conditioning, right? Then you're just stuck in freeze mode, which has so many consequences to it.
[0:24:51] SPEAKER_01: So I think, you know, it's a little different. It's a little difficult. And one of the things
[0:24:57] Unknown: I'd like to add to the conversation is external orientation versus internal orientation.
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_01: And so yesterday I went to a workshop with a teacher named Dr. Sue Mordor. We'll put her on
[0:25:13] SPEAKER_01: the website in the show notes. And I'm probably going to butcher her concept a little bit, but I
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_01: want to read a quote because what I think is interesting is the mind is always looking externally.
[0:25:26] Unknown: It's looking at cues and its environment to make its choices and to determine who it is.
[0:25:34] Unknown: In that case, you could imagine that we're looking at our circumstances. Does this circumstance look
[0:25:42] SPEAKER_01: safe or unsafe? Does it look desirable or undesirable? But our focus, our energy is outward.
[0:25:49] Unknown: Now that's not a position we can get intuition from, right? Because the mind is what's doing that.
[0:25:57] SPEAKER_01: It's looking outward. And if you imagine yourself really pondering a situation or a circumstance
[0:26:05] SPEAKER_01: and a choice, you could imagine how easy it is, almost like you're putting your energy on that.
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_01: Like it's leaving your body and like going to it. You can see how externally you're orienting,
[0:26:17] Unknown: which is just what the mind does. It's what the ego safety mechanism does. Is it scans the
[0:26:24] Unknown: environment for clues and if everything's going well. But that's not a way to get intuition.
[0:26:32] SPEAKER_01: That's the mind leading the choices. And since the mind is often the aspect of us that is the
[0:26:38] SPEAKER_01: most conditioned and the most wired to safety, especially the primal brain, we need to be
[0:26:46] SPEAKER_01: accessing the creative aspects of our being. The higher brain, the intuition and the gut wisdom
[0:26:54] SPEAKER_01: that we possess. So then that requires us learning how to have an internal orientation,
[0:27:02] SPEAKER_01: to be aware of the sensations in our body, to be aware of the energy in our body,
[0:27:08] SPEAKER_01: to be aware of where our constrictions are and where our releases are. And I think as we do that,
[0:27:16] SPEAKER_01: we get more sense of our wholeness, we get more sense of our resilience, but we also then can begin
[0:27:23] SPEAKER_01: to trust and play with what's coming through. I think in a way that's more viable than if we're
[0:27:31] SPEAKER_01: constantly just looking at the factors and all of the external circumstances. And my friend,
[0:27:38] SPEAKER_01: Jane said, but Dick said, and then Sue said, if we're in that mode, I'm not sure we should
[0:27:45] SPEAKER_01: trust its intuition and not just the same pattern if it looks the same.
[0:27:50] SPEAKER_00: That's so funny because one of the phrases that keeps running through my head right now
[0:27:56] SPEAKER_00: is I'm not making any decisions by committee.
[0:28:01] SPEAKER_00: It just keeps coming to me because I'm also, as you know, Vanessa,
[0:28:05] SPEAKER_00: house hunting some. And so there's just all these decisions, office hunting again,
[0:28:10] SPEAKER_00: just all this shit came up again with like all this timing to be like, here's a chance.
[0:28:15] SPEAKER_01: Something about your life where you always have to make it all at once.
[0:28:17] Unknown: I know, I know. I think it's a personality thing of like being a little wired for intensity.
[0:28:26] SPEAKER_00: But that there's this, oh shoot, I totally lost my train of thought. Oh yeah, I'm not making
[0:28:32] Unknown: these decisions by committee. It has been such a relieving thought. And what you're pointing out
[0:28:38] Unknown: is like a part of the relief is I trust me. This is me. This is my life. This is all on me. And
[0:28:46] SPEAKER_00: there's no input, no matter how much I might love literally everyone on the committee,
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_00: who I would bring on the committee, it doesn't matter. Like I have one dear friend who
[0:28:57] SPEAKER_00: asked if she could come house hunting with me this week when I go out and I was like, no,
[0:29:02] SPEAKER_00: I don't want anyone else there. I just want it to be me. I want to know it's coming for me.
[0:29:07] SPEAKER_00: And so sometimes we need to kind of quiet the external noise, whether it's the committee is
[0:29:13] Unknown: one of the external noise and just be like, I trust me. So I needed to be a little quieter out
[0:29:18] SPEAKER_00: here. I don't need everyone to be giving me their advice about what choice to make or what they
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_00: think this looks like or what patterns they might be seeing. I mean, we have enough neurological
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_00: noise. I know we don't need everyone else's opinion because they're just pulling it through
[0:29:32] SPEAKER_00: their filters too, right? You know, like everyone's just putting it through their lens of seeing.
[0:29:38] Unknown: Yeah. And then the other one is to acknowledge that the, the projecting out the external
[0:29:48] Unknown: orientation, it can only be what the separate self does, which is past projected onto the future.
[0:29:56] SPEAKER_00: We've said it a million times, but it's worth always reiterating that, that it only has what
[0:30:02] SPEAKER_00: life used to look like, what happened in the past. And it's safe if you just go, ah,
[0:30:08] Unknown: that's the template. Got it. Take the template, cut and paste, copy it projected over there on
[0:30:14] SPEAKER_00: the future. And now you're safe, but you're actually just pulling the past forward all the time
[0:30:20] SPEAKER_00: when you do that. So the place that the present tense exists, the place where a new thing can
[0:30:24] Unknown: arrive, a new decision, a new orientation towards something really can be with our internal sense,
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_00: our internal sense of knowing. And I'm not saying that this stuff is easier or that we're going to
[0:30:39] SPEAKER_00: do this episode and be like, here's the process, right? Because what we're talking about is what
[0:30:43] Unknown: you and I do one-on-one coaching sessions with people for. It's what we talk about in every
[0:30:48] SPEAKER_00: episode here. It's basically- And it's why we meditate. Yeah, it's why we are on the path. It's
[0:30:54] Unknown: journey to awaken to ourselves as inherently trustworthy and safe and knowing and in relationship
[0:31:08] Unknown: with life. It's not like a, here's the five steps, but just having that frame as context,
[0:31:16] SPEAKER_00: right? Like that's the journey I'm on. And so there will come times where life presents me
[0:31:22] Unknown: with an opportunity, just a little pop quiz to say, like, am I using the external orientation
[0:31:31] Unknown: response, whether it's pulling in other people's opinions or taking the past, projecting it on the
[0:31:36] SPEAKER_00: future, or is there a way that I can use all this stuff that I'm doing when I'm spiritually
[0:31:44] SPEAKER_00: in. Meditating, doing embodiment practices, doing inquiry practices. Can we start to really
[0:31:54] Unknown: trust that those are sturdier legs that we can stand on when we're being given an opportunity
[0:32:01] Unknown: to make a decision from a new point of view and then bring those things in?
[0:32:07] Unknown: Ultimately, that's resilience, right? And that is something that from a psychological point of view,
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_01: even from a basic trust point of view, it's like knowing the well runs deep. Whatever happens,
[0:32:21] SPEAKER_01: however this turns out, I will be able to rise to the occasion and there's an invitation in this
[0:32:29] SPEAKER_01: for me, which is a big deal. And what you were just saying about the external orientation and
[0:32:35] SPEAKER_01: the projection of our conditioning onto it, the other thing that external orientation does
[0:32:41] Unknown: is it's the grabby hands. I need this thing or else. I have to have it or else.
[0:32:48] SPEAKER_00: You need it so that I can finally rest, finally get the reward.
[0:32:53] SPEAKER_01: Then I'll be happy and then I'll be safe and then I'll know my manifestation skills work and then
[0:32:58] SPEAKER_01: I'll know God loves me. And then, so that's one telltale to understand if we're caught in a pattern
[0:33:06] SPEAKER_01: of some sort of any sort, or we could even say if some fear or confusion is riding shotgun here,
[0:33:14] SPEAKER_01: is if it feels like, oh my God, I need this, I need this, I need this dot dot dot, right?
[0:33:22] SPEAKER_01: This sticky grabby hand sensation. And that doesn't mean that the choice that that grabby
[0:33:30] Unknown: hand is leading you to is the wrong choice. What it means is you're going to have to slow down,
[0:33:38] Unknown: get quiet and look at what the attachment is and see if you can soften that attachment
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_01: and work with that misunderstanding that you need anything to be whole and complete that is external
[0:33:54] SPEAKER_01: to you and then come back to your process of making that decision if you can.
[0:34:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think pace is important. You know, what you pointed to about slowing down is really
[0:34:07] SPEAKER_00: critically important. And then the other thing that I have found tremendously helpful in this
[0:34:12] Unknown: is that unbind some of the grabbiness and a ton of the fear is permission to get it wrong.
[0:34:20] Unknown: You know, I would say that the other thing that's really wedded to all this period for me of
[0:34:26] Unknown: transition and some decisions to make is also in there really letting myself be a human being.
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_00: It's so funny how often we like slip away from that, right? Like how easy it is to think that
[0:34:41] Unknown: like the goal and the outcome should be the one who gets it right. The one who has it together.
[0:34:49] Unknown: Because sometimes the consequences suck or so it feels, right? Sometimes they're massive.
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_01: We get pregnant by someone that we then have to be in relationship with on some level the
[0:35:00] SPEAKER_01: rest of our lives or you know, I mean all sorts of things can happen that we can say,
[0:35:07] SPEAKER_01: shit, why did I do that? Because that's how the ego mechanism is seeing it. I am a separate self
[0:35:14] SPEAKER_01: and I made a decision and this is not evolving at all for my benefit and I messed up and life
[0:35:22] Unknown: would have looked different if I chose different. So I understand on a bigger level why it can feel
[0:35:29] Unknown: so scary to make mistakes, you know, quote unquote. And yet there's no perfect way through the game of
[0:35:37] SPEAKER_00: life. No, and this is, you know, we just recently re-aired our basic trust conversation.
[0:35:44] Unknown: All roads do lead to basic trust that things may not go the way you had wanted or hoped. You may
[0:35:54] Unknown: have air quotes really screwed something up and that we're going to have to be called to a place
[0:36:03] Unknown: ultimately where we see that is life painful? Yes. Do painful things happen? Certainly. But can we
[0:36:14] SPEAKER_00: see it through a different lens where we don't spend the rest of our life beating ourselves up
[0:36:19] SPEAKER_00: for the wrong thing that we did? Or we don't spend the rest of our lives angry with God
[0:36:25] Unknown: for the wrong thing that came our way? So we do have to repair that in this conversation too.
[0:36:32] Unknown: But I think that this permission to screw things up is at least a step, a good step,
[0:36:41] SPEAKER_00: in the direction of some surrender into the flow of life, right? Because only the separate self says,
[0:36:46] SPEAKER_00: I am going to stick the landing. You know, I'm going to make this decision perfectly and
[0:36:51] SPEAKER_00: flawlessly and it will only have positive outcomes and all will applaud how I'm the one all along that
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_00: really saw the full picture and got it right. You know, certainly I have had those fantasies
[0:37:05] Unknown: in this decision making that other people for whom this school choice affects that they would
[0:37:09] SPEAKER_00: just be like, wow, you really saw something there that I didn't see. Like, it's not going to happen,
[0:37:15] SPEAKER_00: right? Like the outcome isn't that I'm appreciated for my wonderful decision.
[0:37:21] SPEAKER_00: So and also I don't know, I think there's something so loving and so relieving about,
[0:37:28] Unknown: I honestly don't know that I am going to make the perfect decision. I honestly don't know that
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_00: this will not have downsides. I'm almost certain it will because everything has upsides and
[0:37:41] SPEAKER_00: downsides. It certainly will. There will be aspects of this that are a bummer. There will be aspects
[0:37:46] SPEAKER_00: of the other choice that I could have made that will be a bummer, would have been a bummer. Like
[0:37:52] SPEAKER_00: that's the way it goes. And so the idea of I'm going to pristinely step on new ground,
[0:38:00] SPEAKER_00: free from all conditioning and separate self. And so now I get to live in this space of like,
[0:38:07] Unknown: the one that got it a hundred percent right. It's just fantasy. And I do think that as we go,
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: as we lighten our load, that we do have more and more life experiences that are way
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_00: kinder and more nourishing and more enjoyable. I have experienced that to be true. Absolutely.
[0:38:29] Unknown: But that we don't get out of our humanity ever. Like we're all human beings. We have quirks. We
[0:38:35] Unknown: have histories. We have personalities. And we can't, especially from the level of the separate self,
[0:38:41] Unknown: the mind cannot decide something that's going to go a hundred percent in our favor from now
[0:38:48] SPEAKER_00: until the rest of eternity. Because I really, I followed the rules, the rules about not having
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: rules, right? I slowed down. I listened to my inner self. I used my internal, we can make
[0:38:58] SPEAKER_00: ourselves nuts. And so sometimes just like, huh, lightening it up a little bit. I don't know how
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_00: this is going to go. I don't know. All I know in the case of me, but in the case of anyone that
[0:39:09] SPEAKER_00: finally does act on something that's outside of the frame of what they had decided was acceptable.
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_00: And like you were talking about with you and Mario, all I know is that something deep in me
[0:39:22] SPEAKER_00: is saying yes to this and that something higher up in the area of my forehead is saying, but have
[0:39:30] Unknown: you consulted the rule book? And I'm going to trust that the deep in me sense is the way to go. And
[0:39:39] Unknown: then I'm going to trust fall into life because that's it. That's the only part I get to play
[0:39:43] Unknown: for now. Then it all unfolds and we see. Plus we imagine that we would be good rule followers
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: anyway, which by and large, as we talk about this, I keep thinking about that book, the rules.
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_00: Do you remember? Oh my God, that's right. It was about dating, right? For women, how they had to be.
[0:40:06] SPEAKER_00: Let's just actually write out the rules for female cultural conditioning in the Western world
[0:40:12] SPEAKER_00: and give you the Halloween costume. You're welcome.
[0:40:15] SPEAKER_01: And so many people were into that in case you guys are not familiar with it. It was like
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_01: the rules of dating. I never read the book, so I don't know it well, but it was things like
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: don't text for three days after you date. Don't ask them such and such questions. I mean, it was
[0:40:31] Unknown: basically like had to play hard to get. I didn't read the book either, just being a jerk.
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_01: For fun.
[0:40:40] SPEAKER_01: And I remember being like, this is silly because there's a million ways to relate. There's people
[0:40:46] SPEAKER_01: who had sex on the first date and wind up married and very happy. There's people who didn't have sex
[0:40:52] SPEAKER_01: for six months and have a wonderful, flourishing, intimate relationship. There's people who got
[0:40:58] SPEAKER_01: married after eight weeks, who stay married the rest of their lives and people who got married
[0:41:03] SPEAKER_01: after two years. You should wait and got divorced the year later. There's everything. There's every
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_01: variety. So the idea that you could take any rule book and apply it to every circumstance is already
[0:41:18] SPEAKER_01: just logically flawed. But then to imagine any of us are really good at following rigid parameters,
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_01: don't you notice then you impulsively go out of the rules? And so
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_01: yeah, I won't have any starches until it's Saturday night and then I'm at a friend's house and okay,
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_01: they want pizza and then I have to eat like six slices because now I have to binge because I've
[0:41:41] Unknown: been deprived. Right. Because now I decided the new rule, new rule, I'm out of prison tonight.
[0:41:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Or someone says, I'm going to follow the rules and not text a guy. And then they go have
[0:41:52] SPEAKER_01: a drink or two and they're like, you know, blowing up their phone nonstop. Right? Yeah. So that's the
[0:41:59] SPEAKER_01: other hilarious thing is that we're even necessarily good at rules. Some of them you all should follow
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_00: sobriety, for example. For me, still super glad that every day the choice, I do not use drugs or
[0:42:12] SPEAKER_00: alcohol. It still feels like a hundred percent. Yeah. But it's not just a rule. My deep being is
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_00: also, if I listen to my deep being, it's like, yes, that's yes. That's a yes for you. I think,
[0:42:23] SPEAKER_01: you know, in reality, whenever we make a decision, there's something we're prioritizing.
[0:42:29] Unknown: So the survival mechanism in our brain and in our central nervous system will often prioritize
[0:42:37] Unknown: safety. But then that survivorship, that's not creatorship. If we want to be in a more alive,
[0:42:45] Unknown: awake, evolving process, then we might prioritize something differently. If we are addicted to highs
[0:42:55] Unknown: and intensity, we're obviously going to prioritize differently. And so beginning to get
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_01: some relationship with yourself of like, what are you prioritizing here? And then reflecting,
[0:43:10] SPEAKER_01: does this need to be prioritized right now? Is this for my highest and best good? Because anyone
[0:43:17] SPEAKER_01: who's been through either capital T trauma or little T trauma, as we call it in the psychological,
[0:43:24] SPEAKER_01: developmental trauma in life, whose nervous system got dysregulated by it, or who adopted
[0:43:31] Unknown: beliefs of unworthiness and unsafety, you know, we let our nervous systems do the choosing a lot.
[0:43:41] Unknown: So either we prioritize safety too often over and over again, or then we get sick of prioritizing
[0:43:50] SPEAKER_01: safety. So we're going to go screw it, and then just go completely impulsively and unsafe.
[0:43:57] SPEAKER_01: So then that just reflects to us, okay, there's something that's not regulated here. But the
[0:44:03] SPEAKER_01: answer is not just to keep choosing safety. The answer is to go in and see what's happening here
[0:44:10] SPEAKER_01: that I'm afraid. And how can I bring more love and more compassion to it? Because I think what
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_01: you were saying earlier, Brooke, about making mistakes and being human, and the truth is,
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_01: we're not going to make all perfect decisions in all areas of life. If the qualifier is there's
[0:44:29] Unknown: never any suffering associated with it. Right? Right? Like, if the qualifier is it goes the way
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_00: you had it in your mind's eye when you made the choice, 100% guaranteed. It's not how life goes.
[0:44:41] SPEAKER_01: It's not how life goes. That's just not going to happen for us. So
[0:44:46] SPEAKER_01: if we're going to be on this adventure making bold choices that are outside of our comfort zone,
[0:44:53] SPEAKER_01: I think one of the aspects of being that's super helpful for resilience is self compassion,
[0:45:00] Unknown: and self love, like self kindness. If you can treat yourself with compassion when something
[0:45:06] SPEAKER_01: doesn't go the way you imagined it would, then you can trust that it's okay to make a mistake.
[0:45:15] SPEAKER_01: But if based on your prior conditioning, it's still very rocky terrain for you to have a view
[0:45:23] Unknown: on yourself that is kind, and that is understanding, then it does become really scary
[0:45:31] Unknown: to perceive that you might make a mistake, quote unquote.
[0:45:35] Unknown: Yeah, I was I love I'm going to quote a little little Instagram feed moment. How you like that?
[0:45:42] Unknown: So high classy. You are such a social media.
[0:45:48] SPEAKER_00: I was reading you all followed Brooke, you would know that yeah, once a month, I'm like,
[0:45:52] SPEAKER_00: I underlined this in a book. Here's a leaf. I'm getting it better, I swear. But I I lurk
[0:46:00] SPEAKER_00: plenty. I enjoy other people's feeds and Glennon Doyle, Milton, some of you may know her. She's an
[0:46:05] SPEAKER_00: author and she was she posted something along the lines of some friend said to her like,
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_00: you have screwed up so much in your life. She's also a sober person. How do you
[0:46:21] SPEAKER_00: basically like how do you function? Like how do you get up and just like go do other stuff?
[0:46:27] SPEAKER_00: And Glennon Doyle's response was something along the lines of like at some point,
[0:46:33] SPEAKER_00: I had to get really good at radical self forgiveness. And that just really landed in me like, yeah, you know,
[0:46:42] SPEAKER_00: at some point, we have to find a way to really profoundly not just like, oh, baby,
[0:46:50] SPEAKER_00: we all make mistakes. You're okay. You're you're fine by me. But like,
[0:46:54] Unknown: marrow deep self forgiveness of like, we're all here.
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_00: Lifing, you know, and we're doing it as human beings. And that that is seems to look this way
[0:47:09] Unknown: where we go through all kinds of different things. And how do we really, really bow to ourselves on
[0:47:18] SPEAKER_00: that deep level of like, hey, I see you. And yeah, that hurt and okay.
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_00: Carry on. Like life's different now. Good on you for having awareness and for
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_00: being who you are now. Like the timeline keeps moving.
[0:47:34] SPEAKER_01: I think if you have that orientation, you often don't feel that regret you're worried you'll feel
[0:47:39] SPEAKER_01: like I don't have a lot of regret in my life. And if you wanted to put my life in black and white,
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_01: you could say I made mistakes. You know, someone could look at it through that lens,
[0:47:49] SPEAKER_01: but it doesn't particularly feel that way. I just had a lot of experiences and some of them hurt.
[0:47:55] Unknown: And some of them didn't go the way I imagined. But I don't have a lens of regret that I apply
[0:48:02] Unknown: all too readily. And I think the more we build those muscles of self forgiveness and self
[0:48:09] SPEAKER_01: compassion, the easier it is. You just don't tend to live in the past orientation as readily
[0:48:15] SPEAKER_01: where you're ready to jump on yourself with the attitude of how could you have done this?
[0:48:23] SPEAKER_01: One more thing I wanted to say about external orientation is that can be part of the dilemma
[0:48:29] Unknown: because we have results in mind with the decision. Now, sometimes what if your intuition,
[0:48:37] Unknown: what if your deep intuition says, date this guy who's kind of going to hurt and is not always
[0:48:44] Unknown: going to be emotionally available, because you need to finally flush out and bring to the surface
[0:48:54] SPEAKER_01: this wound of unlovability you've been carrying your whole life that I wish you no longer had to
[0:49:00] Unknown: bear the weight of. So you make a decision from your intuition and then you're in the circumstance
[0:49:09] SPEAKER_01: and it doesn't feel like you imagined in your imagination. It's like your intuition said,
[0:49:15] SPEAKER_01: yes, more. Your imagination said, oh, great. Because it's going to work out.
[0:49:20] SPEAKER_01: Have a beautiful love affair. And then it feels painful. And so then we can say,
[0:49:26] SPEAKER_01: oh, well, maybe I made that decision from the separate self.
[0:49:32] Unknown: But how can we really discern all of that stuff? I mean, I tend to believe that there is a higher
[0:49:40] SPEAKER_01: rhythm to things, that there is a higher cosmic rhythm. I'm still integrating that belief. It's
[0:49:46] Unknown: so little conceptual for me rather than my like owned experience, but I do tend to believe that
[0:49:53] Unknown: way. So I think that's what complicates it. For example, this is a really silly little one,
[0:50:00] SPEAKER_01: but this week I was reading about this woman I shared about earlier, Dr. Sue Mortar. I'd seen
[0:50:06] SPEAKER_01: her name a bunch of times for the last few months because she just published a book and
[0:50:12] SPEAKER_01: she's been shared on other people's feed. No interest whatsoever. In fact, I'd look at her
[0:50:18] Unknown: because people promoted her and then I'm like, meh, you know, nothing. This week, I can't even
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_01: remember what it was that struck my interest, but it like struck it hard. And I'm like, I'm so
[0:50:29] SPEAKER_01: intrigued by this woman. I bought her book right away. I downloaded it. I started reading and I
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_01: thought I really want to study with her. I look online and she's in Austin like four days later.
[0:50:39] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, oh, you know, heaven's opening up and it's giving me this divine synchronicity.
[0:50:46] SPEAKER_01: Because this week I was setting an intention that if there was anything a teacher could offer me,
[0:50:52] Unknown: I would love to have another one come my way. And then, you know, I go to the event and I'm
[0:50:59] SPEAKER_01: totally sick. It's like a half hour drive. I can barely keep my eyes open and function.
[0:51:06] Unknown: And, you know, I'm sick through the event. So which lens was I going to look at it through?
[0:51:13] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I shouldn't have done this. I pushed myself too hard because I had known that this weekend
[0:51:18] SPEAKER_01: after a lot of travel, I would probably be a little more rundown than usual. Or it was a glorious,
[0:51:26] SPEAKER_01: you know, wonderful event in my life. If I have a filter that says all forms of discomfort and
[0:51:35] Unknown: suffering equal, bad, avoid or mistake, I could easily perceive it through that lens.
[0:51:45] SPEAKER_01: But if you have a filter that is geared towards how wonderful, I mean, really the way I thought
[0:51:52] SPEAKER_01: about is, oh, that's interesting. Maybe I'm going there sick and it's because something's going to
[0:51:56] SPEAKER_01: shift in me or what is it? I don't know. Either way, I want to be here. But that filter that looks
[0:52:04] SPEAKER_01: for this is all for my evolution. But if you just looked at all good decisions have to look
[0:52:12] SPEAKER_01: seamless and easy and perfect, you may not recognize that you've been making good decisions.
[0:52:24] SPEAKER_00: And on that note, I'd like to leave everyone with a little inquiry from our friend, Matt Kahn,
[0:52:29] SPEAKER_00: that I use mentally sprinkled throughout my day in moments like this that I find is incredibly
[0:52:33] Unknown: helpful. The inquiry goes a little something like this. What if you're not getting this wrong?
[0:52:42] Unknown: What if you have never gotten this wrong? Sprinkle it through the day and see how the lens starts to
[0:52:49] Unknown: change. Thank you so much for being a part of our community and for listening to today's show.
