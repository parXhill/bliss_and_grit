[0:00:33] SPEAKER_01: I'm Brooke Thomas and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:38] SPEAKER_01: On the show, we're talking about being on the awakening path and what does that actually
[0:00:42] Unknown: mean?
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_01: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_01: How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes,
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_01: the bliss and the grit that is a human life?
[0:00:53] SPEAKER_01: In this episode, we're excited to catch up with each other and to integrate some of what
[0:00:57] SPEAKER_01: we've experienced recently in the presence of so many amazing guest conversations, in
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_01: particular, our recent one with David Thomas.
[0:01:05] SPEAKER_01: We're exploring conditioning again, but after being with David, we're posing the question
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_01: to ourselves, what if it's all conditioning?
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_01: What if, while we're in ego consciousness, all of our thoughts, all of our thoughts,
[0:01:18] SPEAKER_01: are simply products of our culture and lineage that become habitual?
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_01: And if so, what would that mean about how we can shift out of our chronic patterns of suffering?

[0:01:56] Unknown: support for yourself.
[0:01:58] SPEAKER_01: Last thing before we head into the conversation, Vanessa and I do swear, I recall being full-on
[0:02:02] SPEAKER_01: potty mouth this episode here and there, so headphones if you have kids around.
[0:02:08] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:13] SPEAKER_01: Hi Brooke.
[0:02:14] SPEAKER_01: Hey Vanessa.
[0:02:16] SPEAKER_00: So it's been, I don't know, three weeks, four weeks since we've spoken, just the two of us, I think.
[0:02:24] SPEAKER_01: I know, it's lovely.
[0:02:25] SPEAKER_01: It's reunion time.
[0:02:27] SPEAKER_00: I know, it's been a while.
[0:02:28] SPEAKER_00: It's been a beautiful fall.
[0:02:30] SPEAKER_00: We've had so many interesting and powerful guest conversations, I feel like.
[0:02:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and it took us a little by surprise.
[0:02:39] SPEAKER_01: It just all, I mean, we weren't planning on making a marathon of interviews or conversations,
[0:02:43] Unknown: whatever you want to call them, but there's been a lot this fall, so.
[0:02:48] SPEAKER_00: I know, it's crazy actually.
[0:02:49] SPEAKER_00: Going from, let's say, Will Pye talking about how he could experience his brain tumor as
[0:02:55] SPEAKER_00: a blessing to Jeannie's Andy completely rocking and reconfiguring the way that I look at things,
[0:03:05] Unknown: including my own process and our culture, and then into David, which had a profound
[0:03:12] SPEAKER_00: effect on me.
[0:03:13] SPEAKER_00: So there's been a lot, and we thought today, let's just see if we can't integrate in real
[0:03:19] SPEAKER_00: time because I haven't done much integration on my own.
[0:03:24] SPEAKER_00: All right.
[0:03:25] SPEAKER_01: Game on.
[0:03:26] SPEAKER_00: At least certainly not conscious integration, right?
[0:03:28] SPEAKER_00: It's like we sit with these people when something profound shifts inside of you as we're being
[0:03:34] SPEAKER_00: exposed to their fields of energy, their god vibes, as David would say, or as the insights
[0:03:42] SPEAKER_00: are funneling through.
[0:03:43] Unknown: But to sit down consciously and say, hmm, what's up with this for me?
[0:03:51] SPEAKER_00: How am I relating with this is different.
[0:03:53] SPEAKER_00: So I wanted to start to talk about something that's been striking me personally from David's
[0:03:59] Unknown: conversation that we aired last week.
[0:04:05] SPEAKER_00: Let me see how I could put this into words.
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_00: So here's something I took from it.
[0:04:11] SPEAKER_00: And you can correct me if you saw this differently, Brooke.
[0:04:15] SPEAKER_00: But when I walked away out of that conversation, I think I got in a more clear way than ever,
[0:04:21] Unknown: because it's not the first time I'm exposed to this, that every single thought you have,
[0:04:29] Unknown: feeling you have, preference you have, that there's conditioning involved.
[0:04:36] SPEAKER_00: I remember when we went to see Matt Conn, I don't know if it was the first time, but
[0:04:42] SPEAKER_00: one of the times we were on retreat with him and I remember him saying, do you know how
[0:04:45] SPEAKER_00: much of this that you're feeling or thinking is personal?
[0:04:49] SPEAKER_00: And he said zero percent in his kind of Matt Conn way.
[0:04:53] SPEAKER_00: And I remember thinking zero percent?
[0:04:56] SPEAKER_00: That seems so unaccountable, right?
[0:05:00] SPEAKER_00: That's always my reaction to these things.
[0:05:03] SPEAKER_00: That's so unaccountable.
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_00: But here's the crazy part after listening to David.
[0:05:09] Unknown: What if the thought that that's unaccountable is conditioning?
[0:05:15] SPEAKER_00: So you all, if you've been listening for a while, might know that I had gotten mold illness
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_00: a while back.
[0:05:24] SPEAKER_00: And what mold illness does is it triggers your brain the same way that PTSD does, because
[0:05:29] SPEAKER_00: it creates this limbic system loop, right?
[0:05:33] SPEAKER_00: That creates all of this fear and running.
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_00: And my nutritionist, who's amazing, recommended recently I do this program.
[0:05:40] Unknown: It's called DNRS and I forgot what it stands for.
[0:05:46] SPEAKER_01: But for those who are interested though, the book is Wired for Healing and we'll put it
[0:05:50] SPEAKER_01: in the show notes just because I can feel people going, what is it?
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_01: We will put it in the show notes.
[0:05:55] SPEAKER_00: I got it.
[0:05:56] Unknown: Dynamic neural reintegration, dynamic neural reintegration, something like that.
[0:06:03] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately it's a rewiring of your brain.
[0:06:05] Unknown: Now you and I, Brooke, read this book, Wired for Healing, and it struck us.
[0:06:11] SPEAKER_00: It's a really powerful thought process that we can rewire our brains.
[0:06:15] SPEAKER_00: But they were talking about turning away in a certain regard, like not allowing your focus
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_00: to stay on your body, your health, your negative thoughts, and rather turning towards other
[0:06:29] SPEAKER_00: aspects of your experience that were happening at the same time.
[0:06:33] SPEAKER_00: And hopefully a positive one or a grateful one.
[0:06:36] SPEAKER_00: And you and I are like, I don't know, you know, total spiritual bypass.
[0:06:41] SPEAKER_00: But when my nutritionist was telling me about it, because she had participated in the program,
[0:06:46] SPEAKER_00: she said, that's just your conditioning saying that.
[0:06:51] SPEAKER_00: Now, like that's kind of interesting.
[0:06:53] SPEAKER_00: And I do want to talk about bypass and how we discern from this, because that's a very
[0:06:58] SPEAKER_00: real thing. And we all know that.
[0:07:01] SPEAKER_00: But let's just for the beginning, start to explore the crazy, amazing, potentially
[0:07:08] Unknown: liberating notion that most of what we're thinking is taught to us by a broken culture
[0:07:17] SPEAKER_00: and often sadly by an unhealthy lineage.
[0:07:21] Unknown: Yeah, who've existed within this broken culture and and the other.
[0:07:28] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Back to your time.
[0:07:29] SPEAKER_01: Going way, way back. Yeah, this is so what it's brought me into contact with, because
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_01: you and I've talked about this just conversationally.
[0:07:41] SPEAKER_01: We do talk off the air in the last week.
[0:07:45] Unknown: And I would say David's conversation with us has been dismantling me in some pretty
[0:07:54] SPEAKER_01: wonderful ways. Like he feels like a bright light that's just like rushing fresh air,
[0:08:05] SPEAKER_01: just fresh air here.
[0:08:06] SPEAKER_01: God vibes only. So it's affected me deeply and is affecting me deeply like that continues
[0:08:12] SPEAKER_01: to to percolate and move through the system.
[0:08:15] SPEAKER_01: And and what it's brought me really intimately in contact with is.
[0:08:21] SPEAKER_01: When you're on, for lack of better terminology, this path, as you go and go and go
[0:08:27] SPEAKER_01: and shed and shed and shed and come more and more into contact with your self, capital
[0:08:33] SPEAKER_01: S and with reality, capital R and whatever all these faulty words are that we want to
[0:08:38] Unknown: use that the the subtlety, the nuance that you have to have the capacity to hold.
[0:08:49] SPEAKER_01: And by hold, I mean living it as an inquiry.
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_01: Like there's this curiosity.
[0:08:54] SPEAKER_01: Like, is this true? This little felt sense over here?
[0:08:57] SPEAKER_01: What about this? Like that you're always willing to to inquire, not in the like
[0:09:04] Unknown: inspector gadget kind of monocle hunting down, playing detective kind of way, but in this
[0:09:13] SPEAKER_01: very deeply subtle way. So.
[0:09:17] SPEAKER_01: We can say that there are things that you and I hold very dear and are hugely why we
[0:09:26] SPEAKER_01: do this show.
[0:09:28] SPEAKER_01: And those remain true.
[0:09:31] SPEAKER_01: And then they just keep dissolving into more and more and more refined layers.
[0:09:35] Unknown: So some of the things that we hold very deeply, very much in our hearts that we want to
[0:09:41] Unknown: bring forward in our own lives and our own selves and in the world are like the harm of
[0:09:49] SPEAKER_01: spiritual bypass, the harm of spiritual ego making the way that positive psychology
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_01: power of positive thinking law of attraction can be annihilating to individuals and be
[0:10:01] Unknown: abusive. These are all things that we hold incredibly dear and still do and are very
[0:10:10] Unknown: true. And then because we are all in innocence, conditioned in a culture of duality.
[0:10:19] SPEAKER_01: We play we just do play hot potato for a long time.
[0:10:22] Unknown: You know, like we can get to a deeper layer of truth about conditioning or spiritual
[0:10:33] SPEAKER_01: bypass. And like I can I can see I'll have this epiphany, this clarity about spiritual
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_01: bypass in particular in myself, because that's the only thing we actually have.
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_01: So maybe I'll see the way I was spiritual ego making right.
[0:10:48] SPEAKER_01: And like, oh, I was doing that thing where I kind of turn away and, you know, whatever
[0:10:54] SPEAKER_01: it was in any given moment, because there's plenty of of time, plenty of layers that
[0:10:58] Unknown: that's happened. And so it's like hot potato, like, okay, so that's not the thing to do
[0:11:05] SPEAKER_01: anymore. So I'm going to go to the opposite extreme.
[0:11:09] SPEAKER_01: So now I'm going to I don't want to go up in a way.
[0:11:13] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to turn away. I don't want a bright side.
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to gloss over or like push my vibes way up and out.
[0:11:22] SPEAKER_01: And like, I just don't understand all the suffering in the world or whatever.
[0:11:25] SPEAKER_01: So I'm going to go over to this other extreme.
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_01: And I'm going to, in my case, because I'm very somatic, I'm very kinesthetic, really
[0:11:36] Unknown: feel all these things that are genuinely in there.
[0:11:42] SPEAKER_01: They're not make believe grief, shame, despair, anxiety.
[0:11:48] SPEAKER_01: And like, OK, I'm going to really come home to them.
[0:11:51] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to really allow them.
[0:11:53] SPEAKER_01: And then it's so funny, because if I grab on to that in the way that the mind or the
[0:11:58] SPEAKER_01: separate self moves so quickly, I can go.
[0:12:01] SPEAKER_01: Oh, OK, like without my conscious awareness, it becomes the new me.
[0:12:07] SPEAKER_01: No, this is the good one.
[0:12:10] SPEAKER_01: I used to think that one over there with the big high vibes and cute words or whatever,
[0:12:15] SPEAKER_01: like was the good one.
[0:12:16] SPEAKER_01: But I decided she's the bad one.
[0:12:18] SPEAKER_01: So now I'm going to be over here and she's the good one and that's the bad one.
[0:12:22] Unknown: And then maybe I hit a layer where I go, oh, I'm identifying with suffering to the
[0:12:29] SPEAKER_01: point that I'm I'm just suffering.
[0:12:32] SPEAKER_01: Needlessly, all pain, no gain.
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_01: So I could hot potato again, right?
[0:12:40] SPEAKER_01: And like, OK, so I'm not going to do the high vibe spiritual ego thing, but I'm going
[0:12:46] SPEAKER_01: to do the positive psychology, whatever on and on and on and on.
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_01: We all do this a million times in our lives where we ping and pong and ping and pong.
[0:12:54] SPEAKER_01: And then you've pinged and ponged enough.
[0:12:57] SPEAKER_01: And in our case, you have the chance to sit with people who don't ping and pong.
[0:13:02] Unknown: And you feel the expanse of this middle ground and you feel the nuance.
[0:13:11] SPEAKER_01: If you're not going to grab on and define one thing or the other, there's this whole
[0:13:15] Unknown: wide range of open space.
[0:13:18] SPEAKER_01: And so for me, the layer of that that I'm up against right now is like.
[0:13:22] SPEAKER_01: Exactly what you're saying and exactly what David was pointing to, like, oh, my God,
[0:13:28] SPEAKER_01: it's all.
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_01: Identity making.
[0:13:32] Unknown: In innocence, unconsciously, but very quickly got me realizing
[0:13:39] Unknown: I just start to put my little identity tendrils around.
[0:13:46] SPEAKER_01: The new identity, the new good one, right way.
[0:13:51] SPEAKER_01: You know, all that kind of stuff, the right way to heal the genuine, what, blah, blah,
[0:13:55] SPEAKER_01: blah. But as that sheds and sheds and we have the chance to sit with someone like
[0:14:02] SPEAKER_01: David, who just like lays it right out there, it's like.
[0:14:08] Unknown: What the fuck do you do in that place where you encounter the wide open field and
[0:14:16] SPEAKER_01: like the wide open field and I've had our time together, little glimpses here and
[0:14:20] SPEAKER_01: there, but it just keeps going.
[0:14:23] Unknown: Just keeps dropping away.
[0:14:27] SPEAKER_00: Probably because it is so incredibly hard for us not to try to think this through,
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_00: not to believe our thoughts, not to try to understand who am I?
[0:14:40] SPEAKER_00: What's my purpose?
[0:14:41] SPEAKER_00: You know, what am I here for?
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_00: You know, all of these questions that so many of us are consistently entertaining as
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_00: if that will give us the answer to life.
[0:14:51] SPEAKER_00: And we've had the pleasure of hearing over and over again from multiple sources.
[0:14:58] SPEAKER_00: You're not going to find the purpose or the meaning or the answer through the mind,
[0:15:05] SPEAKER_00: because the mind is.
[0:15:08] SPEAKER_00: Well, let's just say not the mind, but the thought process is conditioned.
[0:15:13] SPEAKER_00: It was fed to us somewhere like David said something in the interview.
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_00: Like you don't get to keep any thoughts, not one thought.
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:15:24] SPEAKER_00: And that's fairly mind altering because we think, well, we get to hang on to the good
[0:15:31] SPEAKER_00: thoughts or we get to hang on to the thoughts about who I am, because that's what we're
[0:15:35] SPEAKER_00: really thinking that we're looking for.
[0:15:38] SPEAKER_00: I feel when I started on the path, at least it's like, well, who am I really?
[0:15:43] SPEAKER_00: You know, and also what the hell is the purpose of all this?
[0:15:45] SPEAKER_00: But who am I was a big piece of this.
[0:15:49] SPEAKER_00: So we go out and the mind is seeking who am I?
[0:15:52] SPEAKER_00: But it keeps trying to do it through thought, not feeling and being not experiencing.
[0:15:58] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:15:58] SPEAKER_00: So we're always self reflecting.
[0:16:00] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I'm this person and I'm that person.
[0:16:02] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, I was thinking the other day, I was speaking with a client.
[0:16:07] SPEAKER_00: And what came into my mind as her and I were speaking was the whole introversion,
[0:16:12] SPEAKER_00: extroversion spectrum, for example.
[0:16:15] SPEAKER_00: So we're taught this is a spectrum and this is real.
[0:16:18] SPEAKER_00: Maybe it is. I'm not saying it's not.
[0:16:21] SPEAKER_00: But I started to think, well, all people seem to need people around.
[0:16:25] Unknown: Like humans are designed for connection and most people seem to benefit from some time
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_00: alone. So what if it's not a real thing?
[0:16:35] SPEAKER_00: What if extroversion is an identity of someone who's come to get validation through
[0:16:40] SPEAKER_00: contact with people and introversion is an identity of someone who's got
[0:16:45] SPEAKER_00: overwhelmed as part of their pattern of contact with people.
[0:16:50] SPEAKER_00: So. But as we believe I'm an introvert or an extrovert, we take it on as an identity
[0:16:57] SPEAKER_00: and we design our whole life around it.
[0:16:59] SPEAKER_00: Right. But what if this is just a concept?
[0:17:03] Unknown: You know, in David's interview, I'm booed at the gas pump that Brooke and I both found
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_00: him through. That was how we first contacted him.
[0:17:12] SPEAKER_00: He was telling this story about school and you and I touched on this a little bit in
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_00: our interview, but he didn't really get into it.
[0:17:18] SPEAKER_00: And he was talking about how the first time he learned words like knowledge and realized
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_00: there was a K in front of the end, but the K was silent.
[0:17:26] SPEAKER_00: He had this very deep thought like, holy shit, everyone's just making shit up.
[0:17:31] SPEAKER_00: Like this is garbage.
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_01: If you say so.
[0:17:35] Unknown: Making up rules.
[0:17:40] SPEAKER_00: Right. And I remember years ago reading a quote by Steve Jobs, and he said something
[0:17:45] SPEAKER_00: to this effect like once you realize everyone's just pretending and everyone's just
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_00: making stuff up, you start to be able to play with the matrix differently.
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_00: He obviously worded it different than I'm saying it.
[0:17:56] SPEAKER_01: But then I thought that was a really groovy quote.
[0:18:00] SPEAKER_00: Yes. I thought that was a really groovy quote, but I don't really think I got it.
[0:18:05] SPEAKER_00: Experientially, but I'm starting to get it like hot damn.
[0:18:11] SPEAKER_00: Everyone's making shit up like I might be worried about what so and so thinks of me
[0:18:15] SPEAKER_00: or so and so thinks of me, but why they're just making stuff up.
[0:18:20] SPEAKER_01: And I'm actually no, they don't have deep contact with me or reality half the time.
[0:18:26] SPEAKER_00: They're just doing what they were taught about something from someone else who was
[0:18:30] SPEAKER_00: probably fairly dysfunctional and didn't have contact with reality.
[0:18:33] Unknown: And they thought and mostly it's my thoughts about what they're thinking.
[0:18:38] SPEAKER_00: So it's not even them.
[0:18:40] SPEAKER_00: So it's just me making stuff up.
[0:18:42] SPEAKER_00: But what I make up defines my experience of reality.
[0:18:47] SPEAKER_00: Now, you and I understand that some of the complexity of this is that once these
[0:18:52] SPEAKER_00: thought structures and identity structures are in place, they do seem to come with some
[0:18:58] Unknown: physiological wiring.
[0:19:02] SPEAKER_00: Right. They come into place in a way that they affect the body.
[0:19:05] SPEAKER_00: So by an identity as an introvert, it's not that there's not some physical reality to
[0:19:11] SPEAKER_00: the overstimulation that happens with people.
[0:19:14] SPEAKER_00: It's just that once it's an identity, it's locked into place and it defines this
[0:19:19] SPEAKER_00: character that is Vanessa in a certain way.
[0:19:22] SPEAKER_00: And it's hard to get liberation.
[0:19:24] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, I was watching the movie A Beautiful Mind, and if any of you haven't
[0:19:29] SPEAKER_00: seen it, it's about this Nobel Prize winner, mathematician who had schizophrenia and
[0:19:36] SPEAKER_00: learned to essentially navigate his schizophrenia.
[0:19:38] SPEAKER_00: I think he was also on medication, side note, but learned to navigate his schizophrenia
[0:19:43] Unknown: by identifying those voices aren't real.
[0:19:46] SPEAKER_00: I can't listen to them.
[0:19:48] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, I'm watching it going, well, what's the difference with what he did and
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_00: what this DNRS program saying?
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_00: Like, this is just limbic hijack repeating itself in thought form versus what David's
[0:20:00] SPEAKER_00: saying about, hey, man, all your thoughts, just thoughts, just made up by someone and
[0:20:07] SPEAKER_00: probably someone screwed up because they were all raised in a fairly screwed up culture.
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_00: Right. Yeah. So what's the difference?
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_00: And then I started to think, well, you know, you and I believe that we can't ignore it.
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_00: We can't avoid it.
[0:20:22] SPEAKER_00: That doesn't work. We've tried that.
[0:20:23] SPEAKER_00: Bypass doesn't work.
[0:20:25] SPEAKER_00: That's why it's not a path.
[0:20:26] SPEAKER_01: That's why we're not interested.
[0:20:28] SPEAKER_01: That's just a bunch of bullshit that causes more harm to itself and to others.
[0:20:32] Unknown: Exactly. So you can't bypass it, but you also can't necessarily believe your thoughts.
[0:20:41] Unknown: You can believe your feelings, but they're influenced by your thoughts.
[0:20:45] SPEAKER_00: So, man, does this start to get really like going down a rabbit hole into Alice in
[0:20:51] SPEAKER_00: Wonderland territory.
[0:20:52] SPEAKER_01: Totally. And we spend so much internal time without being aware of it at all, trying to
[0:20:58] SPEAKER_01: make sure we're the ones having the right kinds of thoughts.
[0:21:04] SPEAKER_01: So it's not even like that we're taking the thoughts off the table in the way that David
[0:21:09] SPEAKER_01: so elegantly and directly did in his conversation with us.
[0:21:15] Unknown: We're like, OK, because we just we think we are them.
[0:21:20] Unknown: Yeah, we believe they're real.
[0:21:23] SPEAKER_00: We think they're real.
[0:21:24] SPEAKER_00: We think that they're real because we're thinking them.
[0:21:27] SPEAKER_01: And so if we are.
[0:21:30] Unknown: Thoughtful, empathic people actually fuck that if we're any kind of person, even if
[0:21:37] Unknown: we're the world's most harmful person, we spend all of our time internally to ourselves
[0:21:44] SPEAKER_01: unconsciously, trying to make sure we're having the right kind of thoughts.
[0:21:49] Unknown: So the full spectrum of humanity, the world's most healing, loving, tender, ego
[0:21:57] SPEAKER_01: identified person and the world's most harmful ego identified person, they're still
[0:22:02] Unknown: trying to ferret out.
[0:22:04] Unknown: Am I the one with the right kind of thoughts?
[0:22:08] SPEAKER_01: It's how we get object consciousness, right?
[0:22:11] SPEAKER_01: I'm the good kind of object.
[0:22:12] SPEAKER_01: They're the bad kind of object or this is the right kind of way to heal.
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_01: That's the wrong kind of way to heal, whatever the things are.
[0:22:19] SPEAKER_01: So we're spending so much time.
[0:22:22] Unknown: Believing that we are the thoughts, we're not taking it off the table completely.
[0:22:29] SPEAKER_01: So it's this constant mad dash.
[0:22:33] SPEAKER_01: To reinvent ourselves or basically we are investing all of our energy.
[0:22:38] Unknown: In just getting more and more lost in the corn maze.
[0:22:43] SPEAKER_01: So as we've been exploring these things in conversation since talking with David,
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_01: you know, you and I personally, and as this program has come up, what's it called?
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_01: DNRS.
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_01: DNRS.
[0:22:54] Unknown: What I have been dealing with, which I've been really open about on the show is like
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_01: as I've gone through this process of waking up, I've been able to see the world's
[0:23:09] Unknown: process of waking up.
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_01: There's been it's different a lot like there was an acute period that was very
[0:23:19] SPEAKER_01: intense for five months.
[0:23:21] SPEAKER_01: It's much lighter now, but it's still there of really intense sensation, anxiety,
[0:23:27] SPEAKER_01: strong emotions, things like that.
[0:23:28] SPEAKER_01: So early on, it's like.
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_01: It made sense, especially as somebody who has a history of trauma.
[0:23:40] SPEAKER_01: Has a history of anxiety, blah, blah, to kind of feel those sensations and go,
[0:23:44] Unknown: oh, OK, I need to turn towards them.
[0:23:49] SPEAKER_01: Like, I think this is one of the key things that we want to discuss, like, oh, OK,
[0:23:53] SPEAKER_01: I'm turning towards the.
[0:23:56] SPEAKER_01: Unpleasantness that that has been uncovered and that is there that I feel.
[0:24:02] SPEAKER_01: And there was a period of time where that felt like a healing thing,
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_01: like it just needed permission to exist.
[0:24:12] SPEAKER_01: It just needed permission to move through my system and not be getting sat on
[0:24:16] SPEAKER_01: anymore. There was nothing to sit on it anymore.
[0:24:19] Unknown: And so it just moved through.
[0:24:21] SPEAKER_01: And then now I'm at the place where if I feel it, which is still kind of a daily
[0:24:25] SPEAKER_01: occurrence, let's say it's like a yucky feeling in the gut or like a different
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_01: flavors of anxiety.
[0:24:31] Unknown: You know, why do I feel like it's that phantom limb pain?
[0:24:36] SPEAKER_01: It's a different variety of it than what I was talking about with David in the
[0:24:39] SPEAKER_01: conversation where.
[0:24:41] Unknown: I'm like. It's just.
[0:24:45] SPEAKER_01: Doing itself right, so I can go one of two ways with it mentally, I can say, oh,
[0:24:50] Unknown: OK. It's because there's something I really need to listen to here,
[0:24:56] SPEAKER_01: something really needs to be healed. That might be true.
[0:24:59] Unknown: But the other one is like, no, it's just.
[0:25:04] SPEAKER_01: A fucking habit.
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_01: At this stage, it's really just and it's because it in innocence so quickly got
[0:25:13] SPEAKER_01: wired in my mind.
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_01: It's important to always turn towards these sensations.
[0:25:21] SPEAKER_01: Which had this funny way of like holding sensation in place.
[0:25:27] SPEAKER_01: Because it it was like, oh, it's like playing fetch with your dog, right?
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_01: That's what we do with the ego.
[0:25:34] SPEAKER_01: Go find this, go fetch.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: Like, go find it sensation.
[0:25:38] SPEAKER_01: I got it. Boss, here you go.
[0:25:42] Unknown: Here's your sensation that you want to pay attention to.
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_01: Nobody would ever choose that.
[0:25:47] Unknown: It's awful. And there is.
[0:25:51] SPEAKER_01: A real truth to how does this get imprinted in the system?
[0:25:56] SPEAKER_01: How does this get imprinted?
[0:25:59] SPEAKER_01: In our nervous systems.
[0:26:01] SPEAKER_01: And you and I are very passionate about what is the intersection here?
[0:26:07] Unknown: Because. We can.
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_01: Meditate, we can inquire,
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_01: we can get all kinds of really, really, really useful
[0:26:19] SPEAKER_01: insight from listening to teachers and guides.
[0:26:24] SPEAKER_01: And and I think all those things are critical.
[0:26:27] SPEAKER_01: And there's also this nervous system piece, this
[0:26:30] Unknown: habit. What is the habit?
[0:26:33] SPEAKER_01: Habits that our systems.
[0:26:37] Unknown: Are running unconsciously,
[0:26:40] SPEAKER_01: because once you start to tug that thread.
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_01: Past all the other threads, right, like have.
[0:26:48] SPEAKER_01: You can really contact your own divine nature.
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_01: You can really have wonderful gurus and guides and teachers.
[0:26:55] SPEAKER_01: You can.
[0:26:57] SPEAKER_01: Really have so many epiphanies.
[0:27:00] Unknown: And. There can be this.
[0:27:04] SPEAKER_01: Janky. Wiring that keeps you trapped in hell,
[0:27:09] SPEAKER_01: or at least permits you to visit there frequently.
[0:27:14] Unknown: But it's just. The phantom limb pain.
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_00: That's probably why.
[0:27:21] SPEAKER_00: So many teachers recommend meditation,
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_00: even though you and I know that that could become an identity in a crutch.
[0:27:27] Unknown: But it's probably why, because in the space of silence,
[0:27:32] SPEAKER_00: you have the opportunity to see the part of the human program
[0:27:36] SPEAKER_00: that keeps trying to own something,
[0:27:39] SPEAKER_00: you know, trying to lock it down or create an identity around something.
[0:27:43] SPEAKER_00: Because I guess I'm getting the sense as you're talking.
[0:27:47] SPEAKER_00: I was thinking, well, you know, when people have awakened to the truth of reality,
[0:27:52] SPEAKER_00: they can meet all of these things without attaching identity to them,
[0:27:56] SPEAKER_00: because that's what awakening means.
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_00: Right. More identity, no more identifying, no more reference points.
[0:28:02] SPEAKER_00: But when we're still in the operating system
[0:28:06] SPEAKER_00: that doesn't know its soul, its God, its source, its everything.
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_00: Then that's the habit of the operating system.
[0:28:15] SPEAKER_00: You know, just the habit of this body mind is, OK, great.
[0:28:20] SPEAKER_00: Now, what do I do with this? How do I make sense out of this?
[0:28:23] SPEAKER_00: What does this mean to me? What does this mean about me?
[0:28:26] SPEAKER_00: Like, that's what it's always doing.
[0:28:28] SPEAKER_00: So it's really interesting to start to get hip to that fact
[0:28:34] SPEAKER_00: that most of this, most of what you're thinking
[0:28:39] Unknown: is a constructed reality and not just in some theoretical way.
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_00: I mean, that's what we're trying to convey here is we're getting it experientially.
[0:28:48] SPEAKER_00: Because, I mean, hello, I've read about this for 20 years.
[0:28:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, right. I know. I could quote this for a long time.
[0:28:53] SPEAKER_01: But experiencing it is different.
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_00: Like the world is a mirror of you.
[0:28:58] SPEAKER_00: Like, what were they trying to say?
[0:29:00] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's always happening in here.
[0:29:03] SPEAKER_00: It's like what David is saying, you know, if you say the flower smells,
[0:29:06] SPEAKER_00: but the smells happening in here, where if I say Jane doesn't like me,
[0:29:10] SPEAKER_00: but that thought is me having a perception of Jane. Right.
[0:29:14] SPEAKER_00: So it's always happening in here.
[0:29:15] Unknown: And these truths have been part of my life for for so long.
[0:29:21] Unknown: But to deeply sit with just as an inquiry,
[0:29:25] SPEAKER_00: I'm not making it even a statement, but to deeply sit with what if none of this is me?
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_00: Not the good thoughts, not the bad thoughts, not the,
[0:29:35] SPEAKER_00: you know, idealizable self, not the shameful suffering self.
[0:29:40] SPEAKER_00: Like to really sit with that as an inquiry.
[0:29:44] SPEAKER_00: It's so expansive.
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_00: And so I do think about like, so what does that mean?
[0:29:49] SPEAKER_00: And maybe it is just a process.
[0:29:51] SPEAKER_00: You know, you described different phases.
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_00: And I agree, you know, for me, there were different phases of coming to life.
[0:29:59] SPEAKER_00: You know, first for me to even turn towards myself,
[0:30:04] SPEAKER_00: my wounds, my inner child with a modicum of compassion was almost impossible.
[0:30:11] SPEAKER_00: Like that was the first phase.
[0:30:13] SPEAKER_00: Like, can I just look without going into a shame reaction?
[0:30:17] SPEAKER_00: And then it was like, can I meet it?
[0:30:20] SPEAKER_00: Can I recognize it's it's not me and it's not going to overwhelm me
[0:30:25] SPEAKER_00: and that I have the strength to be present, even as feeling and emotion
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_00: and memory was coursing through my body.
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_00: And then now it's something like then we were like, well, can I love it?
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_00: Can I bring tenderness towards it? Right.
[0:30:38] SPEAKER_00: So there's all these different phases.
[0:30:41] SPEAKER_00: And as I've been like integrating everyone that we speak with,
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_00: I'm like.
[0:30:49] SPEAKER_00: When you heard David talk about 40 days and 40 nights of Jesus sitting in the desert.
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_00: And Buddha also sat under the Bodhi tree, they have like extremely similar stories.
[0:31:02] SPEAKER_00: And I talk about this a lot with myself, with clients.
[0:31:06] SPEAKER_00: I always talk about this because let's just take, for example,
[0:31:09] SPEAKER_00: the way Buddha sat there, he sat there and what we can call demons
[0:31:13] SPEAKER_00: were dancing in front of him.
[0:31:15] SPEAKER_00: And every time he would point to them and he would say, I see you, Mara,
[0:31:19] SPEAKER_00: which means I see you illusion.
[0:31:22] SPEAKER_00: I see you delusion. Right.
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_00: And each time they would then disappear and the next one would come
[0:31:29] SPEAKER_00: until he realized none of this is capital R reality.
[0:31:34] SPEAKER_00: It is all some inherited construction. Right.
[0:31:39] SPEAKER_00: So that to me brings me power.
[0:31:42] SPEAKER_00: Like, I feel really like grounded when I imagine just sitting there on the earth,
[0:31:47] SPEAKER_00: watching as these different thought forms or identities
[0:31:52] SPEAKER_00: or ideas about how life should be and who we should be
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_00: and what it all means goes dancing before me.
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, I see you.
[0:32:00] SPEAKER_00: I see you for what you are.
[0:32:02] SPEAKER_00: But then I feel that that love piece
[0:32:06] SPEAKER_00: has to be the thing, like the super secret sauce.
[0:32:12] SPEAKER_00: I know I almost know I love it.
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know.
[0:32:16] Unknown: I know.
[0:32:17] SPEAKER_00: Bricks laughing at a Rick and Morty joke I embedded in that by mistake.
[0:32:22] Unknown: Sort of. So.
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_00: You know, did David say it in our interview or the other one?
[0:32:30] SPEAKER_00: I think he said it in both.
[0:32:31] SPEAKER_00: He was talking about he sometimes still dreams about demons.
[0:32:35] SPEAKER_00: He had a really, really painful childhood, if you all don't know that.
[0:32:39] SPEAKER_00: But he still sometimes dreams about demons.
[0:32:42] SPEAKER_00: And he meets them with love.
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_00: He said he hugs them.
[0:32:45] SPEAKER_00: Hey, demon, because he thinks they want love, too.
[0:32:48] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's it. Right. Yeah.
[0:32:51] SPEAKER_00: Like the illusions, the delusions.
[0:32:53] SPEAKER_00: But when we can meet it with love, what are we doing in effect?
[0:32:56] SPEAKER_00: What we're really doing is remembering that we're everything.
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_00: To be love is to recognize you are love.
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_00: And it is to embody, to experience, to allow the soul
[0:33:09] SPEAKER_00: to take center stage of your consciousness
[0:33:12] SPEAKER_00: as opposed to the identity projects.
[0:33:17] SPEAKER_01: Does that make sense for you?
[0:33:18] SPEAKER_01: It makes absolute sense.
[0:33:20] Unknown: I mean, I think that my bias, like the wiring of this one,
[0:33:25] Unknown: has a bias towards, you know, truth and clarity and,
[0:33:32] Unknown: you know, justice.
[0:33:34] SPEAKER_01: Like, I guess I'm saying I have a tendency to be judgy.
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_01: Right way, wrong way.
[0:33:41] SPEAKER_01: Good guys, bad guys. Nice way.
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_01: What I'm saying is that's historically reality for me.
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_01: And so, like anything, if that's my normal mode of operating,
[0:33:53] SPEAKER_01: this path of opening an awakening took that form for a long time.
[0:33:58] Unknown: It was a lot of seeing with clarity myself, my habits, my patterns,
[0:34:05] SPEAKER_01: the way that I projected on the world, what was actually happening in reality
[0:34:09] SPEAKER_01: versus what my mind was telling me was happening in reality.
[0:34:12] Unknown: That kind of clarity was and is so healing for me.
[0:34:16] SPEAKER_01: But because I'm prone to taking that to an extreme called judgment,
[0:34:22] SPEAKER_01: what that meant was there was a way that I was waking up.
[0:34:28] SPEAKER_01: To the like mechanics of the separate self.
[0:34:33] SPEAKER_01: And all of that was true.
[0:34:35] SPEAKER_01: Everything I was seeing was true.
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: But I was still kind of.
[0:34:41] Unknown: A hardening in my heart.
[0:34:44] SPEAKER_01: I think in so many ways, just because it's my blind spot,
[0:34:48] SPEAKER_01: it was just totally unfamiliar ground, you know,
[0:34:50] SPEAKER_01: so I could see with a great deal of clarity.
[0:34:53] SPEAKER_01: But I would spend my time being like, you know,
[0:34:57] SPEAKER_01: oh, I see the right way.
[0:34:59] SPEAKER_01: I see the pain body in me or in the culture or I see blah, blah, blah.
[0:35:07] SPEAKER_01: And it was actually, you know, beginning to work with very,
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_01: very deeply heart centered teachers, in particular, John Prendergast
[0:35:16] SPEAKER_01: and Matt Kahn found me.
[0:35:20] SPEAKER_01: I found them around the same time.
[0:35:23] SPEAKER_01: Jeannie Zandi as well, like, and these are all people that really,
[0:35:26] SPEAKER_01: to me, feel that they live from the heart.
[0:35:29] SPEAKER_01: And so by being with them and, you know, turning my awareness,
[0:35:35] SPEAKER_01: my attention towards their teachings, I could have the experience of.
[0:35:41] SPEAKER_01: Living from the heart, and I would say that that was when the real
[0:35:45] SPEAKER_01: freedom started to come into my life.
[0:35:50] SPEAKER_01: That was when the real softness and that was when I could really do the work
[0:35:53] SPEAKER_01: that I've always wanted to do since I was born, which is to be.
[0:35:58] Unknown: Useful to be a healing force in the world,
[0:36:04] SPEAKER_01: also to enjoy my life, because it's the only one I get to have.
[0:36:09] SPEAKER_01: David was pointing to really clearly, like, it's just me in here.
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_01: I'm the only one I get.
[0:36:18] Unknown: But that I could finally meet the world
[0:36:22] SPEAKER_01: and myself at the same time from a loving place.
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_01: And it was this really profound epiphany of like,
[0:36:29] SPEAKER_01: oh, that's the real thing, because if I'm always like taking the scalpel
[0:36:35] SPEAKER_01: to find and I think we can do that with the kinds of conversations
[0:36:38] Unknown: that you and I are having right now, like, OK, if it's all conditioning,
[0:36:42] Unknown: if it's all thoughts, if none of it is me, I'm going to get out my scalpel.
[0:36:48] SPEAKER_01: Like, how do we cut out all the parts that aren't true?
[0:36:51] Unknown: And if we haven't experienced what's left
[0:36:55] SPEAKER_01: after it all goes, that can feel really destabilizing for starters.
[0:37:00] SPEAKER_01: And it's also just a really aggressive way to be towards the self.
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_01: And that always automatically translates to how we are towards the world as well.
[0:37:09] SPEAKER_01: So I have come to the place for me again,
[0:37:13] SPEAKER_01: because like my pendulum swing can benefit
[0:37:17] SPEAKER_01: from swinging a little more over towards the heart side.
[0:37:22] SPEAKER_01: That if I prioritize
[0:37:26] Unknown: genuine love, genuine resting in the heart
[0:37:32] SPEAKER_01: and, you know, Jeannie's conversation, the most recent one that we had with her
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_01: on embodying Yin, I think carries that across very well, too,
[0:37:41] SPEAKER_01: which is why she and David were such a nice one to punch.
[0:37:44] SPEAKER_01: But like, this is what it feels like to rest in your being
[0:37:49] SPEAKER_01: with full permission to exist.
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_01: And that automatically means that the world has full permission to exist.
[0:37:58] SPEAKER_01: And then we can soften into this wide open field, this wide open ground
[0:38:04] SPEAKER_01: without it being, again, the mind's habit of moving very quickly to like,
[0:38:11] Unknown: what am I missing? What am I doing wrong?
[0:38:12] SPEAKER_01: What's the right way to excise all conditioning?
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_01: You know, we have to do it from the heart.
[0:38:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it has to happen from the heart.
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_01: Has to happen from the heart.
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_00: I just got a line from the Jetsons,
[0:38:25] SPEAKER_00: in case any of you are old enough to remember that cartoon.
[0:38:29] SPEAKER_00: Where he's like, yeah, I know.
[0:38:30] SPEAKER_00: He's like, Jane, stop this crazy thing.
[0:38:35] SPEAKER_01: That desperate feeling.
[0:38:36] Unknown: When one of their machines would go awry.
[0:38:39] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's like, we just want to stop this crazy thing called suffering.
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_00: We want to stop it.
[0:38:49] SPEAKER_00: And so it's very innocent to say, OK, so now here's the pathway.
[0:38:54] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, you and I were speaking before about how.
[0:39:00] SPEAKER_00: Interesting it is that we've.
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_00: Conceptually understood a lot of this for a long time now,
[0:39:07] SPEAKER_00: but there is a huge maturational journey for us, at least there was
[0:39:13] SPEAKER_00: between the conceptual understanding and the lived experience.
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_00: And that's what's the tricky part, because it's like you were saying, if you
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_00: if you don't have a lived experience of yourself outside of your thoughts,
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_00: the whole thing can be murky and destabilizing.
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_00: Right. You can try to cut out what's real.
[0:39:33] SPEAKER_00: Right. You can judge your personality.
[0:39:37] SPEAKER_00: You can do all sorts of funny, unhealthy, unhelpful movements,
[0:39:42] Unknown: sort of like if we were to look for a basic rule of thumb,
[0:39:47] SPEAKER_00: if what you're doing leaves you feeling nothing but the void, something's off.
[0:39:53] SPEAKER_00: Right. If what you're doing leaves you feeling nothing
[0:39:56] SPEAKER_00: but fear and suffering, something's off.
[0:39:59] SPEAKER_00: If what you're doing leaves you feeling a little relief
[0:40:03] SPEAKER_00: and a little tenderness, maybe that's a good path.
[0:40:06] SPEAKER_00: Let's keep exploring. Right.
[0:40:08] SPEAKER_00: Let's stay curious to the ever changing,
[0:40:11] Unknown: ever unfolding kind of journey ahead of us, because it is interesting.
[0:40:16] Unknown: I mean, you and I know
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_00: even these wonderful awakened teachers that we speak with,
[0:40:23] SPEAKER_00: they all have personalities.
[0:40:26] SPEAKER_00: There's something that doesn't get cut away.
[0:40:29] SPEAKER_00: But this identity structure that we're constantly creating and recreating.
[0:40:36] SPEAKER_00: That's what falls away.
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_00: But that's so inconceivable because we keep trying to conceive of it through the mind.
[0:40:46] SPEAKER_00: And I think that was the other thing that David kept offering back.
[0:40:49] SPEAKER_00: And quite frankly, a lot of teachers keep offering this back.
[0:40:53] SPEAKER_00: But since he was the recent one we spoke with, he kept offering back like,
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_00: you're only your being. You are your heart.
[0:41:00] SPEAKER_00: You are that, which is unnameable,
[0:41:04] SPEAKER_00: which is un-understand-able.
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_00: Remember that story that
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_00: Matcon told about how there's like, you know, the gates to heaven and
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_00: you know, it's like the ego walks up to the gates,
[0:41:23] SPEAKER_00: like the ego personality walks up to the gates and and the angels like,
[0:41:27] SPEAKER_00: you can enter heaven and the ego is like, OK, great.
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_00: Let me just understand one more thing about this.
[0:41:35] Unknown: Exactly. This is what we're all doing.
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_01: OK, great. Just let's get it out.
[0:41:42] SPEAKER_01: Just because I want to get it in my head a little more.
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_00: I want to get a diagram going on this if I could get a real like nice
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_00: diagram step one, step two.
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_00: And like, I want to do that, too, because I don't want to suffer.
[0:41:57] SPEAKER_00: And I most certainly don't want my beloved
[0:42:00] SPEAKER_00: other humans that are with me in this journey to suffer.
[0:42:04] Unknown: I mean, I wanted to add, and I know this is a little going backwards,
[0:42:10] Unknown: but when you were talking about judgment and like the mind kind of dissecting,
[0:42:16] SPEAKER_00: well, then wouldn't you think that that means that separate self is active?
[0:42:22] SPEAKER_00: Because how can you judge if separate self isn't.
[0:42:28] SPEAKER_00: Kind of pulling some of the visual and and auditory perceptions,
[0:42:32] SPEAKER_00: do you know what I mean? I do. Yeah.
[0:42:34] SPEAKER_00: Because if everything's one, what's there to like,
[0:42:37] SPEAKER_00: if you know you're God and everything's God, what's there to. Right.
[0:42:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. So there's a way that it can.
[0:42:46] SPEAKER_01: Perpetuate itself.
[0:42:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because it's like, oh, I'm going to pull all the threads
[0:42:50] SPEAKER_01: or I'm going to take out the scalpel and cut out all the tumors.
[0:42:53] SPEAKER_01: But it but it it needs to believe that the tumors are real.
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_00: Right. It created the problem.
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_00: It gave you the problem to solve and then it tries to solve it. Right.
[0:43:04] SPEAKER_00: Like, I got this. I got this. Yeah.
[0:43:05] SPEAKER_01: And it might be clear, right?
[0:43:07] SPEAKER_01: Like, oh, you don't have to, you know, tolerate an abusive relationship.
[0:43:12] SPEAKER_01: Like, that's pretty straightforward.
[0:43:14] SPEAKER_01: But that's called discernment, not judgment.
[0:43:16] SPEAKER_01: Right, right, right.
[0:43:17] SPEAKER_01: But like, you can do this thing of like, oh, they're they're behaving abusively.
[0:43:22] SPEAKER_01: Right. Like, that's clarity. That's clarity.
[0:43:25] Unknown: But you can scalpel ties it.
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_01: I love that we're inventing so many words this episode by being like, OK,
[0:43:32] SPEAKER_01: and what does that look like?
[0:43:34] SPEAKER_01: What was it in me that allowed it?
[0:43:37] SPEAKER_01: And what and you can just spend forever like cutting, punching holes in the fabric.
[0:43:44] SPEAKER_00: I know. Well, remember when David said
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_00: your your ego structure will keep putting guards at the gate to heaven?
[0:43:55] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And so I love that.
[0:43:57] Unknown: Guards to the gate. So good. Right.
[0:44:00] SPEAKER_00: It'll put judgment or and and and if everything's going good, it'll put,
[0:44:04] SPEAKER_00: you know, bliss as a guard to the gate to heaven.
[0:44:07] SPEAKER_00: Just like drooling on the couch,
[0:44:10] SPEAKER_00: caught up in the heaven realm.
[0:44:12] SPEAKER_00: Nothing here. Right.
[0:44:13] SPEAKER_00: Who wants to get out of, you know, that realm into into reality, right?
[0:44:18] SPEAKER_00: Into capital reality.
[0:44:20] SPEAKER_00: So I just think, you know, it's really funny.
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_00: And if we can be lighthearted about it all,
[0:44:26] SPEAKER_00: which sometimes is a real agonizing movement
[0:44:30] SPEAKER_00: since things are painful and it's hard to be lighthearted.
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately, we know
[0:44:36] SPEAKER_00: that's what it's about, being human.
[0:44:38] SPEAKER_00: And maybe that's why you need friends on this path. Right.
[0:44:41] SPEAKER_00: So at least we can laugh about this stuff together, because
[0:44:45] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we're talking about
[0:44:48] SPEAKER_00: what we believe to be human potential awakening,
[0:44:51] SPEAKER_00: that we believe that to be part of a potential
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_00: that a human has to evolve.
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if evolution is right word,
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_00: but it's part of their capacity and potential.
[0:45:01] SPEAKER_00: But it's like big deal shit.
[0:45:04] SPEAKER_00: Right. Like, yeah, just say the least.
[0:45:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we're talking about things that like aren't.
[0:45:12] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[0:45:12] SPEAKER_00: In some ways, don't you feel sometimes, Brooke, like,
[0:45:15] SPEAKER_00: I almost feel like why if we're meant to awaken, did they give us
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_00: minds and bodies that are this confusing?
[0:45:23] Unknown: I feel that way a lot of the time.
[0:45:26] SPEAKER_01: Like, why just doesn't make sense that this much hell realm is possible here?
[0:45:32] SPEAKER_00: It just seems like a really confusing game of life,
[0:45:36] SPEAKER_00: because even as we touch reality, like and we touch truth
[0:45:41] SPEAKER_00: and then next thing you know, all the identity structures
[0:45:44] SPEAKER_00: like tumbling back on themselves. Right.
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_00: Why don't we?
[0:45:49] SPEAKER_00: Aren't we here to see that?
[0:45:50] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I can't say who who really knows. But.
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: I just think that.
[0:45:59] SPEAKER_00: If we start to get curious, like whenever
[0:46:03] SPEAKER_00: I run out of a way to understand things, I just go back to the basic
[0:46:09] SPEAKER_00: just put a question mark next to it, you know, like just put a question mark.
[0:46:13] SPEAKER_00: I'll give you one more example.
[0:46:15] SPEAKER_00: When I was listening to testimonials for this program, I mentioned the NRS,
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_00: which I haven't done yet, everybody.
[0:46:21] SPEAKER_00: So but I'm deeply considering it.
[0:46:24] SPEAKER_00: When I was looking at listening to testimonials, there was a woman on the website.
[0:46:27] SPEAKER_00: She was a yoga teacher and she was getting more and more sensitive to EMF,
[0:46:32] SPEAKER_00: more and more sensitive to noise, more and more sensitive.
[0:46:34] SPEAKER_00: And she was saying, I started to think I was having superpowers even,
[0:46:38] SPEAKER_00: which I completely relate to.
[0:46:40] SPEAKER_00: And I think a lot of senses do, you know, it's like, oh, I'm getting heightened perception.
[0:46:45] SPEAKER_00: So she goes through this program, which is basically a training
[0:46:48] SPEAKER_00: for your limbic system to rewire and retrain your limbic system.
[0:46:52] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, goes away.
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_00: But her concept that this is a superpower, if she didn't test that,
[0:47:01] SPEAKER_00: could it kept her stuck in a traumatized body and nervous system?
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_00: Right. And I think so much of what we're talking about just has to do with that.
[0:47:11] SPEAKER_00: It's like my concept.
[0:47:12] SPEAKER_00: Oh, well, it's just mold poisoning.
[0:47:14] SPEAKER_00: I'll never be well.
[0:47:15] SPEAKER_00: Or if you have a concept that says I am an introvert and I need so much time alone,
[0:47:20] SPEAKER_00: I don't even know if I could be in a relationship or a concept that says,
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_00: you know, to suffer is the benevolent act.
[0:47:28] SPEAKER_00: And I am a benevolent person.
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_00: Therefore, I am the sufferer.
[0:47:32] SPEAKER_00: All of these are concepts.
[0:47:34] SPEAKER_00: But is it really true?
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And and I think that's the cool part.
[0:47:41] SPEAKER_01: I love the question mark pointer.
[0:47:43] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, the other thing I'll just say, because
[0:47:46] Unknown: you and I are slow motion living out this process in public.
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_01: And so people are listening to these conversations and everyone we interact
[0:47:54] SPEAKER_01: to who listens to the show is on their own path.
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_01: And so sometimes there can be
[0:48:02] SPEAKER_01: some concern or annoyance of.
[0:48:07] Unknown: Is it always going to be three steps forward, one step back,
[0:48:11] SPEAKER_01: two steps forward, two steps back at the data data and.
[0:48:16] SPEAKER_01: You know, just to counter that movement, a little bit of the mind of like,
[0:48:20] SPEAKER_01: this is murky and annoying and never ending.
[0:48:23] SPEAKER_01: And it's never ending for Brooke and Vanessa,
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_01: which means it's going to be never ending for me, too.
[0:48:28] SPEAKER_01: There is a thoroughness to this process that's out of all of our hands
[0:48:33] SPEAKER_01: where things are being healed all the way through.
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_01: And in my experience directly and in what I've noticed about the lovely teachers
[0:48:41] Unknown: and human beings we get to engage with, there is such a thing as.
[0:48:46] Unknown: Complete healing in, let's say.
[0:48:54] SPEAKER_01: For some people, it's like a big
[0:48:56] Unknown: you know, like Byron Katie, David Thomas
[0:49:01] SPEAKER_01: reading Jan Frazier's book, When Fear Falls Away.
[0:49:04] SPEAKER_01: I read that in the heart of my dark night, and I spent my
[0:49:06] SPEAKER_01: the whole time reading it being so annoyed with her because it was
[0:49:09] SPEAKER_01: she was just like, I don't know, fear went away.
[0:49:11] SPEAKER_01: It never came back. I'm like, fuck you.
[0:49:15] SPEAKER_01: Not helpful. Actually, I loved her book, but it was very painful to read it
[0:49:19] SPEAKER_01: at that time because my experience has been that it's much more tenuous.
[0:49:24] SPEAKER_01: You know, a big opening and then back in prison and big opening and back in prison.
[0:49:30] SPEAKER_01: But then things will clear at the root structure.
[0:49:34] SPEAKER_01: And I understand what someone like Jan Frazier was saying in her memoir, where
[0:49:38] SPEAKER_01: it's like, I can't go back in.
[0:49:40] SPEAKER_01: I don't even I can't even see the box anymore.
[0:49:43] Unknown: Like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[0:49:46] SPEAKER_01: And we can see this if we kind of zoom out on ourselves and our own trajectories
[0:49:51] SPEAKER_01: to that there are ways that we used to operate that felt true.
[0:49:56] SPEAKER_01: And now it's like, oh, my God, that would not have stuck to me
[0:50:00] SPEAKER_01: for two seconds now, because I just let's say if there's somebody
[0:50:04] SPEAKER_01: who's mistreating you in your life for a belief system
[0:50:07] SPEAKER_01: that you need to tolerate terrible living conditions or whatever, you're like, oh, no.
[0:50:12] SPEAKER_01: Now I can just see.
[0:50:13] Unknown: So there is such a thing as healing through to completion.
[0:50:17] Unknown: But this journey, you know, if if everything's love,
[0:50:22] Unknown: if God is love, it wants actual heaven for us.
[0:50:26] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't want like kind of sort of better.
[0:50:29] Unknown: Like, it's going for all of it healed all the way through.
[0:50:35] SPEAKER_01: So that is an action of love.
[0:50:37] SPEAKER_01: And then that happens in very different ways and different paces.
[0:50:42] Unknown: For all of us.
[0:50:44] SPEAKER_01: But I think it's important to attend to.
[0:50:48] Unknown: The.
[0:50:51] Unknown: Oh, it's never ending voice.
[0:50:55] Unknown: Yeah, I think that's a really good point.
[0:50:57] SPEAKER_00: It was almost like even when we were speaking with Miles Neal and I'm like,
[0:51:00] SPEAKER_00: wait, we should talk about some of the good news, because, you know,
[0:51:03] SPEAKER_00: we're on fire about the bad news here.
[0:51:05] Unknown: And and I think that is always helpful
[0:51:09] SPEAKER_00: to point towards, because I'm a completely different person.
[0:51:13] SPEAKER_00: And I still never really can go back to the shame that I had before.
[0:51:19] SPEAKER_00: I never really could. I can't go back.
[0:51:21] SPEAKER_00: What happens is when my limbic system is utterly hijacked,
[0:51:25] SPEAKER_00: physiologically, the shame thoughts dance through the head.
[0:51:30] SPEAKER_00: But I can see them and say, you're Maya.
[0:51:32] SPEAKER_00: But it doesn't mean I'm comfortable.
[0:51:34] SPEAKER_00: Almost like if it's like raining outside and you're chilly
[0:51:39] SPEAKER_00: and you know the rain is going to pass, like it's not life.
[0:51:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's not.
[0:51:43] SPEAKER_01: It's chilly. Yeah, I'm still chilly.
[0:51:46] SPEAKER_00: Right. You know, it's like that.
[0:51:47] Unknown: But but there is such good news because, you know,
[0:51:51] SPEAKER_00: when we talk about dimensions of reality,
[0:51:54] SPEAKER_00: like every dimension of reality has a different way that healing happens.
[0:51:58] SPEAKER_00: So sometimes, you know, I'll say to people,
[0:52:00] SPEAKER_00: it may feel like you're dealing with the same issue.
[0:52:03] Unknown: Like, let's say the issue is fear of money or, you know,
[0:52:08] SPEAKER_00: fear of relationship or whatever the case is.
[0:52:11] SPEAKER_00: You know, in level one, you have a certain way
[0:52:14] SPEAKER_00: that you're going to interact with.
[0:52:16] SPEAKER_00: And dimension one, I'm making this shit up, you guys.
[0:52:18] SPEAKER_00: There's no numeric dimensions just for conversation.
[0:52:22] SPEAKER_00: You know, you're going to go through a certain process.
[0:52:24] SPEAKER_00: But as that begins to shift and you enter a new perspective
[0:52:30] SPEAKER_00: or what we're calling dimension of reality,
[0:52:32] SPEAKER_00: there's a different kind of healing that happens for that very same wound.
[0:52:36] SPEAKER_00: Mm hmm. Right.
[0:52:37] SPEAKER_00: And each dimension has a different kind of healing
[0:52:41] SPEAKER_00: that may happen for that same wound.
[0:52:42] SPEAKER_00: So oftentimes, I think this was good you brought the Cimbra,
[0:52:46] SPEAKER_00: because when we're speaking about things over the last two years,
[0:52:50] SPEAKER_00: if you're just listening, it may even sound like we're circling
[0:52:53] SPEAKER_00: some of the same issues and fair enough, right?
[0:52:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have certain more challenging aspects.
[0:53:00] SPEAKER_01: But what I experienced it as is I'm meeting it
[0:53:05] SPEAKER_00: from a completely different dimension of perspective,
[0:53:08] SPEAKER_00: a completely different way of seeing it, holding it, meeting it,
[0:53:12] SPEAKER_00: so that a new level of healing can happen.
[0:53:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:53:17] Unknown: And then things start to move through in much softer ways.
[0:53:21] Unknown: Or I guess what I'm saying is,
[0:53:25] SPEAKER_01: it's just it becomes not work at a certain point.
[0:53:28] SPEAKER_01: It's more like you're just aware of the harder aspects in your life
[0:53:34] SPEAKER_01: and what you're up against.
[0:53:36] SPEAKER_01: And then things are delivered.
[0:53:39] SPEAKER_01: You know, like I get these kind of deliveries of clarity
[0:53:42] SPEAKER_01: and tenderness towards the self and the world.
[0:53:46] SPEAKER_01: Tenderness towards the self and the aspects that kept that,
[0:53:51] Unknown: you know, believed that part just to ground it in reality a little bit.
[0:53:55] SPEAKER_01: Like money is one of my more challenging issues,
[0:53:59] Unknown: belief system wise that I talk about a lot and like recently out of nowhere.
[0:54:04] SPEAKER_01: I wasn't thinking about money at all.
[0:54:08] SPEAKER_01: It was just like a rando vacuuming the house moment.
[0:54:12] SPEAKER_01: And it just landed on me with clarity, total epiphany.
[0:54:15] Unknown: Like, oh, oh, I've I've been chronically under running
[0:54:20] SPEAKER_01: because I need to feel afraid for my survival.
[0:54:25] SPEAKER_01: Not because I'm a bad person.
[0:54:27] SPEAKER_01: It was just this.
[0:54:29] SPEAKER_01: And so like the tenderness came at the exact same time as the clarity.
[0:54:34] SPEAKER_01: Love and clarity came together where it was like, oh,
[0:54:39] SPEAKER_01: oh, that was just a habit. Now.
[0:54:42] SPEAKER_01: Some shrink could have pointed that out to me 20 years ago if they wanted to,
[0:54:45] Unknown: but it didn't matter.
[0:54:46] SPEAKER_01: Like I needed to heal through all the layers. And then.
[0:54:50] SPEAKER_01: When an epiphany lands like that, you see it as absolute truth
[0:54:54] SPEAKER_01: and you have total love for whatever was operating inside yourself
[0:54:59] SPEAKER_01: to make that so lineage stuff, personal stuff, whatever, blah, blah.
[0:55:03] Unknown: And then it goes right.
[0:55:04] SPEAKER_00: You needed the fertile soil, right?
[0:55:07] SPEAKER_00: For that to be able to, you know, sprout into the revelation that you had,
[0:55:12] SPEAKER_00: the kind of revelation that really shifts things.
[0:55:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Where you're like, you can't believe anymore.
[0:55:17] SPEAKER_01: You're like, I see you, Maya.
[0:55:20] SPEAKER_01: In this survival fear.
[0:55:21] SPEAKER_01: But it's like, oh, oh, my gosh.
[0:55:24] SPEAKER_01: All this time.
[0:55:25] SPEAKER_01: And there's no shame or berating of the self.
[0:55:28] SPEAKER_01: Like, I can't believe I was doing this to myself all the time.
[0:55:32] SPEAKER_01: I wasn't plotting or planning it.
[0:55:33] SPEAKER_01: It was totally true for all of the years. It was true.
[0:55:37] SPEAKER_01: And at a certain point, the soil was loose enough that like the weed
[0:55:41] SPEAKER_01: got pulled out and I could see the roots.
[0:55:44] SPEAKER_01: I could see it go and I was like, oh.
[0:55:47] Unknown: Right. The end. Right.
[0:55:50] SPEAKER_00: And it could be a gentle process.
[0:55:52] SPEAKER_00: And it is a journey to come to that stage because the ego
[0:55:56] SPEAKER_00: needs something to anticipate.
[0:55:58] SPEAKER_00: So you're just observing how your ego needed to keep this to anticipate.
[0:56:03] SPEAKER_00: With anxiety, I mean, need something that was just another guardian at the gate.
[0:56:07] Unknown: Right. Right.
[0:56:09] SPEAKER_00: Like, that's what Matt Khan said to me when I asked him about my fear of death.
[0:56:13] SPEAKER_00: And I don't specifically mean my dying.
[0:56:15] SPEAKER_00: I just mean everyone dying.
[0:56:17] SPEAKER_00: I just mean, I don't know what I mean. Really.
[0:56:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Here to my parents.
[0:56:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm not really sure.
[0:56:22] SPEAKER_00: And when I asked him about it, I was expecting some real fancy pants answer
[0:56:26] SPEAKER_00: about like a past life or, I don't know, reincarnation or,
[0:56:30] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, something real mystical.
[0:56:33] SPEAKER_00: You know, I love that.
[0:56:34] SPEAKER_00: You know, and and Matt was like, well, I think that's just possibly your ego's
[0:56:39] SPEAKER_00: way of having another thing to anticipate.
[0:56:42] SPEAKER_00: And that what that's been for years, the thing I anticipate.
[0:56:46] SPEAKER_00: Oh, well, but we're all going to die.
[0:56:48] SPEAKER_00: OK. Just another thing to anticipate, because it's the guard at the gate to heaven.
[0:56:54] Unknown: The ego can't give up blaming, shaming, judging or anticipating.
[0:57:00] SPEAKER_00: Those are the movements of the ego.
[0:57:03] SPEAKER_00: So if you notice that those things are looping. OK.
[0:57:09] SPEAKER_00: Hi, Maya. There's a guardian.
