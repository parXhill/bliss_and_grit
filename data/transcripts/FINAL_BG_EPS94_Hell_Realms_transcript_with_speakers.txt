[0:00:24] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Brooke Thomas. I'll be joined soon by
[0:00:35] Unknown: my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scato. On the show, we're talking about being on the awakening
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_01: path. And what does that actually mean? What is a real evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_01: embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit
[0:00:53] SPEAKER_01: that is a human life? Today, we're talking about when we are so contracted by very real things like
[0:01:02] Unknown: chronic illness or chronic pain or PTSD that we cannot reach a state of gratitude or relief and
[0:01:10] SPEAKER_01: certainly not of joy. Instead, we're coping with the responses of our nervous systems and our
[0:01:15] SPEAKER_01: physiology that feel much more akin to being trapped in a hell realm. These are the dimensions
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_01: of reality where we can't get any perspective. We often don't remember how to meet even our
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_01: basic needs. And so we spin. And we also deal with quite a lot of suffering on top of the suffering
[0:01:34] SPEAKER_01: of the illness or of the situation itself. So we're getting into how to survive and how to work with
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_01: these states. They're very painful and disorienting. And there are ways to open up some workability,
[0:01:49] Unknown: even when you're in the midst of one. If you're enjoying the show, we will be thrilled. If you
[0:01:55] SPEAKER_01: left a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit, you can also go to

[0:02:13] SPEAKER_01: they navigate this path. So sessions with us can also be another way to support our work. And at
[0:02:18] Unknown: the same time to get some very direct and intimate support for yourself. Last thing, we curse if
[0:02:27] SPEAKER_01: you're new here, heads up on that. So headphones if there are kiddos around. Okay, here we go.
[0:02:36] Unknown: Hi, Brooke. Hey, Vanessa. Where do I begin this week? So this week, I'm still reflecting on the
[0:02:47] Unknown: interview we had with Will Pye. And I'm sure a lot of people felt this way. But one of the things
[0:02:57] Unknown: that strikes me the most in sitting with Will Pye was his joy. You know, the way he smiled,
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_00: the level of gratitude that he naturally was able to reach in the aftermath, despite living with
[0:03:16] Unknown: a diagnosis of brain cancer. And I thought that was really interesting. Because
[0:03:26] SPEAKER_00: I know there must be something to be said about, you know, he said it himself, sometimes when you
[0:03:31] SPEAKER_00: get a terminal diagnosis, or something that can be perceived as terminal, it does something where
[0:03:36] SPEAKER_00: it really shakes you up in a certain kind of way, it simplifies what matters. And I have been
[0:03:43] SPEAKER_00: diagnosed with mold illness in case anybody's new to the podcast. Many of you who've been listening,
[0:03:48] SPEAKER_00: you know this already. I never felt that way. I was never like, so grateful for this, you know,
[0:03:56] SPEAKER_00: what a choice opportunity. I'm really ready to get in the game and glad I'm evolving, you know.
[0:04:04] SPEAKER_00: And, and we spoke with him a little bit about his guesses on how that opened up for him.
[0:04:10] Unknown: In some ways, these things are just mysterious. But, you know, it struck me, it struck me. It's
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_00: a unique stance to be able to take, which is part of why we wanted to have him on the show, right?
[0:04:21] SPEAKER_00: It's a really amazing and impressive thing when you can walk that path of trusting your life so much
[0:04:28] SPEAKER_00: that even when something comes that can be physically, possibly mortally threatening,
[0:04:34] Unknown: you still say, yes, God, thank you. Right? Amazing. So, you know, I was sitting with that this week.
[0:04:43] Unknown: And of course, as life would have it in concert to sitting with that and being in that field of
[0:04:50] SPEAKER_00: resonance, the mold levels in Austin start to rise dramatically. It's like some kind of a crazy,
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_00: unusual September, they say, where it's raining all of the time and mold is going through the roof.
[0:05:03] SPEAKER_00: And for people who may not be familiar with what happens, as the mold levels rise, they start to
[0:05:10] SPEAKER_00: attack the limbic center of my brain, I start to feel drunk. And then eventually it starts to feel
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_00: like the worst hangover of your life and your brain gets inflamed. And my limbic system starts
[0:05:20] Unknown: to really go bananas. So all week, I'm stuck in this state of well, towards the end of the week,
[0:05:30] Unknown: last few days, I'm stuck in this state of terror, despair.
[0:05:43] SPEAKER_00: Like all those old critical voices keep pouring in. And, and the interesting thing is like,
[0:05:51] Unknown: in moments like these, especially when, you know, you have an illness, like a question such as
[0:05:57] SPEAKER_00: should I leave Austin arises, like, Oh, should I get out of town and just remove myself from
[0:06:02] Unknown: from the environmental factor? It's like I'm in the freeze mode of the nervous system,
[0:06:07] SPEAKER_00: and I can't figure out what I should do. Right. And there's all these like, big questions,
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_00: like, should I leave if I should leave? When should I leave? And where should I go?
[0:06:16] SPEAKER_00: So there's these like larger questions. But there are smaller questions, like, do I tell a friend
[0:06:22] Unknown: that I'm having a really shitty time? Or do I keep it to myself? When my husband says,
[0:06:29] SPEAKER_00: Oh, should I go meet so and so for coffee? Do I say yes, and let him live his life? Or do I say,
[0:06:37] SPEAKER_00: No, it's, it's easier for me if you're around, right? Like, there's all of these things.
[0:06:44] Unknown: But I noticed that my body's in this complete freeze mode, which just makes the terror get
[0:06:50] Unknown: more because it's almost like, you know, something's wrong, but you don't know what to do about it,
[0:06:58] Unknown: right? Which the ego loves to know what to do about it. So one of my blessings in having dealt
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_00: with this is having this great level of awareness. I know this isn't me. I know it's my nervous
[0:07:11] Unknown: system. I know it's my neurobiology. Possibly, it's ancestral trauma. Possibly, it's some of my own
[0:07:21] SPEAKER_00: trauma from having endured this, like, it's like, I have very clear awareness, which gives me some
[0:07:26] Unknown: spaciousness and some patience. But what I've been grappling with is like, can we shift when we're
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_00: talking about things like chronic illnesses, which Brooke, I know you know a thing or two about as
[0:07:42] Unknown: well? Can we shift to states of gratitude? Like, Will Pye was talking about, or you and I have had
[0:07:49] Unknown: experiences with Matt Kahn talking about that? Do we meditate? When we're in terror? Do we meditate
[0:07:57] Unknown: with the nervous system? You know, what do we do to open up some breathing room to give ourselves
[0:08:06] SPEAKER_00: some support and nourishment when our mind and our body and our thoughts and our being are
[0:08:13] Unknown: hijacked by our physiology? As you're talking, I know you're going to end with like, what do we do,
[0:08:20] Unknown: right? And I'm like, I don't know. Right. Don't answer. Let it be a long exploration.
[0:08:28] Unknown: Just the setup.
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_01: I don't know. This is something that's a lived inquiry for both of us in such an intimate way,
[0:08:39] Unknown: and very, you know, different ways. But for those who are new to the show, so I had a birth injury
[0:08:44] Unknown: when I was born, had my fair share of trauma when I was a kid, on top of that, and grew up with
[0:08:53] Unknown: chronic pain, jaw disorder, spine pain, hypotonicity, and a seizure disorder,
[0:08:59] SPEAKER_01: I had petite mal seizures. So I grew up with my body not being the friendliest place ever.
[0:09:04] SPEAKER_01: And my work is in the wellness field. My work is in a role for, as a role for, I primarily work
[0:09:11] SPEAKER_01: with people who are dealing with chronic pain or mobility issues. So this is such an intimate
[0:09:18] SPEAKER_01: dance in my life. And you know, I got significantly better in my early 20s. I'm in my,
[0:09:29] SPEAKER_01: my God, I'm going to be 44 soon, Vanessa.
[0:09:31] SPEAKER_01: I know.
[0:09:32] SPEAKER_01: Do I have to say mid 40s now?
[0:09:35] SPEAKER_00: Welcome.
[0:09:35] Unknown: Welcome. Actually, 40s are rad for those of you who are listening. Big fan. But those 20 years
[0:09:45] SPEAKER_01: where I've been much, much healthier than I was growing up, my body has felt like a way
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_01: more welcome and amazing place. There's also been still health issues or, you know, backslides,
[0:09:59] Unknown: things come, things go. So that intimacy with body crisis is a big part of my life.
[0:10:07] SPEAKER_01: I work with coaching clients who are dealing with chronic illness. And
[0:10:12] Unknown: there are so many ways in, right, for like, how do we get more awareness and how do we get a little
[0:10:19] SPEAKER_01: accessibility so that it doesn't grab us. And I think it's worth defining what I mean by it,
[0:10:26] Unknown: which is like what you were saying that there, there is, when you have a chronic health condition,
[0:10:32] Unknown: there's suffering, there's suffering of the body. You're so tired, you can't function, or you have
[0:10:40] SPEAKER_01: chronic pain, or you can't move the way other people can move, or you can't spend as much time
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_01: awake and out in the world as other people can, or simple things like you can't go out to a
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_01: restaurant, just eat whatever the hell you want, and your friends can. So there's, there's suffering,
[0:10:54] SPEAKER_01: it's very real, it's very tangible, it's of the body, it's of reality. But when I say it grabs you,
[0:11:03] SPEAKER_01: what I mean is the suffering on top of the suffering. And it's the suffering of
[0:11:09] SPEAKER_01: belief systems about what this means about you and what this means about your life in general.
[0:11:18] Unknown: So usually it goes, it meaning the mind goes to the past and says, and it'll maybe remember a time
[0:11:27] SPEAKER_01: when you had three months on your back, you know, or something terrible, or it'll just kind of give
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_01: you the panoramic view and say, yeah, as a person who lives with a chronic illness or chronic pain
[0:11:39] SPEAKER_01: or whatever, it's quite unpleasant and it will project a story. Because anything that happens in
[0:11:45] Unknown: the future, look, we can make intelligent assumptions, I'm not saying that that's not true,
[0:11:52] SPEAKER_01: but we still also with that have to hold the reality that because it hasn't happened, it is
[0:11:58] SPEAKER_01: pure fantasy. And that there have been plenty of times where we thought something was going to go
[0:12:03] SPEAKER_01: one way in our lives. And it didn't. So we have to be able to at least hold that as a possibility,
[0:12:09] SPEAKER_01: right? But the mind, this fear, it gets a hold of a story from the past, it projects it on the future
[0:12:14] Unknown: as if for sure that is the truth. And the truth can be, it will always be like this, or everyone
[0:12:23] SPEAKER_01: thinks you're a weirdo, or it will get much, much worse. And everything will be terrible. Everyone
[0:12:31] SPEAKER_01: thinks you're crazy, whatever the stories are. So that's the suffering on top of the suffering of
[0:12:40] Unknown: the body. And I think that when we can get some pliability, and of course, we can talk about ways
[0:12:46] SPEAKER_01: to do that, because that's where I went into my like, I don't know, because there are just so many
[0:12:49] Unknown: ways in to getting this pliability, so that those two layers of suffering are not adhered. And I
[0:13:00] Unknown: think sometimes we can even find that when they de-adhere, when the suffering on top of the
[0:13:07] Unknown: suffering isn't so believable, or so tenacious, or just hooked in, that our relationship with the
[0:13:17] Unknown: tangible suffering of the body, pain, fatigue, whatever it is, that we can start to develop a
[0:13:25] SPEAKER_01: relationship with it, because it's not the enemy other anymore. And as soon as it's not the enemy
[0:13:31] Unknown: other, things do open up in a way where we can have a different kind of
[0:13:39] Unknown: rapport with the reality of who we are, none of which is predicated on needing to get better,
[0:13:47] SPEAKER_01: feel better, be better, do better. It's just the reality of whatever's happening at any given
[0:13:52] Unknown: moment. And I think that's the key thing is that pain and illness, they can mushroom and they can
[0:13:59] SPEAKER_01: spiral in such fast and compelling ways. And this is true about anything that we're afraid of, but
[0:14:05] Unknown: our bodies are kind of like, I mean, anything we experience in this life,
[0:14:10] SPEAKER_01: happens to happen through a body. As long as we're alive, it's happening through our bodies. And so
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_01: when our bodies have certain kinds of barriers, it just can quick, the fear can very quickly
[0:14:22] Unknown: escalate about, I'm doomed. Right. And so you can observe those types of thoughts. And I agree with
[0:14:31] Unknown: you, Brooke, the body is fundamental. So, you know, you have certain limitations that get imposed by
[0:14:38] SPEAKER_00: whatever you're coping with. Let's say in my case, I can't go outdoors. So I'm stuck in my house. And
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_00: then I have the discomfort of sitting around on my couch all day, for example, but then my mind
[0:14:50] Unknown: starts to go and it goes, well, look at everybody outside. You know, what are those people doing?
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_00: Right. And like, oh, Mario went out, I guess this is life now. I live on my couch. Right. So
[0:15:03] SPEAKER_00: you can notice the spiraling thoughts that keep intensifying it. Right. And the despair grows as
[0:15:12] Unknown: the thoughts kind of gather momentum. But additionally, what I experience it as, and I
[0:15:22] Unknown: think, you know, we've been kind of pointing to this as well, is it's like I'm in a different
[0:15:30] Unknown: dimension of reality completely. Yeah. Right. And Brooke and I have kind of talked a little bit about
[0:15:36] SPEAKER_00: dimensions of reality being, you know, the dimensions of perspective when you're in a
[0:15:41] SPEAKER_00: different dimension of reality. It's what you're capable of perceiving, seeing, knowing, feeling,
[0:15:47] SPEAKER_00: accessing. And when my nervous system gets really hijacked, when my limbic brain is just being
[0:15:54] SPEAKER_00: pushed on, it feels more like a hell realm. It's like what's accessible. What's accessible seems to
[0:16:01] SPEAKER_00: be suicidal thoughts, you know, despair, disconnect. I'm the worst, you know, I'll always be the worst.
[0:16:10] Unknown: That seems to be the flavor of a thought that runs through my mind, right? Possibly everybody's mind.
[0:16:19] Unknown: So what's interesting is it's like, I can start to see it. So luckily, I have this awareness and I've
[0:16:26] Unknown: luckily had it for most of my illness. I feel like thankful for my meditation practice for that
[0:16:35] SPEAKER_00: reason. I've mostly had awareness, okay, this isn't me. Something's happening. Sometimes it
[0:16:40] Unknown: takes me a few days to notice, but I can see that. And I can see that thoughts just adding suffering
[0:16:46] SPEAKER_00: on top of suffering. And that thought's not wholly true. It's almost like I could do a Byron Katie
[0:16:51] Unknown: style check on it. And yet 10 minutes later, there's that thought, right? Coming right back
[0:17:01] SPEAKER_00: through because it's almost like I'm still jammed into a certain dimension of reality where this is
[0:17:08] SPEAKER_00: the flavor that's available to me. I was listening to a Hay House radio episode with Matt Cahn,
[0:17:15] SPEAKER_00: and he was talking about gratitude. And he was saying, you know, when he wants to access
[0:17:20] SPEAKER_00: gratitude, especially when we have tough things like this happening in our life, like he'll look
[0:17:24] SPEAKER_00: at the date. So today's September 23rd, 2018, and he'll say, well, that date will never happen
[0:17:32] SPEAKER_00: again. It's never happened before. It'll never happen again. And that's one pointer to what you
[0:17:36] SPEAKER_00: were saying before, Brooke, like every moment is new and you're projecting the past onto the future.
[0:17:42] SPEAKER_00: And that like, you know, released a little gumminess. And then he started talking about,
[0:17:48] SPEAKER_00: um, can you find gratitude? Now, of course, I can't quite get to the stage where I'm like,
[0:17:54] Unknown: I'm grateful for this illness. Yay. But you know, I can find gratitude for the compassion it gives
[0:18:01] SPEAKER_00: me for the understanding it gives me because sometimes I forget that things like psychological
[0:18:09] SPEAKER_00: trauma, things like physical trauma, things like chronic illness can really like jam people
[0:18:16] SPEAKER_00: into these states. Like I forget sometimes I don't totally forget, but you can almost treat
[0:18:22] SPEAKER_00: things too lightly like, Oh, honey, don't you see it's not like that. It's like this, you know, and
[0:18:28] Unknown: and then I remember all too clearly like, Oh no, the density of what their experience, it's so
[0:18:36] SPEAKER_00: gluey, it's so sticky, it's so believable. So I can be grateful for my understanding and I can be
[0:18:43] Unknown: grateful for slowing down. And I can be grateful for having a supportive family. So I could start
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_00: to access some of that. And that gave me a little bit less intensity to the experience,
[0:19:00] Unknown: which was helpful. But I think it's almost like what we talk about a lot in our awakening in the
[0:19:08] SPEAKER_00: nervous system episodes or other ones like that. It's like, seems to me that first you have to be
[0:19:13] Unknown: able to find some measure of safety in your body. Otherwise, everything I do that comes from a
[0:19:20] SPEAKER_00: cognitive exercise level, eventually wears off sometimes extremely rapidly, sometimes an hour or
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_00: two or a day, right, but it's like, as long as my body is in this hijacked place, where it's only
[0:19:35] Unknown: capable of perceiving certain dimensions of experience. I really can't seem to get quite
[0:19:45] Unknown: enough space around it. Yeah. And I'm it's funny, you brought up hell realms, was starting to write
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_01: a new blog titled demonic possession and hell realms in a cheeky way, of course, but like,
[0:19:59] SPEAKER_01: hell realms, that is hilarious. That's delightful. But I wanted to write about it because
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_01: you hear this phrase hell realms, it comes from, you know, Buddhism, and of course, hell,
[0:20:11] SPEAKER_01: plenty of ideas in the Judeo Christian tradition about what that means. But when you are in this
[0:20:18] SPEAKER_01: contracted state, or we could say when the nervous system is in this contracted state, that is a hell
[0:20:23] SPEAKER_01: realm. And where you are living in hell, certainly, I had a year of this process,
[0:20:30] SPEAKER_01: not too long ago, where it was a year of PTSD purge time. And I had already done a lot of therapy,
[0:20:40] SPEAKER_01: I had done precise trauma therapies like EMDR and lens neurofeedback, all of these things helped
[0:20:45] Unknown: quite a lot. Craniosacral therapy, very helpful. But there was just this like,
[0:20:55] SPEAKER_01: if I'm being totally honest, right, instead of being like, don't worry, guys, here's the good
[0:20:59] SPEAKER_01: news. If I'm being totally honest, there was a period of time where there was just this purging
[0:21:04] SPEAKER_01: of my body where every trauma was just like up not not necessarily in a tangible way, like reliving
[0:21:10] Unknown: it. But the physiology of the trauma, my nervous system would go into the physiology of the moments
[0:21:17] SPEAKER_01: of trauma. And what I had capacity to do at those times, and we've talked about this on the show
[0:21:24] Unknown: before, but there are some times where it's like, find any whiff of safety. I spent a lot of time
[0:21:34] Unknown: under a heavy, delightful comforter in my bed. A lot. It wasn't clinical depression.
[0:21:44] SPEAKER_01: It was, you know, because it wasn't like, I hate being in this bed, but I can't seem to
[0:21:49] SPEAKER_01: get up and meet the world. It was like, I need to retreat to safety, this thing is moving through
[0:21:54] SPEAKER_01: me. It almost felt like a train moving through me. Now, I had had a lot to lead me up to that point,
[0:22:02] SPEAKER_01: so there was a ton of preparation where there was this willingness, availability, capacity for my
[0:22:08] SPEAKER_01: nervous system to let it all unfreeze because freeze is definitely my pattern. It was my
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_01: way of surviving, not uncommon for somebody with a trauma history.
[0:22:19] SPEAKER_01: And it was like, you know, we're going to go through a period of months here of unfreeze.
[0:22:25] SPEAKER_01: What that meant is it actually literally moved through my body. And I think it only did that
[0:22:30] SPEAKER_01: because I actually had the working capacity because I had spent decades, you know, two decades
[0:22:36] Unknown: before that getting very intimate with my body, developing a very friendly relationship with it
[0:22:45] SPEAKER_01: and a lot of rapport. So sometimes when we turn towards these things, it's not necessarily like
[0:22:51] Unknown: Insta, easy street. Sometimes it's permission for something that's been frozen to finally move
[0:23:00] Unknown: through in that case, in the case of trauma, or even in the case of turning towards, finally turning
[0:23:07] SPEAKER_01: towards like, yes, I am a person with chronic pain. Yes, I'm a person with chronic illness, and it
[0:23:12] SPEAKER_01: feels like this. So that's a certain stage that can be pretty help realm me. And there's just no
[0:23:19] Unknown: way to talk your nervous system out of it. But we can find the really, really, really basics
[0:23:27] SPEAKER_01: of human need for safety, comfortable bed, to call friends and have them come over if that feels
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_01: like you have some people in your life where that's an available thing. Do have people bring you
[0:23:40] SPEAKER_01: fresh, healthy food that makes your body feel nourished. Do drink more water and tea than normal.
[0:23:46] SPEAKER_01: And I don't know where but I remember hearing Jeannie Zandi talk once about her dark night
[0:23:51] Unknown: experience and that there was just a period of time where it felt like she was in a sweat lodge
[0:24:01] SPEAKER_01: and she was crawling on her belly on the ground to find the one millimeter of cool air,
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_01: you know, and just letting that one millimeter of cool air lead her to the exit to where there was
[0:24:15] SPEAKER_01: more cool air. And there are periods of time that just feel like that. And I'm not bringing this up
[0:24:20] SPEAKER_01: to be a super bummer, which I know I have a tendency to do sometimes. Like my personality
[0:24:24] Unknown: structure can hang with despair pretty well. But there's so many ways that that's great news,
[0:24:30] Unknown: right? Because it's I'm not trying to sell anyone a insta feel better potion and that if we can know
[0:24:36] Unknown: in those moments, there are some periods of time where we are sniffing along the ground for any
[0:24:43] Unknown: whiff of fresh air and that that's the beginning. That's the beginning of finding safety. Now,
[0:24:49] Unknown: once we get some basic needs met, rest, get in bed, you know, drink extra water today. It sounds
[0:24:59] SPEAKER_01: silly but honest to God, when we're in these kind of hell realm places, those things become so potent
[0:25:04] SPEAKER_01: and so powerful. Take a bath. It seems so funny. Yeah, like put on noise canceling headphones and
[0:25:12] Unknown: an eye mask and just lay in your room and like feel cocooned. Put on the AC to the just right
[0:25:18] Unknown: temperature, whatever it is, you know. And that is a beginning as opposed to because it would be
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_01: very easy for the mind to grab onto that and tell a story of, wow, you're really a mess.
[0:25:31] SPEAKER_01: And I think that for sensitive people, we get that story internally a lot. Wow, you're really a mess.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: If your need is this great that you have to lay around in your room under a comforter for this
[0:25:41] SPEAKER_01: long, like wow, this sensation in your body means you are really fucked up. Like what is wrong with
[0:25:46] Unknown: you? If we can just say like hell realms are real, they're a state of the nervous system.
[0:25:51] SPEAKER_01: They're a particular dimension of reality, meaning we're perceiving ourselves, our lives,
[0:25:56] Unknown: and our physiology is having a certain kind of experience. And it is temporary. And so my job
[0:26:06] Unknown: while I'm in it, while it's here, is find basic safety. I mean, is that your experience,
[0:26:13] SPEAKER_01: like where you feel like just those teensy wafts of safety can be the beginning of more workability?
[0:26:21] Unknown: Yeah, because it's almost like until that happens, usually I'm stuck in the judgment that you're
[0:26:29] SPEAKER_00: describing, right? And it's not that Vanessa has this judgment. It's like this judgment is running
[0:26:35] Unknown: through my cranked nervous system. So on my normal day, I don't think, oh, you have a problem.
[0:26:44] SPEAKER_00: You're so screwed up. What's the matter with you? And I would never think of a client. I would know,
[0:26:49] SPEAKER_00: you know, that's not what arises for me naturally. But in that cranked nervous system,
[0:26:56] Unknown: there's so much of this is a problem. You're a problem, right? And it feels true. Right. That
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_00: is what hell is. It's this completely dualistic state. And it's there is a problem and you're a
[0:27:08] Unknown: problem. And you just keep bouncing back and forth. So either I feel a victim of this problem that I
[0:27:16] SPEAKER_00: could label mold illness or the problem that is elevated mold outside or something like that.
[0:27:23] SPEAKER_00: And then you feel sort of forsaken by God, right? Like, where's God? Why are the mold levels rising?
[0:27:30] SPEAKER_00: As if, you know, God did something to me. And then or then I'm a problem, right? What's the matter
[0:27:38] Unknown: with you? Are you crazy? Why can't you just shouldn't you just and it is, you know, there's
[0:27:47] SPEAKER_00: a teacher, Neelam, that you and I both studied the nervous system with an awakening. And she was
[0:27:54] Unknown: talking about the ability to be present, being dictated by the nervous system, the capacity of
[0:28:01] Unknown: the nervous system at any given moment, which is predetermined, meaning I can't control the capacity
[0:28:08] Unknown: of my nervous system is what it is at any given moment. So what she was saying is, if you don't
[0:28:15] SPEAKER_00: have the capacity in your nervous system to be here with whatever's arising, which is predetermined,
[0:28:22] SPEAKER_00: you can't discern what's coming through your mind, you can't discern what's real,
[0:28:29] Unknown: you can't discern what's your conditioning, what's your fear, what's your ancestral lineage trauma
[0:28:35] SPEAKER_00: coming through, right? You can't discern. And I think that's a lot of what the experience is when
[0:28:41] SPEAKER_00: you're going through something like this. It's like, okay, as I was saying, all these different
[0:28:45] Unknown: thoughts will come through your mind. Should I go see a friend? Should I do this? Should I do that?
[0:28:52] SPEAKER_00: And I can't discern what voice to listen to and what's real and what priority is, which is
[0:29:00] SPEAKER_00: probably why my nervous system has also been prone to freeze and dissociation. It's like,
[0:29:06] Unknown: well, if I can't discern, do nothing. It's like, don't move. That's been, you know, the habit of
[0:29:12] SPEAKER_00: my body. And I think she says that her definition of trauma is the energetic residue that's still
[0:29:21] Unknown: present in your nervous system. Right. So interesting because, you know, I have to imagine,
[0:29:26] Unknown: let's say in a moment like this, you know, yes, mold's been shown physiologically to attack the
[0:29:33] SPEAKER_00: limbic brain. So I know that there's some outside energy that's influencing this sensitive body of
[0:29:39] Unknown: mind. But once that happens, I am sure that some of my trauma that is not to do with the mold,
[0:29:50] SPEAKER_00: maybe it's to do with having been sick before, maybe it's to do with my childhood and feeling
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_00: powerless with outside influences. Maybe it's to do with my family's history of mental illness and
[0:30:01] SPEAKER_00: their pain and trauma that hasn't been processed. That's still a residue in my nervous system.
[0:30:06] Unknown: Right. So all of this starts to come up. So I've been thinking, but I haven't been totally able yet
[0:30:13] Unknown: to play with it. But I've been thinking that Neelam's approach, which is to just do your best
[0:30:24] Unknown: tenderly and kindly and lovingly to follow sensation so that you can help your nervous system and brain
[0:30:33] SPEAKER_00: come to the present moment, bring their awareness to the present moment, because you're always
[0:30:38] SPEAKER_00: present. But your attention may be distracted with your thoughts or, you know, with your projections.
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_00: And I think that that may actually make a difference because have you ever tried
[0:30:52] SPEAKER_00: Judith Blackstone's fundamental consciousness meditations when you've been hijacked?
[0:30:57] Unknown: Yeah. Oh, yeah. You're quite helpful. Very helpful. I don't know why I don't do it more.
[0:31:03] SPEAKER_01: Well, because when we're hijacked, the last thing we have access to is like, what was that?
[0:31:08] SPEAKER_01: We should just put Post-it notes up around our house. Do attunement to fundamental consciousness.
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_01: I swear to God, it's helpful. All right. See the Post-it note. Right.
[0:31:18] SPEAKER_00: I just thought that today. I was like, okay, as soon as this is over, I have to remember to
[0:31:24] SPEAKER_00: write myself a note like, Dear hijacked Vanessa, here's what helps. I promise. I actually love
[0:31:30] SPEAKER_01: that idea. The Dear hijacked Vanessa, Dear hijacked Post-it note somewhere, because that's
[0:31:37] SPEAKER_01: the thing is that category of your brain, the oh, here's what's helpful category. It's just
[0:31:42] Unknown: offline. It's God. And you know, most people aren't trained in this, don't have this level
[0:31:49] SPEAKER_00: of understanding or awareness. So, you know, even though I might have a beloved husband,
[0:31:54] SPEAKER_00: I mean, he's the sweetest. Thank God. So blessed for that. And I have really good friends and
[0:31:58] Unknown: everything. It's very rare that someone can say, honey, find safety and come to your body. And can
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_00: you be here now and just be here? And oh, you know, that meditation that works for every time.
[0:32:12] SPEAKER_00: That's all you have to do. You don't have to figure out anything else. All you have to do is that.
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_00: Right. Like there's no voice of wisdom for most of us that's going to come from the outside to
[0:32:23] SPEAKER_00: remind us, which is maybe part of what makes it feel so spirally is like you're in it.
[0:32:30] SPEAKER_00: You don't know what to do. It feels like you have to do something that you're so confused
[0:32:34] SPEAKER_00: and powerless, right? Like it only amplifies the whole intensity of the thing. So to be like,
[0:32:40] SPEAKER_00: Dear hijacked Vanessa, you know, you're not a problem. Yes, you are lovable. No,
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_01: not everyone hates you. Right. Yes. There's nothing you can figure out from the mind.
[0:32:53] SPEAKER_01: Those thoughts seem interesting and like they're going to lead you somewhere.
[0:32:56] Unknown: They're not. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah. You only have to do this. Meditate and breathe. Don't try to
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_00: solve everything. That would probably be really helpful. Yeah. It's making me think of just in
[0:33:11] SPEAKER_01: case this is a story that's useful because I think the more that we can do that, the more that we can
[0:33:15] Unknown: attune to whatever gives us access to a more flexible nervous system so that we can have
[0:33:24] SPEAKER_01: experience a different dimension of reality. So we might still be sick. We might still be in pain.
[0:33:29] SPEAKER_01: We might still be suffering, but we start to have access to something else. And that that is like a
[0:33:35] SPEAKER_01: capacity that grows the more we attune towards it. I was, this was maybe a couple of years ago,
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_01: I was driving my car was on the highway and I had an experience which is very common for me,
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_01: which is my brain got hijacked thinking about a traumatic incident from the past. Very common. I
[0:33:54] SPEAKER_01: don't mean to say that now like my brain got hijacked. Something that we all do very commonly,
[0:33:58] SPEAKER_01: right? Like suddenly we remember something terrible that happened or even just something
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_01: frustrating, honestly. But it started to feel so large. I just wasn't there anymore. Like in the
[0:34:10] SPEAKER_01: car I was totally captivated by this memory and feeling all the fear and the fear of the moment.
[0:34:17] SPEAKER_01: And then also all of the stories, you know, I can't believe that happened. What was I thinking? I
[0:34:23] SPEAKER_01: should have known better, blah, blah, blah, all the things. So I'm totally caught in that whole
[0:34:28] SPEAKER_01: cycle that we all know very well on the inside. And then all of a sudden something, awareness,
[0:34:37] Unknown: really awareness brought my attention to the way it felt to be holding the steering wheel. And
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_01: suddenly I just had this very, very, very intimate experience of hands holding steering wheel,
[0:34:49] SPEAKER_01: the temperature, the texture, the grip, the position of the hold. And my body relaxed because,
[0:34:59] SPEAKER_01: and then I realized, oh my God, I'm in a car, I'm driving a car. And then the next thought that I
[0:35:05] Unknown: had was, oh, I'm right here right now. I guess I must have survived it. It's over. And it was this
[0:35:14] Unknown: totally visceral like, oh my God, we did it. I must have survived that because I'm right here
[0:35:25] SPEAKER_01: right now. But when that really arrives in your system, it's like, oh my God. So the whole
[0:35:31] Unknown: structure that had gotten activated, unhooked. And the reason why that happened, partially grace,
[0:35:41] Unknown: sure. But it was also because I've devoted myself to doing that. I've devoted myself to awareness,
[0:35:50] SPEAKER_01: I've devoted myself to embodiment, to bell body, to sensation. And so there was something in there,
[0:35:57] SPEAKER_01: some capacity that could just turn me that way. It doesn't happen that way all the time.
[0:36:01] Unknown: To be honest, these days, I don't really get hooked by trauma memories in that way. But that
[0:36:07] Unknown: was such a great moment of like, oh my gosh. So I think that as we turn towards it, we really do get
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_01: more pliability. And in that case, it's like, okay, well, that's PTSD, that experience wasn't
[0:36:24] SPEAKER_01: happening anymore. In the case of chronic illness, what if it is still happening,
[0:36:28] SPEAKER_01: you still have chronic pain, or you still have some kind of dysfunction.
[0:36:35] SPEAKER_01: Then we're coming back to the reality of the moment, we're peeling off the additional layer
[0:36:41] Unknown: of suffering. Well, and you can be unhooking your nervous system from over stimulation,
[0:36:50] SPEAKER_00: right? So it's almost like, okay, I'm currently suffering from physical symptoms. But in addition,
[0:36:59] Unknown: if my nervous system is overloaded, it goes into fight, flight or freeze. I don't know how this
[0:37:07] SPEAKER_00: can happen to me. It feels like sometimes all of them are cycling through, which I know,
[0:37:13] Unknown: theoretically, I don't think can happen on a nervous system level. But my pulse is racing,
[0:37:20] SPEAKER_00: and yet I feel like I can't move and I'm sometimes dissociating.
[0:37:23] SPEAKER_01: Both. Like if you imagine putting a being in a car foot on the gas, foot on the brake,
[0:37:28] Unknown: is that your system's doing both. Oh, okay. So it's that experience of like,
[0:37:34] SPEAKER_01: but you're can't or like, having the emergency brake on the car and flooring it, you know,
[0:37:38] SPEAKER_00: that kind of feeling. Oh, God, it's a terrible but wonderful descriptor,
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_00: because it actually feels like that. Okay, so there you go. Perfect. Thank you for that. So
[0:37:47] Unknown: then I then freezes my state of occupying. But if your nervous system is hijacked, in this case,
[0:37:54] Unknown: in a state of freeze, but could be fight or flight, you can't move. You literally can't do
[0:38:02] SPEAKER_00: anything different. There's no responsiveness, right? There's only a reactivity. So yes, in theory,
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_00: even if I can come present and see like my hands are on the wheel, and I'm driving,
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: and everything's okay, right, like right here. Now, everything's okay. And relief can get created
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_00: in my nervous system, then I can start to get my being back online and have some access to
[0:38:29] SPEAKER_00: discernment and clarity, which then may say, No, you may want to go to the doctor, you may want to
[0:38:37] SPEAKER_00: take a sauna, right? Like then all of a sudden, different things can come through.
[0:38:42] SPEAKER_00: So it's, it's true, you're right, when some things happened in the past, and it's still stored in
[0:38:47] SPEAKER_00: your nervous system, and you're just re experiencing the trauma remnants, because they haven't been able
[0:38:54] Unknown: to be met, and released from your body. It's a wonderful thing to realize, I've survived this,
[0:39:00] SPEAKER_00: this is in the past. But I suppose, regardless, if we can become present, because I have experienced
[0:39:07] SPEAKER_00: this, as I said before, with Judith's meditations, or such, at least we have some breathing room,
[0:39:14] Unknown: at least we have some responsiveness, at least we have access to our minds again,
[0:39:20] SPEAKER_00: right clarity, it's a tremendously unsettling thing, not to have access to your own clarity.
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And I think Will is a wonderful living example of somebody who
[0:39:31] SPEAKER_01: is experiencing a dimension of reality that comes from a very, let's say, healthy, flexible,
[0:39:38] Unknown: nervous system, that's not in fight, flight, freeze, and something very tangible and reality
[0:39:45] Unknown: based, you have brain cancer. And so the dimension of reality that he perceives it from changes his
[0:39:52] SPEAKER_01: experience of it completely, completely, and we can look at him as an example and go, Okay, well,
[0:39:58] SPEAKER_01: so first he was able to have a different experience of the diagnosis. So he's not in a
[0:40:03] SPEAKER_01: hell realm. In fact, we could say he's in heaven, right? Heaven says what he said on the interview,
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_01: which was like, Oh, my gosh, well, this is a lot to work with, this is going to be really great,
[0:40:15] SPEAKER_01: there must be something really great that's going to come out of this, because his nervous
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_01: system had had the experience when something giant gets dumped in my lap, and I'm forced to digest it,
[0:40:26] SPEAKER_01: something really good comes out of that process. Something evolutionary is happening. So there
[0:40:31] SPEAKER_01: this must be some giant gift, that's just a dimension of reality, it's a capacity for
[0:40:38] SPEAKER_01: perceiving the situation. And then, you know, look at all the things he's done, he's written a book
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_01: that I'm sure has touched many chronically and terminally ill people's lives. He does coaching,
[0:40:50] SPEAKER_01: he does the love and truth party, he does a podcast, like here's somebody who is not at all
[0:40:53] SPEAKER_01: immobilized, right? He still has brain cancer. We didn't get into this in the conversation with him,
[0:41:00] SPEAKER_01: I'm sure he doesn't exactly feel tip top every day. Every disease process or chronic illness
[0:41:06] SPEAKER_01: is different. Certainly, some are a lot harder to work with than others in terms of the
[0:41:15] SPEAKER_01: obviousness and incapacitating nature of the symptoms. But just the same, he's not going to
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_01: have any problems. But just the same, we can say like, here's somebody who is an example of
[0:41:29] SPEAKER_01: having access to that dimension of reality with the exact same tangible
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_01: reality, tangible diagnosis. Right. And we start to realize like, oh, that must be available
[0:41:43] SPEAKER_00: as just something the species can do. Right. It's part of our human potential.
[0:41:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's true. One thing I have been kind of in awe of as I've been looking at it this go round,
[0:41:56] SPEAKER_00: which has just primarily been the last few days that it intensified was, oh, that's fascinating
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_00: because clearly my body's going through something and it's turning all these thoughts around and
[0:42:08] Unknown: it's kicking up all this traumatic debris, let's say. And I am the observer. Now I know from,
[0:42:18] SPEAKER_00: this is like spirituality 101, like you are not your thoughts because you're observing them.
[0:42:23] SPEAKER_00: You are not what you do. You are the observer. But it was really cool to have a reminder moment
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_00: of that. Like no matter what my body was going through, no matter the thoughts that were stirred
[0:42:36] SPEAKER_00: up in reaction to my nervous system and my brain being in a certain position,
[0:42:42] Unknown: I am the observer, which then means I'm not just my body, which is a really awesome thing to realize.
[0:42:51] SPEAKER_00: It's I used to have this idea and I don't know where I got it. Maybe I got it just from
[0:42:56] SPEAKER_00: grappling with health issues as a child, but I used to have this idea. It's almost like,
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_00: you know, to really be enlightened, you must have to have some basic health because otherwise it's
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_00: really hard to have access to clarity and like good feelings and things like that.
[0:43:13] Unknown: Maybe I even got it from Chinese medicine since the body, mind and spirit were so interconnected
[0:43:19] Unknown: and health was such an important concept. But when you realize like actually, no,
[0:43:26] Unknown: awareness happens regardless of what's happening with your health. Awareness happens regardless of
[0:43:33] SPEAKER_00: the types of thoughts I'm thinking, regardless of the types of feelings I'm having. There's even
[0:43:38] Unknown: that moment we've all had this in some way, shape or form, like where you're watching what's happening
[0:43:45] SPEAKER_00: and you can't stop it, but you're like, oh my God, like you're watching a movie or something,
[0:43:50] SPEAKER_00: you know, like that moment where you're like, I wish I wasn't saying this thing to that person
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm fighting with, but why am I still talking? Right? Sure. Yeah. And you have that experience
[0:44:00] SPEAKER_00: where you're like observing it, like it's this movie unfolding, which can feel really weird and
[0:44:06] SPEAKER_00: your mind can take that bit of data. And if it's predisposed to a certain kind of trauma,
[0:44:11] SPEAKER_00: it can create a really painful context. Like I'm a victim of my thoughts and there's nothing I can do.
[0:44:18] SPEAKER_00: But the other way of experiencing it, which is what I started to get contact with was
[0:44:24] Unknown: my body's not me. There's more to this story. And no matter what I'm going through in this
[0:44:34] Unknown: particular moment, it's not my totality, right? It's not my definition. And no matter what my
[0:44:41] Unknown: body's enduring, I am still here. I just think that's a really, for me, like even as I'm trying
[0:44:50] Unknown: to describe it, a relieving experience. Totally. Because suddenly you're not trapped. You're not
[0:44:57] SPEAKER_01: trapped in your viewpoint. You're not trapped in your symptoms. None of those things are static.
[0:45:04] SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's what our mind does is it tells the forever story or the it will get worse story.
[0:45:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And the doomed, doomed like so much doom when you're in that kind of a contracted state,
[0:45:15] Unknown: right? Yeah. And I don't know why this comes to mind, but I'll share it because it seems like
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_01: it's what wants to come forward. There can be a way when we're in a hell realm. So our nervous
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_01: system is contracted. And let's say because it's what we're talking about today, we're suffering
[0:45:31] SPEAKER_01: with a chronic illness or something physical or something that feels like we just can't easily
[0:45:36] Unknown: get away from it. Yeah, we can't shake it. That we can hear conversations like this.
[0:45:41] Unknown: That we can hear conversations like this. And we can either do the thing that we all know about,
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_01: which is bright side it right like, no, I'm super grateful. I'm gonna be grateful. So we, I think,
[0:45:52] SPEAKER_01: know that pattern well enough. So I want to look at a different pattern, which basically says,
[0:45:57] Unknown: the mind says, give me proof that it will work in my situation. And I'll try it. By it, I mean,
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: anything that provides some workability to a different kind of perspective in the nervous
[0:46:11] SPEAKER_01: system. So we've talked about a myriad of different ways in or different viewpoints on things.
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_01: And the mind can really tell the story of like, that's great for them.
[0:46:25] Unknown: Give me proof that it will work for me. And I'll be willing to try it. It's this funny little trick.
[0:46:31] SPEAKER_01: I've watched my mind do it so many times to keep us from having any workability in our nervous
[0:46:37] SPEAKER_01: system. And so just give a little like look-see for that fellow, not in a like, he's the enemy
[0:46:45] SPEAKER_01: who needs to be eradicated. Because it's actually this very, I think, for most of us, sweet young
[0:46:50] Unknown: part that was kept safe by being like the skeptical one. You know, by being the one outside the group
[0:46:56] SPEAKER_01: being like, you fools can go do whatever. I'll be over here keeping myself safe from hurt feelings,
[0:47:05] SPEAKER_01: from trying something that might fail from feeling humiliated, whatever those things are. So if we
[0:47:11] Unknown: can see that as like this very, very sweet, albeit misguided internal part of ourselves,
[0:47:18] SPEAKER_01: then maybe we can get hip to it a little bit. And that can be the beginning of more workability in
[0:47:24] Unknown: the nervous system, because there's just willingness to do whatever is available,
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_01: willingness to like, let's say the mind is saying, I need to figure out, you know, I'm in panic mode,
[0:47:36] SPEAKER_01: I feel like shit, and I need to figure out what the next steps are. And I can't make a decision.
[0:47:40] SPEAKER_01: I don't know what's wrong with me. And then the mind spins, spins, spins, spins. The willingness
[0:47:46] Unknown: to say, to look at your sticky note, dear, act, dear, hell realm, broke. I know you think your
[0:47:56] Unknown: mind is going to come up with a great solution. Instead, sit in a quiet room, pull down the shades
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_01: and do the attuning to fundamental consciousness. And the mind will go, Oh, sure, give me proof
[0:48:09] SPEAKER_01: that that's really how is that really going to be useful? And we go, I see you sweet skeptical part,
[0:48:14] Unknown: I get it. But the sticky note says, and to really try it. So I just want to bring that character,
[0:48:23] SPEAKER_01: our skeptical character into the mix here, because it's one of the ways that we can seal ourselves
[0:48:29] SPEAKER_01: into a hell realm. And we don't have to be willing to look in a mirror like Stuart Smalley and say,
[0:48:35] SPEAKER_01: every day in every way, I'm getting better and better, or people like me, they really like me,
[0:48:40] Unknown: whatever. What really works, you have permission to nap in your bedroom this afternoon, you have
[0:48:49] SPEAKER_01: permission to not figure anything out and to do a somatic meditation. You have permission to stop
[0:48:56] Unknown: everything you're doing and make a cup of tea, small things. You got me thinking about,
[0:49:05] Unknown: if I had a little voice, I think it'd be more like a like an Eeyore character, like why bother
[0:49:11] SPEAKER_00: anyway, you know, it's got that like doom and gloom kind of thing to it. And it is sweet. I mean,
[0:49:19] Unknown: that's only a really innocent part of myself that at one time in my life experienced myself quite
[0:49:29] SPEAKER_00: trapped in what were traumatic circumstances for me. Right. It's like, most of us were children
[0:49:37] Unknown: at one point, right. And if anyone had childhood trauma, you were kind of trapped. If you think
[0:49:44] SPEAKER_00: about it, right, kids can't leave. And so in that case, you can experience yourself as like,
[0:49:52] SPEAKER_00: learned helplessness would be the psychological term for it. Right. I'm just calling it Eeyore.
[0:49:57] SPEAKER_00: The learned helplessness can also be another one of the little characters that come up. And
[0:50:02] SPEAKER_00: when that arises, the most tender way we can move with it is like to kind of turn around and give
[0:50:09] SPEAKER_00: it a hug. Yeah. Because it's just a part of you that at one point learned physiologically,
[0:50:17] SPEAKER_00: cognitively, that there's nothing to be done, that it's all just happening and there's no way
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: through it. So it is interesting. Maybe everyone can get to know their own little characters
[0:50:29] SPEAKER_00: and how they come up. Right. And they come up usually because of imprints of trauma on our
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_00: nervous system from the past. These aren't created by us the same way as we never choose how our
[0:50:40] Unknown: nervous system will respond. Right. That is chosen. That is unconscious. We don't choose our nervous
[0:50:47] SPEAKER_00: system capacity on any given day. Neelam likes to make sure everyone gets the point. It is
[0:50:53] SPEAKER_00: pre-determined. So stopping so hard on yourself is the implication of her message is pre-determined.
[0:50:59] SPEAKER_00: So maybe we can all look for our little characters and write Eeyore a note too. But
[0:51:05] SPEAKER_00: the other part I wanted to bring in based on what you said, Brooke, was expectations are so
[0:51:11] Unknown: interesting. In that case, you could have a part of you that has an expectation. It doesn't want
[0:51:18] SPEAKER_00: to get hurt. So it doesn't want to believe something good can happen because it doesn't
[0:51:22] Unknown: want its expectation to get let down. Learned helplessness is like an expectation that things
[0:51:27] SPEAKER_00: won't work. But across the board, one thing Will was talking about was he didn't have the why me
[0:51:36] Unknown: thing. You know that we expect to be healthy, for example, as a part of a normal human right
[0:51:47] Unknown: or as a part of a good spiritual life. I expect to, in my case, let's say,
[0:51:58] SPEAKER_00: I expect to be able to go out and socialize when I want or I expect to have access to bliss and
[0:52:02] Unknown: those dimensions of reality or I expect to not be sick and to be taken care of by the universe,
[0:52:15] Unknown: you know, God or whatever, in such a way that I won't be sick. So when you start to see those
[0:52:23] SPEAKER_00: expectations, I think those are other little things that create suffering because it makes
[0:52:28] Unknown: it hard to be here. Right. Because then it feels like there's a problem. Right. That's when they
[0:52:35] SPEAKER_00: call it resistance. But resistance always has this conscious energy to it. Like, yeah, there's someone
[0:52:40] SPEAKER_00: in here. You can stop doing it. Yeah. Right. And I don't like the implications of that. But
[0:52:47] SPEAKER_00: but these thoughts can become barriers because if this isn't supposed to be, then naturally,
[0:52:55] Unknown: I'm not moved to just sit with it as it is and move to work against it or to fight it or to try
[0:53:01] SPEAKER_00: to solve it. Right. And that's all fine in due course, because if you don't have access to the
[0:53:08] SPEAKER_00: here and now, so you can't access clarity without your conditioning or trauma, fuzzing out your
[0:53:16] SPEAKER_00: reactions. You don't know how to move in a way that's really the most loving and intelligent.
[0:53:22] Unknown: So it's almost like observing how we expect things to be. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's seeing reality if we
[0:53:33] SPEAKER_01: we can let it be a little comedic in the moments when it's a possibility to notice how comedic it
[0:53:39] SPEAKER_01: is. No, that's not the story of my life. The story of my life is the one that I decided how it's going
[0:53:47] SPEAKER_01: to go. You know, like I could say, No, no, no, the story of my life is not someone who grows up with
[0:53:52] SPEAKER_01: chronic pain and mobility issues and neurological issues. No, no, no. The story of my life is I'm
[0:53:59] SPEAKER_01: super healthy, and I'm a high achieving gymnast and a marathon runner. And I feel awesome all
[0:54:05] SPEAKER_01: the time. I have one of those bonkers immune systems where I never get sick. Yeah, blah, blah,
[0:54:09] SPEAKER_01: no, no, no, you don't understand. That's the story of my life. And it's like, What are you talking
[0:54:14] SPEAKER_01: about? Who are you arguing with? Reality is reality. The story of your life is the thing
[0:54:19] Unknown: that's happening. It's the movie you're watching. It's the movie you're living. It's only that. And
[0:54:25] Unknown: that kind has been great about that, too. Like, would you go into a movie and be like,
[0:54:31] SPEAKER_01: and people do this, right? Movies, TV shows? No, no, no, no, no, don't get together with that guy.
[0:54:35] SPEAKER_01: Get together with that other guy. Like, no, no, no, no. Like, it shouldn't be like this. It shouldn't
[0:54:40] Unknown: be like this. It's just what's happening. Well, it's got to like loop back to the conversation we
[0:54:46] SPEAKER_00: had on basic trust, I suppose, at a certain point, you know, because when you get to the position,
[0:54:53] SPEAKER_00: when you accept, okay, this is how it is, if you are blessed enough to have some trust in your
[0:55:01] SPEAKER_00: system, it can really become a wonderfully awake position because you go, okay, this is how it is.
[0:55:08] Unknown: And if it's happening, it's for my evolution. I may not be able to understand it. I may not be
[0:55:15] SPEAKER_00: able to make sense out of it. I may wish it to be different. All of that may be true. But
[0:55:23] SPEAKER_00: there's some rhyme or reason, right? There's some rhythm to these things that's
[0:55:31] SPEAKER_00: in some intelligence. And I think when that hasn't been something we've easily been able to access,
[0:55:37] SPEAKER_00: some measure of trust, which probably goes hand in hand with having a nervous system that gets
[0:55:42] Unknown: hijacked easily and has a lot of reactivity in it. Again, it goes back to then you're just the ego
[0:55:50] SPEAKER_00: mind. And the ego mind is part of the body and it's limited by time. And it thinks, I, Vanessa,
[0:55:58] Unknown: must solve this to save my body right here and now or else. And, you know, it goes into all sorts
[0:56:08] Unknown: of tailspins. And so, you know, it seems to me that it's all related, that it's like basic trust
[0:56:19] SPEAKER_00: and the capacity of the nervous system to be present with whatever is arising are just such
[0:56:25] Unknown: potent factors, not just on the awakening journey, but, you know, in our ability to heal.
[0:56:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just being alive as a human.
