[0:00:21] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:26] Unknown: I'm Brooke Thomas, and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:31] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're talking about being on the embodied spiritual path,
[0:00:35] SPEAKER_00: and what does that actually mean?
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_00: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:39] Unknown: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_00: All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes,
[0:00:44] SPEAKER_00: the bliss and the grit that is a human life.
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_00: This is a particularly, how do we embrace the bliss and the grit kind of episode.
[0:00:53] SPEAKER_00: The holiday season is still a recent memory,
[0:00:56] SPEAKER_00: and we all got a good dip into family personalities and patterns.
[0:01:00] SPEAKER_00: Usually, when we're on a spiritual path and we touch into the old family programming,
[0:01:05] SPEAKER_00: or really any time that we bump up against the more grisly bits of life,
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_00: it often brings up the questions like,
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_00: what is the point of these practices that I'm doing
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_00: if I can't meet this with some of the more stereotypical images of the spiritual person?
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_00: Why can't I be the unruffled person, or the perfectly equanimous one,
[0:01:26] Unknown: the endlessly compassionate one?
[0:01:29] Unknown: Is it possible that the more challenging aspects of life are supposed to affect us a lot,
[0:01:35] SPEAKER_00: to touch our hearts very deeply, to hurt even?
[0:01:39] Unknown: Why do we make suffering, both our own suffering and other people's suffering,
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_00: a problem, rather than just part of our alive nature?
[0:01:47] Unknown: What we may not realize when we begin these practices is that the root question
[0:01:51] SPEAKER_00: of the spiritual path is actually, are you going to live or not?
[0:01:55] Unknown: Are you really willing to be alive?
[0:01:59] Unknown: And instead of some magical finish line that you cross
[0:02:01] SPEAKER_00: and you become the good spiritual person,
[0:02:03] SPEAKER_00: perhaps aliveness is its own ongoing reward,
[0:02:06] SPEAKER_00: even in the challenging times.
[0:02:09] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, we would be delighted

[0:02:35] Unknown: Last thing, those of you who are new here and haven't gotten the memo yet,
[0:02:39] Unknown: sometimes Vanessa and I drop the occasional F-bomb.
[0:02:42] SPEAKER_00: So if you need headphones, go grab them.
[0:02:46] Unknown: OK, here we go.
[0:02:50] Unknown: Hello, Vanessa.
[0:02:53] Unknown: Hello, honey.
[0:02:55] Unknown: So we're back from holiday break.
[0:02:58] SPEAKER_00: We sure are.
[0:02:59] Unknown: Both on the show.
[0:03:01] SPEAKER_00: And in our lives, yeah, sort of.
[0:03:05] Unknown: And a repeating theme that's been coming up,
[0:03:09] SPEAKER_00: probably I'm not alone in this,
[0:03:11] SPEAKER_00: is that as I talk to people about their time with their family over the holidays,
[0:03:18] Unknown: people are expressing to me how much grief they felt in particular
[0:03:24] SPEAKER_00: about the way they see their parents living out their lives.
[0:03:28] SPEAKER_00: That there's this heartache.
[0:03:29] SPEAKER_00: You know, why are they so stuck in their habits?
[0:03:32] SPEAKER_00: Why are they so stuck in the way they nitpick at each other
[0:03:35] SPEAKER_00: or wear this mask of this particular habit or things like this?
[0:03:39] SPEAKER_00: So on the one hand, there's heartache about witnessing family patterns,
[0:03:43] SPEAKER_00: what it looks like, you know, 20, 30 years down the road.
[0:03:46] SPEAKER_00: And then on the other hand, is this question that I've had multiple people ask me
[0:03:51] SPEAKER_00: in the midst of these conversations, which is,
[0:03:54] SPEAKER_00: am I going to turn out that way?
[0:03:56] SPEAKER_00: Which I think we've all had that concern or that thought.
[0:04:01] Unknown: To which my answer is like, well, no, you know, first of all, we're not them.
[0:04:08] Unknown: But also, we're having these kinds of conversations
[0:04:12] Unknown: because we're curious and inquisitive and interested in the way
[0:04:18] SPEAKER_00: that we're living our lives.
[0:04:20] SPEAKER_00: We're curious and inquisitive and interested in the way we meet life,
[0:04:27] SPEAKER_00: which does not mean that we're emptying out all the badness in us
[0:04:30] SPEAKER_00: so that we can attain some perfect state.
[0:04:33] SPEAKER_00: It's just that we're genuinely curious about the way we relate to life
[0:04:38] SPEAKER_00: and the way life relates to us.
[0:04:41] SPEAKER_00: And like in these conversations, one of the constructs I saw,
[0:04:45] SPEAKER_00: which we've talked about before, but I think it's worth bringing it up
[0:04:49] Unknown: a little bit more highlighted, is that we still have this idea
[0:04:56] SPEAKER_00: that what we're headed for is peacefulness, you know,
[0:05:02] Unknown: or life lived as a cloud, where we, you know,
[0:05:06] SPEAKER_00: the image of sitting under the Bodhi tree
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_00: and that we're untouched by life, that we don't feel heartache
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: when we encounter our family or, you know,
[0:05:17] SPEAKER_00: when we go through something in our own personal lives.
[0:05:22] SPEAKER_00: And so how can we be in their presence
[0:05:25] Unknown: and only experience life as a cloud, you know?
[0:05:30] SPEAKER_00: Or how can we deliver to them peacefulness
[0:05:35] Unknown: so that they don't keep headbutting whatever wall they typically headbutt?
[0:05:40] SPEAKER_01: And so that we don't have to feel distressed because they're distressed.
[0:05:44] SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So that it doesn't push our pressure points.
[0:05:49] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, we're not the only ones coming off the holidays with families.
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_00: So I think that this is a pretty alive conversation.
[0:05:58] SPEAKER_00: And I want to frame it a little bit, that the interest that, you know,
[0:06:02] SPEAKER_00: because you and I spoke before the conversation,
[0:06:04] SPEAKER_00: that we both have is not so much like the Festivus airing of grievances, right?
[0:06:10] Unknown: Although fun.
[0:06:13] SPEAKER_00: But it's not so much like, why are they over there like that?
[0:06:16] SPEAKER_00: As it is that we want to kind of inquire about this image of the peaceful one.
[0:06:21] SPEAKER_00: This image of the still silent one.
[0:06:25] SPEAKER_00: And how some of our practices and constructs and teachings
[0:06:33] SPEAKER_00: can walk us down that road where we believe we should be delivered that
[0:06:38] SPEAKER_00: or and or be able to deliver it to others and where that gets tricky.
[0:06:44] Unknown: Yeah. I think.
[0:06:52] SPEAKER_01: This has been up for me in that sort of unformed way that it's up, right?
[0:06:58] SPEAKER_01: Like kind of swirling thoughts and feelings just mostly recently.
[0:07:04] Unknown: But it began a while back when I found my friend Clint in Sedona,
[0:07:11] SPEAKER_01: who I later led a retreat on with.
[0:07:15] Unknown: I'm sorry. Because when we went out into the land together
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_01: and Clint was adopted into the Lakota tradition 30 years back almost now.
[0:07:25] Unknown: And so practices, Native American spirituality and Earth based traditions.
[0:07:31] Unknown: And when I went out onto the land with him, he was praying to the creator.
[0:07:39] Unknown: And it was the most. Unusual and wonderful thing to witness, which is very funny to say.
[0:07:48] SPEAKER_01: I grew up in a Catholic tradition. Of course, we prayed and you pray out loud.
[0:07:53] Unknown: But this was different. It was like.
[0:07:58] Unknown: How a prayer might sound from Clint would be like, Creator God, you know, help my sister Vanessa.
[0:08:05] SPEAKER_01: She's feeling really down these days and and she could use some joy and some merriment.
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_01: So bring that to her heart and make her feel glad and look out for her family.
[0:08:15] SPEAKER_01: And you know, Creator God, like I'm going through some stress.
[0:08:18] SPEAKER_01: I'm going through some stress about work. And so if you might support me and help me know I'm loved and so on and so forth.
[0:08:25] Unknown: And then they would drum and he would sing and we would dance.
[0:08:31] Unknown: And then he'd say, OK, Vanessa, it's your turn to pray. And I'd be like, um, I'm just used to being quiet in my head.
[0:08:39] SPEAKER_01: Right. And there's this like weird almost shyness or trepidation about being out loud.
[0:08:48] Unknown: And I thought that was interesting. You know, and I've been meditating for years.
[0:08:54] Unknown: And meditation is such a silent thing and such a peaceful thing. Right.
[0:09:01] Unknown: And I felt this kind of. I don't know if internal divides, not the right word, but this internal exploration around this, you know, like.
[0:09:12] SPEAKER_01: Almost this hesitation on my on my body's part to like sing out loud and pray out loud and stop out loud.
[0:09:21] SPEAKER_01: And this movement towards no, no, no. The way I connect with God or life is through absolute stillness.
[0:09:29] Unknown: You know, and only that. And years ago, did you ever read Zorb of the Greek?
[0:09:35] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I know I talk about it. So I must have talked about you.
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_00: And you've also given me multiple copies. We used to share them back in Brooklyn.
[0:09:42] SPEAKER_00: So, yes, Zorb of the Greek was a part of our early foundational friendship.
[0:09:48] SPEAKER_01: For all of you listeners, one of the secrets of Vanessa is she loves Zorb of the Greek and the last temptation of Christ.
[0:09:56] Unknown: And why I love it was because the author, Nikos Kazantzakis, was going through this exact internal exploration.
[0:10:07] Unknown: He had a deep draw to Buddhism, probably the Zen tradition.
[0:10:14] Unknown: And he would wonder to himself through his writings, what was more profound or what was more spiritual to sit in a room staring at a wall,
[0:10:26] SPEAKER_01: as is the Zen tradition, meditating in silence or to be out in the world,
[0:10:33] SPEAKER_01: kind of like living full force, drinking in everything that life had to offer you, jumping up and down, dancing in gratitude,
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_01: screaming out to the ocean, praying at the top of your lungs. And I was always fascinated by it.
[0:10:48] SPEAKER_01: So recently I've been exploring this. And of course, given who I am when I explore this,
[0:10:55] SPEAKER_01: the kinds of questions I wonder is, what does it mean to be human?
[0:10:59] SPEAKER_01: Like, what is the point here of this manifestation that is human life?
[0:11:06] Unknown: Like, what's the game we're playing? And what are we pointing ourselves towards?
[0:11:12] SPEAKER_01: Is it an exalted state to be ever at peace? Like nothing ruffles you anymore.
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_01: You just almost barely care is the image that we used to get. Right.
[0:11:24] SPEAKER_01: Or, you know, you're so peaceful and you're overflowing with compassion.
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_01: But that's it. Complete non-attachment. You don't really care what happens.
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_01: And to me, you know, when I've been working with clients since Christmas,
[0:11:38] SPEAKER_01: having gone through my own holiday kerfuffles, as you would say,
[0:11:44] SPEAKER_01: you know, and I have clients who are like maybe they're looking to move or they're looking to make a change
[0:11:50] SPEAKER_01: or they were dealing with their parents upset and they're like, well, I'm not they're thinking I'm not supposed to care. Right.
[0:11:56] SPEAKER_01: Like my parents have hurt feelings or my parents are in these places where they're stuck or non alive.
[0:12:03] SPEAKER_01: And I am supposed to be very Zen about it and kind of above it. And I'm not supposed to care.
[0:12:08] Unknown: Right. Because to care would be to be codependent. And I'm like, maybe you're supposed to care a lot and still do it anyway.
[0:12:19] SPEAKER_01: Maybe you're supposed to care a lot, but not drown in it. Maybe you're supposed to care a lot.
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_01: And that what we're unhooking is not the tendency to care that other people are suffering
[0:12:30] SPEAKER_01: or to be moved in this alive manner, but rather the unhooked, the little hooks that say I can fix someone suffering because that's untrue.
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_01: Or it's bad if someone suffers and I should make sure they never have hurt feelings and all those tiny little hooks that aren't true.
[0:12:48] SPEAKER_01: But maybe the aliveness, the way that life moves us and impacts us is after all the whole point.
[0:12:58] Unknown: So anyway, I just said a lot. Good luck. Good luck. Ball lobbed to the other side of the court.
[0:13:08] Unknown: I was thinking about what you're saying about maybe we're supposed to care a lot, you know,
[0:13:15] Unknown: and I think that one of the other aspects of this is there's all of us here doing our thing, living our lives.
[0:13:25] SPEAKER_00: And we get to see how other people live their lives, including those very, very close to us, like our family members.
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_00: And it's almost in some ways, like if we want to make it a little simplified, it's like looking at a menu of human life.
[0:13:40] SPEAKER_00: You know, like if I were to talk with somebody who has a very high stress job that they hate, that they work 110 hours a week at,
[0:13:50] SPEAKER_00: I would see that on the menu of life and I'd be like, yeah, no, thanks. Not for me.
[0:13:55] SPEAKER_00: And with our family members, it's so much more intimate than that. It's so much more closer to the bone.
[0:14:02] SPEAKER_00: And because of that, it's also all of the wiring that we have in ourselves, ways that we can go, ways that we can relate to life,
[0:14:08] Unknown: because it's exactly what we've been shown and patterned after.
[0:14:13] SPEAKER_00: And so in some ways, it's like we can see these things that we find very heartbreaking ways that they operate.
[0:14:21] Unknown: And it's like this menu offering, like, would you like it? You know, and we can say no, you know, we can still have broken hearts for them.
[0:14:30] Unknown: But in many ways, I think that these things, they're in our lives so that we see them.
[0:14:38] Unknown: They're in our lives so that they touch our hearts and so that we can have a different kind of awareness about them.
[0:14:47] Unknown: And so I think a part of what you're pointing to is so sweet because and so hilarious, right,
[0:14:54] Unknown: because we can endlessly talk about the path and our practices and all these different things.
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_00: And really, like, what is the game we're playing here? It's called being a human being who's alive.
[0:15:08] SPEAKER_00: And like, we're all entitled to our fuck ups and we're all entitled to our heartbreaks and we're all entitled to our choices to do something different than that and our joy.
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_00: And like, that's it. You know, so the end game isn't unruffled.
[0:15:26] SPEAKER_00: There is no end game. It's just this ongoing.
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_00: Gorgeous exploration like I was watching.
[0:15:33] SPEAKER_00: I'll put the link to the video. Matt Konda to talk recently on happiness that I've watched a couple of times.
[0:15:38] SPEAKER_00: I found it really powerful.
[0:15:41] SPEAKER_00: And at one point, he was talking about how he used to be afraid of everything because life hadn't properly devastated him yet.
[0:15:50] SPEAKER_00: And then once he had been repeatedly and very profoundly devastated by life, then he broke him through to this different way of being.
[0:16:00] SPEAKER_00: And it just struck me, you know, he didn't say this.
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_00: But what what occurred to me is like as a as a person who identifies a lot with her own healing journey and as a person who also has a bunch of codependent wiring,
[0:16:14] SPEAKER_00: I can make things like devastation, heartbreak, mistakes, whatever you want to call them, regret.
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: I can make them mistakes, you know, problems to be solved.
[0:16:23] SPEAKER_00: But in so many ways, like we're all entitled to our devastation.
[0:16:29] SPEAKER_00: It's a part of what comes through for each of us.
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_00: We have a right to it. It's our beautiful.
[0:16:36] Unknown: Human life and we're all entitled to our heartbreak towards those as we see them devastated and we don't want them to hurt.
[0:16:43] SPEAKER_00: And we wish there were a different way.
[0:16:46] Unknown: Well, I think also perhaps part of the dilemma is this thing that we do where we make suffering a problem rather than just a part of the human experience.
[0:17:03] Unknown: You know, we don't want people to have hurt feelings like hurt feelings.
[0:17:10] Unknown: Who cares? And I don't mean to say that callously, although the words sound that way.
[0:17:17] Unknown: But, you know, that's part of our alive nature.
[0:17:24] SPEAKER_01: We live and we lose. We love and we surrender.
[0:17:28] SPEAKER_01: It's it's all a part of this human journey.
[0:17:31] SPEAKER_01: We don't get out of that.
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_01: Right. And being hurt or being upset.
[0:17:38] Unknown: As you know, as I know, as I think all of you listening notes, it's also motivated us to some of the most amazing things in our lives.
[0:17:48] Unknown: I think it's interesting lately, for some reason, it's coming into the foreground of my attention when I speak with clients and they feel like, oh, not this again.
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_01: I wish I just knew already.
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_01: How do I not choose that bad partner or how do I get out of this?
[0:18:06] SPEAKER_01: Or how do I get out of my own way to be as successful in my career as possible?
[0:18:12] Unknown: Or all of these different things. And of course we don't want to suffer.
[0:18:16] SPEAKER_01: You know, and I think that's a very sweet, tender, precious part of ourselves that doesn't want to suffer.
[0:18:22] Unknown: But at the same time, I'm like thinking, well, maybe it's part of it that you don't have all the answers yet.
[0:18:34] SPEAKER_01: You know, like Buddha had this moment where he was, you know, living this princely life completely sheltered from all pain and suffering.
[0:18:46] SPEAKER_01: And then he saw someone aging and he saw someone dying and he saw people hurting and he went off on this like, I don't know how many years, 10 to 15 year long journey where he suffered a lot.
[0:18:58] SPEAKER_01: He had a lot of internal anguish. He suffered physically before he found his enlightened state.
[0:19:06] SPEAKER_01: And Jesus Christ has a similar story. And if you look at people we may revere who have lived in our lifetime, I look up to people like Nelson Mandela and look at his journey.
[0:19:16] Unknown: And, you know, you're talking about Matt Kahn talking about devastation and almost everyone will have a story like that.
[0:19:24] Unknown: So I think to myself, where did we get this concept that if we're struggling, if we're confused, if we're stuck, if we're in pain, if our hearts are touched by people who are in agony, where did we get the concept that this is less spiritual or less wanted or less divine, less sacred, right?
[0:19:52] Unknown: Yeah, I mean, what if nothing's a problem, including our heartbreak, including our desire that, oh my God, I wish I were over this pattern already. What if none of those things are a problem?
[0:20:05] Unknown: That's what I'm thinking. And if we were to begin to see it through that lens, okay, it doesn't change the heartbreak, right? It doesn't change the ache.
[0:20:18] Unknown: You know, my beautiful, lovely mom was bouncing pain bodies faster than someone could bounce a paddle ball off a wall. And understanding that there's nothing wrong with my heartache doesn't necessarily make my heartache go away.
[0:20:35] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:20:36] Unknown: It's still there. However, there's a thing that we are prone to doing, where I feel the heartbreak, and then I say, I shouldn't have this heartbreak. It's bad that I have this heartbreak. This heartbreak is too much for me. This heartbreak is codependent.
[0:20:54] SPEAKER_01: You know, I'm not responsible for her feelings. And so I start to make it into a problem that I'm having a heartbreak, rather than a sign of my own aliveness, rather than a sign of something sacred and profound and beautiful and ever so human.
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_01: Something to work with. I mean, in the way that we could honor the elements in a way that we could honor this human journey. That's what I mean by work with it. I mean, put it in ceremony. You know, put it in prayer, put it in song, put it in dance.
[0:21:28] Unknown: So that as soon as we can start to come from the angle of maybe my own suffering and confusion and human experience are not a problem, but rather the whole thing, the whole journey, the whole point. Maybe when we can come from that angle, all of a sudden, openness happens, right? Because there's no resistance anymore.
[0:21:52] Unknown: Yeah, it's funny when we were talking with John Prendergast in our last episode. One of the things I wanted to bring up at the end, but we were like a little tight for time, you know, is that when we when we really do what we're describing here and what we talked about with him, where we don't reach for the self improvement project, how can I be a better and better inversion myself? And we also don't reach for the transcendental project. How can I live like a cloud? You know, that's a good question.
[0:22:22] Unknown: It's unaffected by anything. And instead, we find this real true lived experience middle way, which is as simple as just whatever your human life looks like at any given moment. But but really contacting it in a very genuine way, which I think John did a very nice way of leading us into that. What are we left with? And I would say that the thing that we that our separate self box against the most is that what we're left with is when we really land in that place,
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_00: is a certain kind of contentment. And contentment is kind of the wrong word. Because what I don't mean is like the sort of half sleepy smile, sort of blissy. And I also don't mean happy, like I'm so glad that I'm watching my parents suffer miserably and loathe each other.
[0:23:13] Unknown: Contentment is like, nothing to get grabby with. And nothing to turn your back on and nothing to wish away, including wishing things away. Like this hurts so much, right? I'm allowed to say it hurts so much. I wish this word here anymore. And that kind of contentment is like, I wish this word here anymore.
[0:23:43] Unknown: And that's what really landing in our lives looks like. And so one of the things I want to kind of circle back to a little bit that you brought up in the beginning is if that's what the path is, is like a really genuine contact with our actual lives, not the self improvement project, not the transcendental project, not making things go away.
[0:24:06] Unknown: What are our practices for? And I think it gets confused because we from our cognitive selves, we look at them from the outside, like if I looked at a room of Zen monks meditating in a room, or if I looked at a picture of that, I would go, oh, the the practice is for sitting still and being peaceful.
[0:24:29] Unknown: Or if we were going to look at indigenous traditions, I would say, oh, the practice is for praying to the ancestors, like you can kind of keep it on that very surface level. And it keeps you trapped from the real depth of it. And the depth of all practices is to land you in a human life.
[0:24:49] Unknown: So in the example of sitting still in a room and meditating, we're not doing what a lot of secular mindfulness marketing involves right now, which is like, how can I, how can I quiet my mind and be more productive? And everyone's heard me complain about this so many fucking times that I won't walk down that road too much.
[0:25:09] SPEAKER_00: But point being, what we're trying to do is, we live in a culture, and we're so conditioned to be racing along from thinking that we're separate selves and from our thoughts, that we don't have really time to contact the field of aliveness.
[0:25:30] Unknown: So when we're sitting still in meditation, we're not trying to bliss out or be peaceful or stop our mind from thinking, we're trying to give ourselves the opportunity to contact the field of aliveness that everything emerges out of. And you know, we can take that in a million ways when we talk about it with words, but the actual experience of it, I would imagine, is quite a lot like the experience of going through a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a meditation, a
[0:26:00] Unknown: meditation, you know, more indigenous practices, like you're talking about praying out loud to the ancestors, dancing, singing, they're trying to make contact with the alive field, you know, so they look quite different, but but same same. And if we keep them in their little boxes, just based on what they look like, we think that we're it's almost like we're acting out certain hobbies. But we're not we're trying to do, we're trying to come into our alive experience.
[0:26:30] Unknown: Yeah, you're making contact with what Jeannie's Andy would call like the vibrating field of aliveness. Or Judith Blackstone would call fundamental consciousness. Yeah. The other day, someone was talking to me about falling in love. And how do you open your heart again, after you've been hurt? And I think most people have some way of relating to this, these
[0:27:00] SPEAKER_01: sort of armors we have from opening up all the way. And that can be on every level, it can be allowing ourselves to fall in love, it can be allowing ourselves to be seen, allowing ourselves to exist, allowing ourselves to care with every inch of our heart, because it's also vulnerable. Because at the same moment, we're very well aware of loss, we're very well aware of the risk to
[0:27:30] Unknown: our safety physically and psychologically. So to me, when someone is wondering, how do I let go and love again, even though I've been hurt, it's like a question of how do I allow myself to live? You know? And I think it's a really interesting and potent question. Are we ready to live?
[0:27:55] SPEAKER_01: Hmm.
[0:27:56] Unknown: And I imagine that many of us start things like a meditation practice, because something's really hurting. And we just are aware of wanting something different, wanting a different experience, needing something different, needing not to hurt so much. And what we may not realize in that movement is that, for many of us, it's this way that we don't know
[0:28:24] SPEAKER_01: how to live without being subsumed by the suffering of life. Like we don't know how to come into direct contact with aliveness, which includes all of the bliss and all of the grit, right? All of the beauty and all of the crazy, as we say, we don't know how to do that. We don't feel we have the capacity or the skills or the support to do that.
[0:28:52] Unknown: And so we're getting subsumed by our own pain or our own fear. And what we don't recognize is that it's kind of a question of are you going to live or not? Really? Or are you going to fall asleep to life and walk in these kind of sleepwalker patterns or allow your pain bodies to start to call the shots, your habitual movements to call the shots?
[0:29:18] Unknown: One of the reasons why I love the indigenous traditions and I find myself called to them, and I found myself called to Reggie, who really lovingly integrates Buddhism with indigenous wisdom, is that for myself, I think there's a part that has always longed to just go to sleep, you know, go to sleep, don't feel anything,
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: numb out, have always been in a very deep kind of cellular level at odds with the idea of being alive because of this, because of the risk, because of the vulnerability, because of the pain I've felt.
[0:30:00] Unknown: And I think in a way, I don't know how to describe this. It's almost like the medicine is in exactly what we fear. Like aliveness has its own implicit reward. It is the thing. The most potent, meaningful, significant thing.
[0:30:24] SPEAKER_01: Yet we're so afraid of it. So we kind of turn that faucet off and we go into the world of concept and we try to set up our life and our goals and our strategies and determine what will make us happy. And we fall in love, but not too much. And not with the wrong person. We hedge our bets, right? You know what I'm saying?
[0:30:43] Unknown: And it's like we keep missing something, something that like, we'll make it all worth it, you know, we'll make the risk worth it. We'll make the fact that we're going to lose who we love worth it. We're missing it, but we don't realize that we were the ones who turned off the faucet.
[0:31:00] SPEAKER_01: So then we may go and sit on a cushion, which I still recommend. But what we don't realize in the background is that the movement is towards keeping that faucet off, keeping the calm, keeping the peace in a way that's not in direct relationship with aliveness. So I see it very easy to do.
[0:31:23] Unknown: And where I think some of the dilemma is, is that when you're on the cushion, and if that mechanism to turn the faucet off is, is really functioning in you in a big way, you can run into the problem we actually also spoke about with John, where you're in meditation and yet you're no more connected to life, capital L, then you are walking around, right? You're no more connected.
[0:31:49] SPEAKER_01: And so when I have spent time with indigenous practices and people devoted to them, there's something unbelievable about losing yourself in a moment about the kinds of dances and trance states and ecstatic moments and singing and stomping and dancing.
[0:32:12] Unknown: That is a celebration of life. It's almost like you can't have your faucet off and be shaking a rattle and jumping up and down and singing to God. It's almost like antithetical, right? Which is part of why it's always been scary to me. There's a surrendering of that armored protected state that says I'm just going to keep it all together. I'm going to keep it all together.
[0:32:40] Unknown: And I don't know recently as I have fallen in love with the practices and teachings of John Lockley, who is an African Sangoma or healer, medicine man. The most beautiful practice I think he has is listening to your own heartbeat. And there's more to it, you can dial into that if it calls to you.
[0:33:04] Unknown: But because your heartbeat is your aliveness, it's like surfing the wave of your breath and your heart and your blood and your bones. And it's this very deep reminder and reverence for the fact that we're fucking alive.
[0:33:18] Unknown: Falling in love is such a great example. So I want to kind of come back to that a little bit because we've all been there and we've all totally been there where we were like, if I'm just more careful, or if I just don't give as much of myself, it won't hurt as much if and when it ends. And we all can look in the rear view mirror and know that that is utter bullshit.
[0:33:45] SPEAKER_00: You know, a heartbreak and loss of a loved one always hurts, it always breaks your heart, no amount of turning off the faucet of how intimate you're going to be with that person protects you. And I would say, and I think we can all look in our own histories and trace this, I would say that the more that we did that, the more that we tried to protect ourselves or prepare in advance or, you know, hedge our bets or whatever,
[0:34:14] Unknown: that the more it hurt because we never got what we wanted, which was an experience of like intimacy and aliveness with people. And so we cut ourselves off from the life flow by trying to protect and all we get for it is more hurty, we get the opposite of what we wanted. We don't get the connection to flow. And so I think that that's
[0:34:44] Unknown: you know, important for us to like, go back and take a little gander at in our own lives.
[0:34:52] SPEAKER_01: Well, it gives a certain amount of insight to the same experience around being alive, because
[0:34:57] Unknown: it's exactly the same thing. We're kind of hedging our bets, we're using the analogy of playing the game of life, we're very strategically setting up our lives. Sometimes we don't quite realize that on a conscious level. But we are like, okay, I'm gonna invest in this and not too much in that and I'm not going to take this risk. It's like, for example, when I was very afraid of being trapped in relationship, I had a I had a
[0:35:26] SPEAKER_01: very deep fear of engulfment. So but I really wanted love. So unconsciously, the way that I solved that problem was I would choose men who have a deep love of freedom, even bigger than me, because those people never trap you. So then I'm hedging my bets, I can get the love, but I'm not going to get something that's going to engulf me. So I'll stay safe. But ultimately, what always wound up happening was that it was lacking that level of safety and intimacy. And so I
[0:35:56] Unknown: was truly craving. And so this is what we do. You know, I know, about a month ago, Brooke, Brooke and I were about to record and you and I were talking Brooke about what we were going to record on and it was right before the holidays. And I think I was talking about like, the unwillingness to live, you know, suicidality and all of these things.
[0:36:23] SPEAKER_00: Wanting to die. That's right. You texted me. What about wanting to die? I was like, that's a really cheery holiday episode.
[0:36:31] Unknown: So finally, I get to talk about it.
[0:36:33] SPEAKER_01: You got your wish.
[0:36:34] Unknown: Yes. But you know, I have noticed within myself and within many people that I talked to, that we can be remarkably skeptical about being alive. Remarkably skeptical. It's
[0:36:52] Unknown: actually not unusual for people to have things like suicidal ideation, which are suicidal thoughts. But moreover, when I went to grad school, we used to play this little game is probably not the right word. We would do this little experiment with ourselves, where imagine that you're standing on the ground. And I was to draw a line in the sand, so to speak, in front of you. And I was to tell you as you're standing on one side of the line, that on the other side of
[0:37:22] Unknown: the line was life. And that if you would just step over the line, you would be born into life. Can you can you get the picture? And I remember all too clearly being very hesitant about stepping over that line. And having clients feel the same way. That's a really interesting thing. Because on one level, I mean, I don't want to die.
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_01: Necessarily. But I also don't want to live. It's kind of like what Adyashanti would talk about when he speaks about that fist in the belly. Yeah, right. existential no. And it's like a big old fat no to death, but a big old fat no to life. Because, you know, to be alive means things change. They're out of your control. They're not predictable. You're going to lose things, you know, and you're ultimately going to lose your physical body. And the
[0:38:22] Unknown: bodies of those you love in some way, shape or form. And so, you know, we're kind of straddling this weird line. As humans, it's purgatory, you know, it's totally a purgatory. It's kind of hell on earth. Yeah. If you're aware enough, if you're aware enough, which every one of you listening is aware enough, that it is uncomfortable to be stuck in the world of concept and not experience and in every
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_01: single moment basis that life is utterly sacred and meaningful and profound and beautiful. And that is every moment of it, right, the ones where you're sad, the ones where you're happy, the ones where your heart's breaking, like, Brooke, I think back a lot to an exercise you offered in one of our recordings in December, where you said that you
[0:39:13] SPEAKER_01: imagine like you're 80 years old on that moment.
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_00: That your that your 80 year old self gets to be transported to the present moment and live it again.
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, I mean, I can't say that I want to necessarily go through my heartbreak again. But wouldn't there be something so profound in looking back on that moment? Yeah. Wouldn't it be so personal and important and rich and, and like amazing to think back to being that 30 year old who, you know, felt utterly in despair and yet had this glimmer of hope beginning to peek through your heart.
[0:39:52] SPEAKER_01: Like, yeah, these are the things that make life, life.
[0:39:57] SPEAKER_00: And you can have so much affection and admiration for even the hardest things, I think, in part in that exercise, because it's like, you know, you survived it. Right. Because like, that's what fear says is, I won't I won't survive this, like, it's over for me. But the only thing we don't survive is constricting our own access to life. And I don't say this from a place where I nailed it. You know what I mean? Like, that's why we have these conversations. It's a
[0:40:23] SPEAKER_00: ongoing process where we get to keep coming back to life. And, and honestly, I would say like, it's such a compassionate way that life interacts with us that it allows it to be a gradual unfolding that it allows it to to where you get to, you know, test out.
[0:40:44] Unknown: No, how does it go? Like, if I'm falling in love with someone, and I really let myself fall in love, like, I really let it in. And john brought that up to in our conversation, which I thought was so great, like, when you have these moments of landing or of realization, really let them in. You know, I think that there's a way that we can be like, okay, good. Got it. Like, but what if you're, I really like this person, I really hope it works out, you know, but what if instead, it was just like,
[0:41:15] SPEAKER_00: really feeling in your body, the sensations, which can be huge, when you're falling in love, like, and can feel overwhelming and like anxiety, sometimes. And also very blissy and very delicious. And what if you were just like, yeah, fuck it, like, I'm gonna do it really curious to see what happens. If I'm just like all in and
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_00: you know what, every other time my heart got dashed on the rock, so I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that'll happen again. I'm not gonna like do it so that I get the prize at the end where my heart doesn't get broken. I'm just gonna assume yeah, the heartbreak part is gonna come to but I would guess that there's so much affection, you know, like that 80 year old self being able to come back in a certain way. For having really said yes to something. You know, and in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the
[0:42:08] Unknown: what we started with in the example of like witnessing the lives that, you know, people in our families choose and them being things that might break our hearts. And that we can really say yes to that. You know, that we can really be sad and heartbroken and frustrated and confused and concerned for ourselves and just be like, yeah, you know, this is what life is showing right now.
[0:42:38] Unknown: It feels like this.
[0:42:42] Unknown: I think we can disregard the, the significance of meaning. You know, oftentimes we'll, we'll talk about happiness, you know, as a culture, we'll try to be happy. And we may seek for meaning in terms of purpose, like what's my career and what's my calling and things like this.
[0:43:02] Unknown: But I don't know that we have a very clear experience of what brings us meaning in life. Aliveness is a meaningful experience, not by any concept. It's not laid out by the brain like, you know, it's really meaningful. It's like experienced as right, as wholesome, as natural, and as multi-dimensional.
[0:43:32] Unknown: And meaningful to be really alive. And you can think about your peak experiences in your life. I mean, I can draw back on being on retreat in Sedona and meditating together and then praying together and then singing together and then dancing together and then connecting with the land.
[0:43:49] Unknown: And that really, it enriched and enlivened my experience of being a human being in a way that it gives me greater capacity to hold whatever pain and suffering is also coming through this container, right? Because this vibrating field is filled with all of this, all of this richness of human experience.
[0:44:14] Unknown: So I think we oftentimes forget that the meaning is found in our aliveness. And we are doing that thing I mentioned about shutting off, you know, kind of the hose. But then we're walking around with this existential angst. So I just think it's a really important and interesting question for all of us. Like, how are we going to live this human life?
[0:44:44] Unknown: I swear, I mean, gosh, I'm in my 40s. I've been meditating forever. It's amazing to me that we still, I still am asking myself that question, like, what makes it worth it? You know, what gets me up in the morning? What makes me eat so that I stay alive? Like, what is it that makes this all feel significant and worthwhile? I think it's a really interesting and important question to be exploring.
[0:45:12] Unknown: And then allowing the answer to come through in a very direct way.
[0:45:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and not from a cognitive, right, exactly. Because we always answer those questions from the lens of concept. And we're still left wanting.
[0:45:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I was listening to an on being interview today. Of course, I cannot remember his name, but I will put it in the show notes. But he was a Christian monk. And she asked him what he thought of world religions as institutions. And that was such a great answer. But it makes me think about what you're saying to about enriching the aliveness. And he was saying that he felt like all world religions were kind of like volcanoes that at one time,
[0:45:58] SPEAKER_00: they were just spewing red hot life force all over the earth. And then at some point, they hardened and stopped up and they became rocks. And anyone who would just walk by them would just see this big, tall, hard rock like thing. And they wouldn't know that at some point, it was spewing forth fiery life, you know, and that how can we find ways he was talking about the
[0:46:28] Unknown: world. And so I think it's really important to think about in our, you know, religions, if we affiliate with a religion, whether you know, Buddhism or Christianity, or what have you, to tap back into the magma, you know, to find the aliveness and to carry that forward into the world, you know, by being alive beings who realize the interconnectivity of all things. And it was a really gorgeous conversation. And, you know, I think that it's, it's normal if we're all a volcano, it's normal that that magma is going to be there. And so I think that's a really great answer.
[0:46:58] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:46:59] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:00] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:01] Unknown: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:03] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:04] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:05] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:07] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:08] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:09] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:10] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:11] Unknown: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:12] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:14] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:15] Unknown: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:16] Unknown: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:17] Unknown: I think that's a really good answer.
[0:47:18] SPEAKER_01: I love that.
[0:47:19] Unknown: That's a great explanation.
[0:47:22] SPEAKER_01: I guess it's important to put in a little caveat towards the end of the conversation.
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_01: That sometimes aliveness can be confused with drama.
[0:47:34] Unknown: Yes.
[0:47:35] Unknown: It can be confused with adrenaline rushes.
[0:47:40] SPEAKER_01: And everything I'm saying now is not to be in judgment of those things.
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_01: Wonderful.
[0:47:45] SPEAKER_01: You love jumping out of a plane?
[0:47:46] SPEAKER_01: Go for it.
[0:47:47] SPEAKER_01: You're in a dramatic relationship?
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_01: It happens.
[0:47:52] SPEAKER_01: So none of this is to be in judgment.
[0:47:54] SPEAKER_01: But we can confuse what it means.
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_01: Ultimately, with aliveness in the way that we're talking about it, it's almost like truly
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_01: being human, which means being open to all of the elemental forces of nature as they
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_01: without resistance, without having to groom them or manicure them.
[0:48:18] SPEAKER_01: Like my theme for this year for 2018 that had just occurred to me, I don't do this every
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_01: year but it was rewilding because we have all been domesticated.
[0:48:30] SPEAKER_01: Even in the way that we think that the desk in front of me is a solid object.
[0:48:35] SPEAKER_01: That's a form of domestication.
[0:48:37] SPEAKER_01: It's a conditioning.
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_01: And we have been kind of our throat chakras are shut down so we don't feel entitled to
[0:48:45] SPEAKER_01: screaming and singing out our prayers.
[0:48:48] Unknown: And we have been conditioned to make things under control and peaceful and groomed and
[0:48:56] Unknown: to revere that above states of chaos and destruction.
[0:49:03] SPEAKER_01: And so this sort of act of aliveness, it's not to even make things exciting because that
[0:49:11] SPEAKER_01: can be another form of just conditioning.
[0:49:14] SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah.
[0:49:15] SPEAKER_00: One of my favorite forms of bypass historically.
[0:49:18] SPEAKER_01: I could tell stories.
[0:49:23] SPEAKER_01: That's why the Brook and I song because we do it so much.
[0:49:27] SPEAKER_01: And I have met many people who use drugs and alcohol and again, and not in judgment of
[0:49:32] SPEAKER_01: it, but as a way to not be alive.
[0:49:34] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_00: And to do the like big la la explosive high drama, you know, like that is a bypass too.
[0:49:44] SPEAKER_00: It's a way of not contacting what's actually happening.
[0:49:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:49:47] SPEAKER_01: So what we're talking about is being in direct contact with our experience, which is the
[0:49:52] SPEAKER_01: heart of the kind of Vajrayana and embodied meditation paths that we're always speaking
[0:49:58] SPEAKER_01: about and very much a part of some of these beautiful indigenous paths where you're aiming
[0:50:05] SPEAKER_01: to strip away some of the domestication and the conditioning so you can experience the
[0:50:11] SPEAKER_01: sacredness in the vibrating field around you.
[0:50:15] SPEAKER_01: And my goal has just been to be able to meet that more and more in my life.
[0:50:20] SPEAKER_01: So even outside of these ceremonial moments or these moments of quote unquote practice,
[0:50:27] SPEAKER_01: you know, how can I welcome I had this dream the other day that someone had ripped a palm
[0:50:33] Unknown: leaf in half like a reed kind of in half and they said, yeah, like, yes, it's all one.
[0:50:40] SPEAKER_01: But the whole point of life is to find your way back together.
[0:50:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, so this idea that we have that we should have been born and we should know our
[0:50:48] SPEAKER_01: purpose and we should know what's meaningful and we should know how to make ourselves happy
[0:50:51] SPEAKER_01: and we should already be at peace and clear all of our karma.
[0:50:56] Unknown: It seems to me like it's skipping the whole point perhaps that the whole thing is to be
[0:51:05] SPEAKER_01: in this mystery and this chaos and this, you know, swirling vibrating field and to organically
[0:51:13] SPEAKER_01: and beautifully and slowly and profoundly discover the truth of it all.
[0:51:21] SPEAKER_00: Just to experience it is so sacred.
[0:51:25] SPEAKER_00: It's the whole point.
[0:51:55] SPEAKER_00: So I hope you enjoyed this video.
