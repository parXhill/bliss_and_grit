[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Brooke Thomas. I'll be joined
[0:00:11] SPEAKER_00: soon by my dear friend and co-host Vanessa Scotto. On the show, we're talking about being
[0:00:16] SPEAKER_00: on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is a real evolution
[0:00:21] SPEAKER_00: of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the
[0:00:26] SPEAKER_00: joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. We attempt to sort it
[0:00:31] SPEAKER_00: out for ourselves on the show. In today's episode, we're talking about a snippet of
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_00: Eckhart Tolle's book, A New Earth, that kind of caught my attention when I was giving it
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_00: a listen recently this year. He says that if we approach everything in life with either
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_00: one of these three, acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm, then we will essentially not
[0:00:54] Unknown: be suffering. And we will be here in the present moment. Now, I usually hate things
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_00: that feel like a blueprint to a happy life. However, this one's got some good bones. And
[0:01:05] SPEAKER_00: also Eckhart Tolle is just a very sincere and clear and grounded, beautiful teacher.
[0:01:11] SPEAKER_00: So Vanessa and I dive into the nuance of what we think exploring this way of being means.
[0:01:15] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, we would be thrilled if you could leave a review for us on iTunes
[0:01:20] SPEAKER_00: or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. And you can also go over to the website,
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_00: blissandgrit.com, to subscribe and hear updates about upcoming events that we might have coming
[0:01:30] SPEAKER_00: up. We do have something coming up, kicking off mid-June, mid to late June. So get on
[0:01:35] SPEAKER_00: the list if you want all the details. We're just about ready to unveil that. And the last
[0:01:41] SPEAKER_00: thing before we head into the conversation, we curse like sailors. So if there are kids
[0:01:45] SPEAKER_00: around, you might want to be wearing the headphones. Okay, here we go.
[0:01:50] Unknown: Hello, Vanessa. Hello, darling. I just want to clear the air first for us more than for
[0:01:58] SPEAKER_00: anyone listening. We're having a very Mercury retrograde kind of day. So you can roll your
[0:02:03] SPEAKER_00: eyes at the astrological bullshit as much as you want, but it's like multiple locations
[0:02:07] SPEAKER_00: and construction outside and internet fails. And so we'll see how this goes. We'll give
[0:02:13] Unknown: it our best shot. Yeah, we'll see. So I would like to talk about this year. Recently, I
[0:02:24] SPEAKER_00: listened to A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle. And I had given that a read a while back.
[0:02:29] SPEAKER_00: So I was kind of like revisiting. I love his work. I find him to be a very clear teacher
[0:02:34] SPEAKER_00: and a very sincere teacher. And there was this moment right at the very end of the book
[0:02:40] SPEAKER_00: where he got a little bit blueprinty, you know, like, which you wouldn't expect from him. He's
[0:02:44] SPEAKER_00: not one of these kind of here's the blueprint to live an amazing life types, you know, but he
[0:02:49] Unknown: actually broke down these three bullet points of if you're living from these places, you're living
[0:02:57] Unknown: a life that's free of suffering. And so I was like, Oh, you have my attention, you know, and I find
[0:03:04] SPEAKER_00: them fascinating. I'm going to say what they are soon, I promise. But I also like as I play with
[0:03:08] Unknown: them, because of course, it's something to lean into and explore. I find it's really true. And
[0:03:16] SPEAKER_00: of course, it's the very simple and yet not the not the easiest either, because it goes contrary
[0:03:25] SPEAKER_00: to most of our conditioning. So the three things that he said, like if you can approach any
[0:03:30] Unknown: situation in your life, with one of these three things, first acceptance, the other option,
[0:03:38] SPEAKER_00: enjoyment, and the third option, enthusiasm. So the way he defines acceptance, and we can get into
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_00: this a little bit too, and I'm paraphrasing, of course, I'm going on my memory of the book,
[0:03:48] SPEAKER_00: I don't have it in front of me. And acceptance is, of course, we have situations as human beings in
[0:03:55] SPEAKER_00: our life that are not the dream desired thing we would choose in the moment. The example he
[0:03:59] SPEAKER_00: gives in the book is if you're driving and you get a flat tire, now you don't want to have a flat tire,
[0:04:04] SPEAKER_00: you want to get where you were going to, but you have a flat tire. So this is a situation that you
[0:04:09] Unknown: can meet with acceptance, instead of spiraling off into all the storylines about why it shouldn't be
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_00: happening, and you're going to be late, and I can't believe and did I let AAA lapse and blah, blah,
[0:04:22] SPEAKER_00: blah. It's literally just this is what's arising in this moment. So okay, so what's the next step?
[0:04:27] SPEAKER_00: Pull on the shoulder of the road. Okay, what do I what's the next moment of acceptance?
[0:04:31] SPEAKER_00: Call AAA, what's the next one? You know, all these things. So acceptance is option one.
[0:04:37] SPEAKER_00: Not because these come in order, but based on whatever shows up. Enjoyment, he talks about
[0:04:43] SPEAKER_00: as what it is, but this very simple thing of just delighting in what you're doing, you're just doing
[0:04:50] Unknown: it because it's quite simply enjoyable. So the way I think about, you know, my son at night is a big
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_00: drawer that he loves to just make drawings. He's just not doing it because there's any assignment
[0:05:02] SPEAKER_00: due. He's not doing it because he's building his portfolio. He's just drawing because he enjoys
[0:05:08] SPEAKER_00: trying. And the third is enthusiasm, which he differentiates from enjoyment by saying that it
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: has this very powerful and clear momentum. And I believe the example he gave in the book was like
[0:05:22] Unknown: of archery. So this moment where you are pulling the bow, and if you shoot the arrow in a way where
[0:05:31] SPEAKER_00: it's like just right, and it's singing through the air, and it's heading for the bullseye,
[0:05:36] SPEAKER_00: and you can feel how you like got it just right, like that arrow moving through the air has this
[0:05:43] SPEAKER_00: graceful, easeful momentum on its own. So in some ways, I think he's talking a little bit about
[0:05:51] SPEAKER_00: a flow state, and he talks about it in relationship to like, basically letting your
[0:06:01] SPEAKER_00: life's gifts come through you as easily as possible. So I think that that's really
[0:06:08] SPEAKER_00: fascinating, you know, thinking about, well, okay, like, let's take it at face value. What if we try
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_00: or lean into approaching all life situations with one of these three options? Like, how does that go?
[0:06:20] SPEAKER_00: First of all, we're going to do it imperfectly because we're not enlightened beings. So
[0:06:25] SPEAKER_00: just accept that. Right, exactly. It's not going to be like, oh, okay, I know I did that for a full
[0:06:29] SPEAKER_00: 24 hours. No, like, that's not going to happen. It's going to be quite a lot of noticing how much
[0:06:37] SPEAKER_00: we don't do that, and how often we're picking other things out of the bag of possibilities. So
[0:06:45] SPEAKER_00: let's talk about those goodies a little bit.
[0:06:51] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's very confusing since we started this episode once and got interrupted.
[0:06:58] SPEAKER_01: And then some of the shit I was saying, you're added into the intro. I did.
[0:07:04] Unknown: Talk about it. Well, I'll dribbled into my brain. I think that we can. I think what helps is to start
[0:07:12] Unknown: to look at each component, right? And I don't know, acceptance stands out to me to be a really
[0:07:17] SPEAKER_01: interesting one. And we'd begun a conversation on acceptance in the fuck spiritual shame episode.
[0:07:27] SPEAKER_01: So I literally can't say that. Classy title. I know. We're high class. We're infants.
[0:07:38] Unknown: So there's this thing around like, okay, I think we can clarify what acceptance means,
[0:07:45] SPEAKER_01: right? Because into my head comes a couple of things. One, like, well, why should I accept
[0:07:49] SPEAKER_01: what's unacceptable? There are certain things that arise in the world that I don't want to accept,
[0:07:54] SPEAKER_01: right? I want to stand up against like certain kinds of treatment, for example, like, maybe,
[0:08:01] SPEAKER_01: maybe I'm walking down the street. This just came up for me yesterday when I was talking to
[0:08:06] Unknown: Judith Blackstone, like walking down the street in the summer in New York City,
[0:08:12] Unknown: elicits a lot of uncomfortable male attention. And so let's say I'm walking down the street and
[0:08:18] SPEAKER_01: someone cat calls me in a way that I find very disgusting. So when you use the word acceptance,
[0:08:24] SPEAKER_01: the first thing that pops into my head is like, okay, so warm bow to the guy who's cat calling.
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_01: And I don't have any problems with this. This is all just life, right? Like, okay, I have to accept
[0:08:39] SPEAKER_01: this. And I think that's where that word itself can start to run into problems. So do you want to
[0:08:46] SPEAKER_01: take a stab at saying what you think acceptance would look like in that moment?
[0:08:50] Unknown: In that moment, huh? I mean, so if we think about it, just in terms of staying inside of ourselves,
[0:08:57] SPEAKER_00: right, it's not about how I need to feel towards the guy inside myself, the things I would need to
[0:09:05] SPEAKER_00: accept are things like anger, and feeling vulnerable in the world, and feeling like an object in the
[0:09:13] SPEAKER_00: world, and how uncomfortable that makes me feel. So it's more like except in that example, it would
[0:09:18] SPEAKER_00: be accepting the things that come to the surface that feel uncomfortable, which we have very quick
[0:09:26] SPEAKER_00: habits about hiding and cloaking and suppressing. And of course, one of those cloaks would be things
[0:09:31] SPEAKER_00: like warm spiritual bow to the guy who just said this string of disgusting things to me.
[0:09:37] SPEAKER_00: He's God's child too, you know, and it's like, that's true, but it doesn't mean it's not disgusting.
[0:09:44] SPEAKER_00: Right? It doesn't mean it doesn't make me filled with rage. It brings up all kinds of feelings of
[0:09:50] SPEAKER_00: feeling unsafe. It hits on triggers about feeling like we're in a culture that does not have the
[0:09:57] SPEAKER_00: backs of women, and that keeps abandoning them more and more and what that feels like.
[0:10:01] SPEAKER_00: So those things would for me personally arise. And so then I have to the warm bow, not the fake
[0:10:11] SPEAKER_00: spiritual person bow, the loving bow would be towards those things inside myself, like yes,
[0:10:18] Unknown: yes, this these feelings are arising. And I think that just generally, yes, and revisit fuck spiritual
[0:10:26] Unknown: shame for a lot of us, but we we think that to be a good person is to be a person who is
[0:10:34] SPEAKER_00: walked on like it has this feeling in the body of what's very suppressive, it's very still,
[0:10:40] SPEAKER_00: it's almost like, like a swallowing something down like a holding your throat and your your jaw
[0:10:46] SPEAKER_00: tight for me, the feeling of like, of accepting what something that's actually unacceptable or
[0:10:51] SPEAKER_00: playing a role of being the person who's just cool with everything, because I'm spiritual,
[0:10:57] Unknown: it has this real, almost self annihilating feeling because it is because I'm not being
[0:11:04] SPEAKER_00: honest with myself about what I'm actually feeling in that moment. Whereas real acceptance is just
[0:11:11] SPEAKER_00: very, very sweet and loving. And certainly our mentor, Kieran Trace does a very good job of
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_00: distinguishing real acceptance versus face fake acceptance. And she talks about it as,
[0:11:27] SPEAKER_00: you know, one of the words she uses a lot is warm, that it's just very, very warm. And I think about
[0:11:33] Unknown: it in terms of like, warm in the way that like I snuggle my dog warm in the way that I kiss my son
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_00: good night, like that kind of level of like, just really warm. So in that example of uncomfortable
[0:11:49] SPEAKER_00: cat calls, it would be that level of like, Oh, oh, sweetie, I love you so much towards the I don't
[0:11:56] SPEAKER_01: feel safe in the world. I'm angry, all that stuff. Disgusted. You know, I had a friend of mine the
[0:12:05] Unknown: other day, and he was telling me that something had happened to him, it was something like
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_01: really stressful, really uncomfortable, you know, but he lives a pretty blessed and privileged life,
[0:12:16] SPEAKER_01: generally speaking, as most people who are listening to this do not all but and so when
[0:12:22] SPEAKER_01: he was complaining to someone, they sort of retorted with like, you should be grateful and
[0:12:28] SPEAKER_01: like, exactly the thing we were talking about on fuck spiritual shame. And it's like these kinds of
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_01: platitudes. And that's why I like these three things that Eckhart kind of broke down, because
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_01: all that really does for the person on the receiving end is really immediately create shame.
[0:12:45] SPEAKER_01: Yes, like, you shouldn't have the feelings you have, you shouldn't have the thoughts you have.
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_01: Now, if that worked, if saying to someone, Oh, Brooke, you know, you should be really grateful,
[0:12:55] SPEAKER_01: because you're quite a blessed person. If that worked, right, and suddenly I felt blessed,
[0:13:01] SPEAKER_01: genuinely felt it. Well, then that's wonderful. And maybe sometimes when certain spiritual
[0:13:06] SPEAKER_01: teachers say that to their students, it does because perhaps if Mugi saying it, it carries
[0:13:11] SPEAKER_01: the transmission of energy, and all of a sudden, someone in that moment recognizes a new aspect of
[0:13:16] SPEAKER_01: their experience. But by and large, what happens with these kinds of platitudes is we move into
[0:13:24] SPEAKER_01: what you said, like swallowing repression, shame, conditioning. And so it becomes this further
[0:13:32] SPEAKER_01: contortion. Yes, I go, I must not feel this, I don't have to feel that. And that's where like,
[0:13:37] Unknown: there's real nuance to understanding the process of self recovery. You know, as I think, so my
[0:13:43] Unknown: friend Shannon Thomas calls it Thompson, damn, always makes that up. Thomas, so it gets confusing.
[0:13:51] SPEAKER_01: She calls her stuff spiritual recovery. And it's like self recovery, you know, and I think
[0:13:56] SPEAKER_01: there's that level of nuance. So what I like about moving to acceptance is like,
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_01: not how it should arise. So that when someone cat calls you, I could say, well, Brooke, you know,
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_01: you should feel flattered. I mean, you should feel right, beautiful, you should feel at one,
[0:14:12] SPEAKER_01: you should feel compassionate, because that's just someone who's stuck in their thing. You know,
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_01: I can give you a lot of shoulds. As soon as we get to that level of should, we've created a
[0:14:23] SPEAKER_01: constriction within ourselves. Yeah, we've had to do something to become something, which is half
[0:14:30] SPEAKER_01: the problem since we think we have to be something, right? It's maybe all the problem. I don't
[0:14:36] SPEAKER_01: know. But it's pretty significant. I'm thinking the same thing. But you know, I'm all obsessed
[0:14:42] Unknown: with the objectification tip right now. But I'm thinking it might be. And anyway, so instead to
[0:14:50] Unknown: be able to meet it with acceptance, not as in this situation is welcome. I love that this man is cat
[0:14:58] SPEAKER_01: calling me. I have zero emotions or negative feelings about this. But that rather it's,
[0:15:05] SPEAKER_01: oh, and this too. Yeah. Okay, so now this is arising. So the man does this and that arises.
[0:15:12] SPEAKER_01: And then within me, what arises in response is, and then that arose. And okay, I can accept that.
[0:15:19] Unknown: And I can meet that with acceptance as well. Yeah. And then now I want to keep walking faster,
[0:15:26] SPEAKER_01: I want to say something back, or I want to whatever. And now that's arising. Yeah. And so
[0:15:31] SPEAKER_01: it's this much more nuance of not stamping something as okay, or not trying to make something
[0:15:37] SPEAKER_01: positive that doesn't feel positive, but this more genuine, like, micro moment to micro moment,
[0:15:46] SPEAKER_01: accepting of the spontaneous arising of human experience. Does that sound right?
[0:15:50] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. And it what you're describing is this process of you're staying in touch with yourself
[0:15:58] SPEAKER_00: in a very alive and moment to moment way. Because as soon as you're shooting, it's based on all
[0:16:05] SPEAKER_00: kinds of stories about the past and the future, and the way things ought to be. But if like what
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_00: you're describing, and now, and now, my throat feels tight, and now my face feels hot and red,
[0:16:16] SPEAKER_00: and now I feel anger. And now, you know, you're just, you're in this very welcoming relationship
[0:16:22] SPEAKER_00: to yourself, because you're basically just saying, yes, like, if you were talking to a young child,
[0:16:28] SPEAKER_00: like, yes, sweetie, tell me, tell me, tell me, you know, what, what is tell me, say yes more, like,
[0:16:34] Unknown: what, what else, and not in this way where you're, you know, throwing kerosene on it, and turning it
[0:16:42] SPEAKER_00: into an identity, because people can do that too, like, and now I'm the pissed off bitch who, like,
[0:16:48] SPEAKER_00: don't mess with me. And, you know, that's not in the moment either, because and then you might,
[0:16:53] SPEAKER_00: you know, notice on the wave after anger is this wave of grief, and then this wave of sleepy,
[0:16:58] SPEAKER_00: and then, you know, who knows, but you're, you're staying more in touch in a present moment way.
[0:17:04] SPEAKER_01: Well, what if we were to look at something that feels like even more unacceptable, like we were
[0:17:08] SPEAKER_01: to look at, like, Donald Trump, or like, going for something a little, yeah, we today. But yeah,
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_01: because well, what happens is this, like, we say these things, and then people are like, but really,
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_01: how do you do that in action, you know, like, then that's what the messages we get back is like,
[0:17:25] SPEAKER_01: yeah, it's all well and good. These are really nice ideas, and they even make sense. But I think it's
[0:17:30] SPEAKER_01: good to give examples, because then there's things that feel even more like, wait, but I don't accept
[0:17:35] Unknown: that I can't accept that about life. So let's just talk about it. Like, so okay. Let's just get
[0:17:44] SPEAKER_00: political. I could see here if you're feeling it a little. Okay, what's, you usually don't get
[0:17:50] Unknown: out around political things as much as I do. But it's a different time. So hot topic. It's like,
[0:17:57] SPEAKER_01: it feels so unacceptable to people, you know, to certain people. And if the converse was true,
[0:18:03] SPEAKER_01: and Hillary Clinton was president, that would feel unacceptable to a very big group of people, right?
[0:18:08] SPEAKER_01: This was a very polarizing place. And to whoever is responding, it can feel unacceptable. So
[0:18:15] Unknown: let's say your your leader, that be is an unacceptable thing to you. You're not going
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_01: to meet it with enjoyment. And you're not going to meet it with enthusiasm, really. Right? What? How
[0:18:28] Unknown: do you meet that with acceptance? What would that look like? For me personally, because I can't say
[0:18:34] Unknown: it's about anyone else. Um, yeah. I mean, it's a few things, like, first of all,
[0:18:46] Unknown: one of the things I keep having to come up against when something goes wrong, and I'm grieving what
[0:18:52] SPEAKER_00: feels like the loss of my country, you know, grieving the loss of democracy, for me, and
[0:18:59] SPEAKER_00: is, if it's about him, and I'm like, out there, the problem, the problem, the problem, I have to
[0:19:05] SPEAKER_00: notice that he's not in the room with me. And that while he is affecting culture,
[0:19:15] Unknown: that so am I. You know what I mean? Like, there's a certain way of, I have to get clear on the power
[0:19:24] SPEAKER_00: stuff and the way that we energetically inflate certain things. So he's energetically inflated,
[0:19:32] SPEAKER_00: like, that's the way his persona is, and happens to be the most powerful person, arguably, on the
[0:19:38] SPEAKER_00: planet. Putin, maybe, is more powerful. But it's close. Um, crap, I'm so mad at you for taking
[0:19:45] Unknown: this into a political place. So what I'll notice, like, let's say, okay, so he just fired Comey,
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_00: and it's like, oh, my God, oh, my God, we do not live in a democracy. So I have to notice the Oh,
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_00: my God, oh, my God, we don't live in a democracy. And then I'll notice myself watching pain body TV,
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_00: which is Facebook for me, you know, and I'm obsessively doing that. And I'm reading the
[0:20:10] SPEAKER_00: articles. And I'm wondering what's who's saying what. And I'm wondering, like, where's the call
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_00: for sanity on both sides of the aisle? Just people like, aren't there enough people in our
[0:20:18] SPEAKER_00: government who love democracy that they care about that more? Like, it's just, just democracy. It
[0:20:23] SPEAKER_00: doesn't matter if you want him to be president or not. Isn't there isn't there like an instantaneous
[0:20:29] SPEAKER_00: move towards like, we actually have a constitution in place or whatever. So I noticed myself
[0:20:36] SPEAKER_00: doing that. And that's a way for me to stay hooked in the narrative, right? There's no problem
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_00: with it. It's fine. But it's really good for me to notice that I'm doing it because autopilot happens
[0:20:48] SPEAKER_00: right quick. And I'm doing it to avoid feeling what I'm feeling actually, you know, not just to
[0:20:57] SPEAKER_00: throw kerosene on things. But it's a it's a cloaking mechanism, because it's the opposite of sitting
[0:21:04] SPEAKER_00: with what's actually arising. And I would say, you know, that, for me, and we'll see where it goes,
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_00: because who knows, but in the present moment, when I sit with what's arising, it's helping me to
[0:21:16] SPEAKER_00: unravel a lot of my own personal conditioning. Because of course, it's not just about this person
[0:21:20] Unknown: I've never met way over there doing these things. It's about how it tugs on me individually. And
[0:21:27] Unknown: has those things unravel? There are more opportunities that show up for me to that
[0:21:35] SPEAKER_00: are in alignment, like with the way I can live my life, which is totally different than just
[0:21:40] SPEAKER_00: I was going to say numbing out, but it's more like raging out on
[0:21:43] SPEAKER_00: flipping through, yeah, flipping through all the articles. So it's not an ignoring like,
[0:21:48] SPEAKER_00: it's going to be fine or, you know, everything has its moment or so I'm not bright siding it.
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_00: But I'm noticing like, okay, this is my pain body in action, like, this is my predilection
[0:22:02] SPEAKER_00: is to do it this way. And if I actually sit with the pain, it's just a completely different
[0:22:08] SPEAKER_00: experience. And it's much more useful, it actually becomes fruitful.
[0:22:11] SPEAKER_01: By sit with the pain, we could use the word accepting. Right. Yeah. Right. So you're meeting
[0:22:16] SPEAKER_01: with acceptance that pain arises. I mean, I think part of why I looked at like the political level
[0:22:21] Unknown: of it is that it's, it feels important to differentiate between acceptance and pacifism.
[0:22:28] Unknown: Yes, right. Right. That no matter what the circumstance you're dealing with, you know,
[0:22:35] SPEAKER_01: where I just use this as one example, because a lot of people are relating to this right now,
[0:22:39] SPEAKER_01: and it feels big, and it feels like something people have to take action on, you know, it's
[0:22:43] SPEAKER_01: like, okay, so if there's a guy cat calling me on the street, that's very annoying, it's very
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_01: disgusting. I actually personally I am one who wants to take action on those things. But at the
[0:22:54] SPEAKER_01: same time, I could really gather perspective and say, what is that really going to do? Right? Like,
[0:22:58] SPEAKER_01: there's no real problem here, it's not going to change the world. And it's very easy to just
[0:23:02] Unknown: move into a passive stance on it. When you get to these bigger topics, it starts to pull out
[0:23:10] SPEAKER_01: the conversation around passivity and acceptance, I think more clearly. So that to accept something
[0:23:18] SPEAKER_01: is not an external action, right? So this is what you were saying prior, it's like, we don't have
[0:23:22] SPEAKER_01: to accept external circumstances is in stamp of approval, I agree with you, I'm so happy you're
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_01: happening. Yeah, or it's all going to be okay in the end. Yeah, yes. And we don't have to accept it
[0:23:34] Unknown: as in, so I do nothing about it. So here I am, and you all are reacting, and I'm just in acceptance,
[0:23:41] SPEAKER_01: oh, I'm shanti shanti, I'm all love and, and everything's happening around me, but the world's
[0:23:46] SPEAKER_01: an illusion. Because that's the next level at which people could interpret the concept of
[0:23:52] Unknown: people could interpret the concept of acceptance. But rather, it's like, in part, it's accepting a
[0:24:01] SPEAKER_01: fact, you know, like a reality. So, you know, for example, like, he is in fact president.
[0:24:08] SPEAKER_01: That's a reality. A certain percentage of people voted this way, that's a reality. Other people
[0:24:14] SPEAKER_01: voted other ways. That's reality. There are multiple belief systems on this. That's a reality.
[0:24:20] SPEAKER_01: So we're not contorting anything. Yeah, we're not jumping into that land where you and I had talked
[0:24:25] SPEAKER_01: earlier when we talked about political stuff about how easy it is to make everyone bad who voted for
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_01: him. Yes, right. And everyone good. And that's all not true. Yeah. And we're just watching like the
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_00: shame demon put its tentacles everywhere, everyone on every side. It's fast been really
[0:24:42] SPEAKER_00: fascinating for me to watch like, whoo, we're finding fresh ways to shame fire hose people
[0:24:47] Unknown: all over the place on every side of every debate, which isn't acceptance. No, that's all
[0:24:54] SPEAKER_01: categorizing reality to make it feel safer to you, right? Whether it's creating your identity,
[0:25:00] SPEAKER_01: as you said, well, I'm this bitch who's going to rebel and not take shit. And now that makes me
[0:25:04] SPEAKER_01: feel comfortable. And as the bitch, I'm going to like, judge other people, and I'm going to do a
[0:25:08] Unknown: divisive I and you and, and that's how I find safety. So I'm going to move that way. And that's
[0:25:14] SPEAKER_01: not actually an acceptance internally. Yeah, it's not an internal recognition of what's arising.
[0:25:21] SPEAKER_01: It's also not an internal recognition of what's arising to be like, some people are good. And
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_01: some people are bad. And like, this is the biggest disaster that's ever happened in history. And like
[0:25:30] Unknown: all of these different ways, or everything's just okay. Right. So it's it's like, how do we sit with
[0:25:38] SPEAKER_01: reality, which is probably where accept acceptance is so hard. In fact, like, yeah,
[0:25:43] SPEAKER_00: so masterful. It's about not arguing with reality. It's just meeting it. And that's going to be
[0:25:49] SPEAKER_00: individual, of course. You know, for me, the it's like, what are the what are the really,
[0:25:54] Unknown: really, really sore spots in me about this person's presidency, and it's all related to just
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_00: pushing on these very, very, very tender, very old places about sociopaths, abusive power,
[0:26:12] SPEAKER_00: women being non people, you know, I could go on and on these are things that are that are personal
[0:26:17] SPEAKER_00: to me. And they're personal to some other people too. But it's like, it's only useful if I can feel
[0:26:22] SPEAKER_00: it pushing on my very, very tender wounded flesh that goes back many years, and then I can love it,
[0:26:31] SPEAKER_00: right? See it. And none of this shit is as tidy as it sounds. It's like it's a constant unfolding
[0:26:38] SPEAKER_00: and a and a sitting with and like, and a loving not sitting with like sitting on and not sitting
[0:26:44] SPEAKER_00: with like fondling the cathartic feelings, but just to literally like, oh, God, that's really
[0:26:51] SPEAKER_00: okay. And then it can move sometimes. And it's like a relief, a relief floods through. And then
[0:27:00] SPEAKER_00: sometimes I have a much harder time and I don't get to relief and I'll spend days or weeks,
[0:27:05] SPEAKER_00: not with relief, you know, and then it moves. So it's like, it's just, I think that's one of
[0:27:10] SPEAKER_00: the things about being human when you're in, you know, when you're talking about being in a
[0:27:13] SPEAKER_00: particularly uncomfortable situation, whether it's about large scale things like who's in power,
[0:27:20] SPEAKER_00: or things in your personal life, you know, terrible diagnoses, or the loss of a loved one,
[0:27:26] SPEAKER_00: or they're taking your house, you know, all these things that we think about as being very, very
[0:27:30] SPEAKER_00: hard human experiences. We're all going to meet them in these very individual ways and imperfectly
[0:27:38] Unknown: because we're humans. There is this, I have so much to say on this topic of acceptance, so I'll
[0:27:44] Unknown: won't overdo the topic. But like, there was this article I was reading, someone shared this morning,
[0:27:51] SPEAKER_01: and it was about dying. And they were talking about the number of medications that people take
[0:27:58] SPEAKER_01: in the last six months of their lives, and also how most people wind up like in hospice or hospital
[0:28:03] SPEAKER_01: care, even though if you ask people, that's not where they want to be, that's not where they want
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_01: to die. And they were saying that really the biggest problem that they noticed is lack of
[0:28:13] SPEAKER_01: conversation around death and lack of palliative care. And that if you brought those in, actually,
[0:28:19] SPEAKER_01: the percentage of drugs and the number of times they have to be in a hospice or hospital greatly
[0:28:24] SPEAKER_01: goes down. And it just got me thinking about like those levels of accepting, like meeting life as it
[0:28:32] Unknown: is, that when we don't, there's like this contortion, right? So if I can't accept that I might die,
[0:28:40] SPEAKER_01: or that my loved one might die, I can't have that conversation. And if I can't have that conversation,
[0:28:46] SPEAKER_01: then we have to be in agreement that we're going to fight to live in this certain way.
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And then that creates its own movement and then another movement and
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_01: excessive suffering all around. Yeah. And it's not to go into the passivity of like, oh,
[0:29:02] Unknown: ho hum, there's nothing we can do. It's like, it's just accepting the reality of the different things
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_01: that might arise in any moment. So like, completely diversely off topic. The other arena I was thinking
[0:29:16] Unknown: of was like, when someone cheats on you. So for example, we've seen this where someone cheats on
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_01: you, I'm going to talk about it as a man, but women do it too. You beautiful men, we're not
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_01: marginalizing you or judging you, but I'm just going to talk about a man because it's my personal
[0:29:32] SPEAKER_01: experience. So it's like, when you notice that someone cheats on you, maybe your boyfriend,
[0:29:37] SPEAKER_01: and then sometimes you'll see women get mad at the woman, but not at the man.
[0:29:41] Unknown: It's like the safe position to take. Yeah. Yeah. So there's this safe position and it's this,
[0:29:47] SPEAKER_01: it's this non acceptance of all of the variables that came together to create something,
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_01: which are many, right? And we don't have to sit in judgment to sit in acceptance. It's like,
[0:30:00] SPEAKER_01: oh, there are all these variables that arise that created this scenario, this movement,
[0:30:07] SPEAKER_01: you know, even if we got back to politics, it's like, some people find it useful to talk about
[0:30:13] SPEAKER_01: like, well, this all arose out of the collective. So it could be useful to just accept like, well,
[0:30:18] Unknown: what part do I play in this, if any, you know, and just look at that and hold that in acceptance that
[0:30:25] SPEAKER_01: everything is kind of arising out of this, these co conditions. And we don't have to push them away.
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_01: We don't have to judge them. We don't have to simply solve them and put them into a box. It's
[0:30:36] Unknown: like, what we're looking for is this experience of truth. And you'd said before relief. And I was
[0:30:43] SPEAKER_01: thinking like, yes, I've worked with clients and myself long enough to know that even when people
[0:30:50] Unknown: get quote unquote, hard truths, there is this immediate experience of peace and relief. Yeah.
[0:30:59] SPEAKER_01: Right. And that's the kind of like, zing of reality. Like, if you want to know, am I in this
[0:31:05] Unknown: acceptance that Eckhart Tolle is talking about, at least for me, the closest I've come to it
[0:31:12] SPEAKER_01: is this like, kind of relief and like, okay, well, here's what's up. Yeah. Right. And it's not a
[0:31:18] SPEAKER_01: judgment. It's not a good or bad. It's not this can't be up. This person can't be my president.
[0:31:23] SPEAKER_01: My boyfriend can't have cheated on me. My girlfriend can't have done this. This person
[0:31:28] Unknown: can't be dying. It's not a pushing away. It's just, oh, here's what's up. Yeah. And there's
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_01: this way that you kind of really settle when you get the resonance of truth. Yeah, as relief. I
[0:31:43] SPEAKER_00: mean, we've talked about it and we will always re talk about this because this is the crux of
[0:31:48] SPEAKER_00: the thing. Right. But we've talked about it using Martha Beck's term clench on clench,
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_00: Karen Trace's term delicious. Yes. Which is the relief, the like clarity movement.
[0:32:01] SPEAKER_00: And it's profound. And I do think that like for everyone listening, you can probably think of a
[0:32:05] SPEAKER_00: time in your life when you finally face something you had maybe been avoiding. And it was relieving,
[0:32:13] SPEAKER_00: you know, something about, you know, the big things that are hard for us to deal with health,
[0:32:20] SPEAKER_00: home, money, relationships, like one of those things that had been really on the little hamster
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_00: wheel running away from and going nowhere. And then finally you were like, I'm going to get off
[0:32:31] Unknown: the wheel because I, I'm going to really accept what the truth is here. And that is very relieving.
[0:32:36] Unknown: That's acceptance. That's acceptance. And once you accept, that's the funny thing. Once, once
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_01: you're like sitting with truth, all of a sudden new creative possibilities arise. Right. Because
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_00: you're not telling yourself a story about the little tight walls that are in around you. And
[0:32:52] SPEAKER_00: you're like, oh, oh, okay. You know, there are all these options. Right. And it invites a different
[0:32:58] SPEAKER_01: movement. And I think what we can notice from me, like bludgeoning through these examples,
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_01: was that like, what I was trying to get at is when we move from non-acceptance, we could call it fear,
[0:33:11] SPEAKER_01: we can call it resistance. But when we move from non-acceptance, it creates like a little
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_01: distortion. And then that distortion tends to create the next distortion and the next distortion.
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_01: But when we move from this place of, at ease or acceptance or reality or truth,
[0:33:29] Unknown: there's this like clarity in the movement that tends to create a little more freedom actually.
[0:33:35] SPEAKER_01: And then that creates a movement that's born from a little more freedom. So then that tends to
[0:33:39] SPEAKER_01: invite something forward that has a little more freedom in it and a little more ease in it.
[0:33:45] Unknown: And so, yeah, I don't know. Yes, acceptance. No, you're not.
[0:33:53] SPEAKER_00: So enjoyment. Yeah. Enjoyment is, I don't know, in many ways, I feel like it's the simplest thing,
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_00: but it's also something we don't do that much. Like I even, because I'm a body person, I'm
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_00: fascinated how we've turned one of the most enjoyable things in the world, which is moving
[0:34:09] Unknown: our bodies into like, ugh, the worst. You know, like everyone has turned it into, first of all,
[0:34:18] SPEAKER_00: fitness. So it's this thing that has a separate category. It's not just being in your body and
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_00: moving around in the world. And then second of all, fitness has got this totally self-abusive
[0:34:27] SPEAKER_00: movement, you know, where it's like, first of all, you're doing it to get to some future tense goal
[0:34:31] SPEAKER_00: about how you're going to be. And then you're doing it in this way that not everyone, obviously
[0:34:36] SPEAKER_00: not everyone, but I think if we can talk about a cultural trend, there's a cultural trend towards
[0:34:41] SPEAKER_00: harming yourself in the name of health. And it's just bonkers to me. I'm like, can we all stop
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_00: pretending that like doing four Ironmans a year is a health choice you're making? It's not a health
[0:34:53] SPEAKER_00: choice. It's compulsive behavior, you know? And, or like Biggest Loser, which I could complain about
[0:34:58] Unknown: forever. That stupid, awful TV show is such a like snapshot of where we all culturally about bodies,
[0:35:07] Unknown: you know, moving, being in your body is like one of the most pleasurable things in the world.
[0:35:17] SPEAKER_00: And if you do it in an embodied way, meaning you're making contact with yourself,
[0:35:22] Unknown: instead of just doing your grocery list or shaming yourself about your thighs while you do
[0:35:25] SPEAKER_00: box steps or whatever, you experience that it's this like really, really, really delicious
[0:35:32] SPEAKER_00: thing. And then your body gives you information like today, I'm tired. I'm done with the hike at
[0:35:37] Unknown: this point. And then the next day, it's like, sprint now, jump, feel so good. But not this like
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_00: punitive thing. So enjoyment is really straightforward. And yet, we're not so loving
[0:35:55] Unknown: it in many ways. Like we let's we talked about this before in other episodes too, where we, we can be
[0:36:01] SPEAKER_00: driven towards happiness as a future tense goal. That's really different than enjoyment, which is
[0:36:09] SPEAKER_00: has to happen now. And of course, Eckhart Tolle is the author of The Power of the Soul. And so,
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_00: which is has to happen now. And of course, Eckhart Tolle is the author of The Power of Now. But it's
[0:36:17] SPEAKER_00: great that he came up with these words. Yeah, that really land you in what's happening in the moment,
[0:36:25] SPEAKER_00: you know, enjoyment is something that arises naturally in the moment when you're doing
[0:36:29] SPEAKER_00: something enjoyable. And you keep following the thread of is it enjoyable? Is it enjoyable? Do I
[0:36:34] Unknown: still like it? Do I still want to make this drawing or walk on this trail or have coffee with this
[0:36:42] Unknown: friend or whatever? Well, we also did record an episode on the fear of joy. So there's those
[0:36:49] SPEAKER_01: things. But since lately, I'm mostly on the rant of objectification. You're like, I'm gonna bring
[0:36:56] SPEAKER_01: it on around to that. Just gonna keep talking about that shit. Because that's what's up for me.
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_01: Because I feel like, okay, well, what you were talking about, let's say with exercise, you know,
[0:37:06] SPEAKER_01: how moving your body is this very natural, delicious thing, we see it cross culturally,
[0:37:10] Unknown: like, for example, globally, cross culturally, people dance. Yeah. Right. And they dance for
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_01: spiritual reasons. And they dance for exercise reasons. But they dance for really pleasure,
[0:37:24] SPEAKER_01: like for joy, they dance because they can't help but dance, right? Like, it's like you're in this,
[0:37:29] SPEAKER_01: you're alive and you dance like that's why humans dance, we move. So I was thinking about that. And
[0:37:35] Unknown: then I was thinking about this idea that we can make even that such a thing like, well, I have to
[0:37:40] SPEAKER_01: dance well, and I have to look good. And I have to, you know, get to the gym, and I have to be fit
[0:37:47] SPEAKER_01: and all these things. And I'm starting to think about that's just, it's like the self objectification.
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_01: Yes, it is. I mean, a lot of what we're getting at, even with the shame episode, and this episode is
[0:37:58] SPEAKER_01: like, just quit thinking you have to be anyway, and just be the way you are and like, let that be
[0:38:03] SPEAKER_01: okay. And that's a really apparently very hard thing for us to do. That is yes, masters level
[0:38:09] SPEAKER_00: stuff for sure. It's constantly unfolding. It's like, and now here's another layer of how I wasn't
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: letting me be really truly myself. Oh, oh, look, oh, wait, there's only 40 million more.
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_01: It's like, okay, so what would sexy be? And then we think about like, what would sexy be? And then
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_01: I'll just try to be sexy. But like, that's not sexy to try to be sexy. No, it emerges naturally.
[0:38:33] SPEAKER_01: Be the sexy you are like whatever that is that is a natural rising for you or like, how can I be
[0:38:40] SPEAKER_01: happy? Well, you can't try to be happy. You can only be happy. Happiness is arising for you and
[0:38:49] SPEAKER_01: God, we tie ourselves up in like pretzel knots, don't we? And it's like, so easy to do. I
[0:38:55] SPEAKER_01: definitely still do this. It's just like less and less than I used to. But there's little ways where
[0:39:00] SPEAKER_01: you still think there's something I have to be like, how am I going to live my life with purpose?
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_01: Well, you don't try to figure out how to live your life with purpose. You just let purpose rise.
[0:39:12] SPEAKER_01: Because when you get out of the way, turns out all these things, since they're a part of the
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_01: dynamic human spectrum of experience, they just arise, you know, like waves or like fireflies in
[0:39:24] SPEAKER_01: the sky, like they just come and they pop and they're and they don't last. And then they come
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_01: back again. And it's the way that it works. I'm thinking about, you know, given that we're human
[0:39:35] SPEAKER_01: beings, and we have conditioning, and we live in a world that is chock full of other human beings
[0:39:42] Unknown: with their stupid conditioning. All compassion. No, but deep where we're human beings. Lots of
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: conditioning getting triggered by other human beings with lots of conditioning. We're all just
[0:39:58] SPEAKER_01: super and skillful. Most of the time, no one's meaning to do anything wrong. But there it is.
[0:40:03] SPEAKER_01: And, and we're getting triggered, right? But that conditioning that other people have,
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_01: and the conditioning we're developing, ultimately, it teaches us how to be. And that's what
[0:40:14] SPEAKER_01: conditioning is. It's like a lesson in how to be be like this. Don't be like this. This is safe.
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_01: This is good. This is what happy people do. This is what spiritual people do. And so we just kind of
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: keep heaping on these ideas about how to be which is taking us farther away from being.
[0:40:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And then we become our own objects. We objectify ourselves as if there's some way to be
[0:40:40] SPEAKER_01: that is other than the natural arising that is Vanessa, Vanessa Ng, and that is Brooke Booking,
[0:40:46] SPEAKER_01: and, you know, all of you people out there doing your thing. Right. So I think that enjoyment
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_01: is this very natural state where it's not an idea about what should I enjoy. It's not an idea about,
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: oh, well, Brooke said she enjoys, you know, chocolate, like, let me try that. Or she likes
[0:41:06] SPEAKER_01: Rick and Morty. Like, let me watch that. It's like, do not do that. You will not like me anymore.
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_01: Do not do that. Do not do. It's really this very natural place of what bubbles is joy.
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_01: And it's a moment by moment discovery. Like right now, like what would feel really joyful?
[0:41:28] SPEAKER_01: What would feel like? And that's where I think Kieran's words delicious. Yes,
[0:41:33] Unknown: stand really strong, right? Because they're so visceral. So I do think that even knowing
[0:41:40] SPEAKER_01: what can feel enjoyable can be tricky because we're so used to living as our own objects.
[0:41:46] SPEAKER_01: We're so used to thinking that we can try to be a certain way or that we should do a certain thing
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_01: that to relax into. There's nowhere to be. There's nothing to do. There's no one else
[0:41:58] Unknown: to try to emulate, but rather just have your delicious body, you know, come forward like
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_01: a Mary Oliver poem, like let your delicious animal body. Yeah, let the soft animal of your
[0:42:12] Unknown: body love what it loves. Boom. That's it. That's the joy. It's like, how do you let your soft animal
[0:42:19] SPEAKER_00: body love what it loves? And here's where people go immediately in their thinking mind is, well,
[0:42:24] Unknown: then I'll never get anything important done. I'll never. No, I think people do this constantly.
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_00: Raging gluttonous slut. Well, then I'll never wash the floor. I'll never do laundry. I'll never
[0:42:38] SPEAKER_00: raise my kid. But I don't. That's not true. I don't find that to be true. I've really deeply
[0:42:43] SPEAKER_00: enjoyed washing dishes and cleaning the floor. And I certainly enjoy raising my child even when
[0:42:48] SPEAKER_00: stuff arises. So it's like these things co mingle enjoyment and acceptance, co mingle. But it also,
[0:42:55] SPEAKER_00: sometimes it really arises that like doing the dishes, warm water, soapy suds, moment of quiet,
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_00: going something is dirty is now clean, and it's stacked on the dish thing. Like it's just simple.
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't have to be, I want to go to carnival and like have an amazing experience. It's the
[0:43:14] SPEAKER_00: little things that are happening in your environment right now. Yeah, Thich Nhat Hanh is like the master
[0:43:21] SPEAKER_01: of like exemplifying enjoyment in the moment to moment things. And if you all haven't listened
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_01: to Thich Nhat Hanh or read him, it's like an act of moment to moment joy just to kind of behold that.
[0:43:37] Unknown: Yeah, he transmits that I think really quite spectacularly. Yeah, it's really beautiful.
[0:43:42] Unknown: Great. So enthusiasm, it's enthusiasm. Now, when you described what he was saying, and in a way,
[0:43:52] SPEAKER_01: it's like the most I think, undefined, right? Like it's like an arrow singing through the air. Like
[0:43:58] SPEAKER_01: we can all relate to what it's like when you're trying to fix a tire and like, okay, let me just
[0:44:03] SPEAKER_01: accept this is what arises. There's no sense in being like, stupid so and so didn't, you know,
[0:44:08] SPEAKER_01: whatever. We can relate to that pretty easily. We all can relate to joy and not joy, whether we're
[0:44:15] Unknown: good at it or struggling with it. But this sense of like the arrow singing through the air.
[0:44:22] SPEAKER_01: Do you want to share what you think like enthusiasm looks like in your moment to moment?
[0:44:27] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Well, I think that he's what he's pointing at is the flow state, which I haven't read it in
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_00: a long time, but Mikhail, she send me hi. What? What up? Someone can pronounce that name.
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_00: Wow. I used to work for a learning nonprofit that promoted his book quite a lot. So I had to say
[0:44:49] SPEAKER_00: that name to a lot of people. It's the only reason why I can pronounce it. He wrote a book called
[0:44:54] SPEAKER_00: Flow. And there are lots of other people who talk about flow states. It gets a certain amount of
[0:45:01] SPEAKER_00: attention these days, which is great. Although of course, we corrupted towards achieving superhuman
[0:45:05] Unknown: goals. He go mine gets involved. And I mean, the word that I was thinking of when I was reading
[0:45:13] SPEAKER_00: him that comes from Taoism, I think is Wu Wei, which I'm probably mispronouncing. But it's this
[0:45:20] SPEAKER_00: way of Thank you. It's this way that things come through you. Like if you're spacious enough,
[0:45:30] SPEAKER_00: it's just unfolding. So it's enjoyable. Yes. But it has this extra effortless wind at your back
[0:45:40] SPEAKER_00: momentum. And it also feels to me like when I feel into it, like it has a a target, not in terms of
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_00: a goal future tense that I've picked out in advance, like I'm gonna have this much percentage
[0:45:53] SPEAKER_00: of body fat or even like I'm going to be really successful at this particular kind of career.
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: It's not that it's more like you don't know where it's going. Actually, you're the one that's on the
[0:46:04] SPEAKER_00: rocket going for the ride. But it just feels extremely pleasurable to be on the rocket going
[0:46:10] SPEAKER_00: for the ride. And what that looks like in an actual practical life is that you're just doing
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_00: whatever the things are that naturally arise that keep letting this singing arrow through the air
[0:46:20] SPEAKER_00: unfold. And it just keeps happening and the resources and the support you need come up
[0:46:24] SPEAKER_00: under your feet and the energy you need for it and the people you need to talk to. And it I think
[0:46:30] SPEAKER_00: that this is probably the least common strangely in our culture. I mean, I hope I think everyone
[0:46:36] SPEAKER_00: can come up with a time in their life when they feel like they were led towards something that
[0:46:42] Unknown: was unfolding through them. And I think if we all kind of take a moment to think about it,
[0:46:48] Unknown: well, we would find those little things. But it's, yeah, it's interesting, right? Because
[0:46:55] SPEAKER_00: we're such a goal oriented culture. And I don't think we have that experience that much. It's
[0:46:59] SPEAKER_00: because we're so busy contorting our goals and like forcing ourselves puppeteering ourselves to
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_00: do the thing we've picked out in advance that we're going to do. But if it's something that
[0:47:10] Unknown: is mission led or part work, it has a totally different quality. It's like it does itself.
[0:47:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Does Eckhart actually talk about like the synchronicities that could arise when you're in
[0:47:22] SPEAKER_01: that state? Or is that you just adding that? Because I'm imagining-
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_00: I don't remember. That's me adding it, but I can't remember. I'd have to revisit.
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_01: Because I'm imagining, you know, that's kind of how purpose led work feels and like, you know,
[0:47:34] SPEAKER_01: heart centered places. Like the road keeps rising up to meet you. But I was thinking of it just in
[0:47:39] SPEAKER_01: this moment to moment way. If you make it really simple, it's like there's certain moments that
[0:47:45] SPEAKER_01: just have this kind of energy of alignment, like where things are just kind of moving through you.
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_01: I experience it most readily with public speaking or my work. In fact, it's why I do my work. And
[0:48:00] Unknown: it's funny because I wouldn't call it enjoyable. I wouldn't not call it enjoyable either. I wouldn't
[0:48:06] SPEAKER_01: say like, oh, what I do is no fun and I don't like it. I would never put any negatives to it,
[0:48:10] Unknown: but I wouldn't be like, oh, it's so enjoyable to do what I do. But what I do, like it's more
[0:48:17] SPEAKER_01: enjoyable to talk to you on Bliss and Grit. But what does happen when I work is it feels like
[0:48:25] Unknown: singing. It feels like channeling. It feels like this incredible movement through me that has such a
[0:48:32] Unknown: rightness to it. It feels so right not to be caught in my own thought stream, but just to be
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_01: open and receiving the moment and moving with the moment as the moment arises.
[0:48:49] Unknown: I was thinking just on a very moment to moment level, if you think about flow state, it's just
[0:48:56] Unknown: where are those places where you feel led and moved? And I don't know what other words he
[0:49:04] SPEAKER_01: would use. It always feels to me like channeling just because I don't know how else to describe
[0:49:08] SPEAKER_01: that something is arising through you without any contrivance.
[0:49:12] Unknown: Yeah. And since I've totally, and since I've totally Debbie Downard on athletic pursuits,
[0:49:20] Unknown: I would like to say what you're describing, when you see athletes who have accomplished amazing
[0:49:28] SPEAKER_00: feats, the ultra marathoners or the, the ones that are really successful, they're coming from
[0:49:37] SPEAKER_00: enthusiasm. It's because it is for them what is genuinely true for their life. And it's this
[0:49:45] SPEAKER_00: beautiful thing for whatever reason, which I think will always be a mystery about why any one of us
[0:49:51] SPEAKER_00: has our different assignments or things that hit just the right chord and have just the right
[0:49:56] SPEAKER_00: resonance. But for whatever reason, that person, that exceptional ultra marathoner, that's what's
[0:50:06] SPEAKER_00: right for them. That's what's true for them.
[0:50:07] SPEAKER_00: That's where they're finding enthusiasm. It's that alignment piece. I would say
[0:50:12] Unknown: doing bliss and grit hits all three for me from the sense of like accepting whatever's arising in
[0:50:20] SPEAKER_01: us, you know, which is not sometimes so easy. It's like, of course,
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_01: like our last episode when I was just a big lump and I was a big lump.
[0:50:28] SPEAKER_01: And then I hated myself for overcompensating and it's like, and then, okay, well that arises. And
[0:50:34] SPEAKER_01: then we just accept that maybe there's something to offer. It's not, everyone doesn't even have
[0:50:38] SPEAKER_01: to like it. It's like, maybe they'll learn what not to do. Maybe you'll learn what to do. Maybe
[0:50:41] SPEAKER_01: it'll invite some revelation. Or that it's okay to be a lump and it's okay to overcompensate.
[0:50:44] SPEAKER_01: And yeah, it all happens. Yeah.
[0:50:48] SPEAKER_01: We have to keep meeting it like always because it's so vulnerable to just talk about yourself a lot.
[0:50:54] Unknown: And so to me, there's a lot of acceptance and then there's enjoyment because it is fun to me
[0:51:00] SPEAKER_01: to talk to you. That's a little different than just when I work because I'm a little bit more
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_01: involved in the conversation. We talk about very deep stuff when I work, so I wouldn't label it as
[0:51:12] SPEAKER_01: fun times. And we're friends, so it's a different kind of back and forth. Yeah.
[0:51:17] SPEAKER_01: I'm much more involved as Vanessa, the personality when I'm talking to you. And then there's
[0:51:23] Unknown: enthusiasm because well, we literally don't do anything we don't feel like doing. That doesn't
[0:51:30] Unknown: feel like a line. Right. It doesn't feel like zing. So that's the trifecta for me of getting
[0:51:40] SPEAKER_01: to work with these things with that cartole. And of course, in other areas of your life,
[0:51:44] SPEAKER_01: it may not be so simple. In relationships, accepting that my parents are a certain way
[0:51:50] SPEAKER_01: and they feel a certain way and they're saying a certain thing. And then accepting what I feel
[0:51:54] SPEAKER_01: in response. All of a sudden, I may get into trickier terrain and y'all may notice a similar
[0:52:00] SPEAKER_01: thing, like certain aspects of life. You might find this really workable and really a great
[0:52:07] SPEAKER_01: practice. And then you might find these little pie pieces that are trickier and that's cool.
[0:52:14] Unknown: Accept that and then just stay with the awareness of it. And play. Try it out. I have found it to be
[0:52:23] SPEAKER_00: a very curious unfolding in my life when I remind myself of those three things and I'm noticing a
[0:52:29] Unknown: moment and I'm like, well, which is pretty fascinating. It's good times. Okay. Let us know
