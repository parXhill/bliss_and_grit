[0:00:24] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls.
[0:00:31] SPEAKER_00: You are listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:32] SPEAKER_00: I'm Brooke Thomas, and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we are talking about being on the embodied spiritual path.
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_00: And what does that actually mean?
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_00: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_00: All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that there's
[0:00:52] Unknown: a human life.
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_00: And today we're talking about the power of words, so how we are shaped by the words that
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_00: we hear and how we shape our worlds with the words that we use.
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: But in particular, we're really dialing into how we shape people's view of who we are
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_00: with the words that we can usually, typically, unconsciously use about ourselves.
[0:01:17] Unknown: Now, commonly, when people head into this kind of conversation, this kind of territory,
[0:01:23] SPEAKER_00: there are teachings that crop up, particularly in popular culture, about how we need to edit
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_00: and suppress ourselves or pretend to be something other than what we feel.
[0:01:33] SPEAKER_00: So a lot of what we're doing here is exploring shame, blame, and superstition-free inquiries
[0:01:39] SPEAKER_00: around how we can shift the words that we use to describe ourselves and the world we
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_00: live in and therefore create different kinds of relationships and experiences and just
[0:01:50] SPEAKER_00: views of what's going on here.
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, we would of course be thrilled if you left a review on iTunes

[0:02:26] Unknown: So it's exciting.
[0:02:28] SPEAKER_00: One last thing before we head into the conversation.
[0:02:31] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes we swear.
[0:02:32] SPEAKER_00: So if you're in company where you don't want swears to be a fly in, you can wear headphones.
[0:02:37] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:39] Unknown: Hello Brooke.
[0:02:40] Unknown: Hey Vanessa.
[0:02:42] SPEAKER_00: So one topic that's been on my mind a lot lately, besides the nervous system, I was
[0:02:51] Unknown: obsessed.
[0:02:52] SPEAKER_00: Yes, we're both obsessed.
[0:02:55] Unknown: The other thing obsessed with is the power of words.
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_00: And I'll say what I mean because I think a lot of people talk about the power of words
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_00: And I'm not actually always in agreement with what some of the teachings are on it.
[0:03:12] SPEAKER_00: So we have a whole 45 to 50 minutes to be very clear about what we do mean.
[0:03:20] SPEAKER_00: So let me just dive in.
[0:03:23] Unknown: Okay, so if you all heard the Matt Conner interview, and Brooke, you did, you were there, we were
[0:03:30] SPEAKER_00: talking about words, right?
[0:03:32] SPEAKER_00: Because when I had gone on retreat with Matt in April in Portland, he was teaching about
[0:03:41] SPEAKER_00: words.
[0:03:42] SPEAKER_00: He was really doing a beautiful deconstruction meditation to help you start to release your
[0:03:47] SPEAKER_00: grip onto concepts and beliefs.
[0:03:49] Unknown: And so the way that he started it was by pointing to how people's words essentially shaped your
[0:03:57] SPEAKER_00: entire experience of reality.
[0:04:00] SPEAKER_00: In the example he gave at that moment, even the word enlightenment, he was saying, like,
[0:04:05] SPEAKER_00: you think it's supposed to look a certain way or be a certain way, like someone taught
[0:04:09] Unknown: you what that word is.
[0:04:12] SPEAKER_00: And he was talking about, of course, like, people teach you through their actions, through
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_00: the words they use, through the words they don't use, how to see yourself, what to value,
[0:04:23] Unknown: what to prioritize, what to put your attention on, how to imagine love, what to expect, what
[0:04:30] SPEAKER_00: a good life looks like, what a safe life looks like, and so forth.
[0:04:34] SPEAKER_00: And I thought that was really powerful.
[0:04:37] SPEAKER_00: I don't know why.
[0:04:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's not that this isn't something we all could have understood at some point.
[0:04:43] SPEAKER_00: They understand what conditioning is.
[0:04:44] SPEAKER_00: But you know, like, right moment, right time, right medicine, and something just explodes
[0:04:50] SPEAKER_00: in you.
[0:04:51] Unknown: And I got really clear, like, wow, okay.
[0:04:56] Unknown: So all it would have taken, for example, for me to get a complex where I thought I
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_00: was a weirdo, that's one of my complexes, y'all, if you've been listening, you know
[0:05:08] SPEAKER_00: it, right?
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_00: It's not really there anymore.
[0:05:10] SPEAKER_00: Just an update.
[0:05:11] SPEAKER_00: It hangs around the fringes.
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: So that was like a lifelong one, right?
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm a weirdo, I'm a misfit.
[0:05:18] SPEAKER_00: So all it would have taken was me to come home one day from school, tell my mom that
[0:05:24] SPEAKER_00: was picking on me.
[0:05:26] SPEAKER_00: And for her to have in innocence chosen the words, wow, it must feel so hard not to fit
[0:05:32] Unknown: in.
[0:05:33] SPEAKER_00: And your innocent mind's like, wait, what?
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_00: I don't fit in.
[0:05:36] Unknown: Oh, God, newsflash.
[0:05:37] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's how I'm supposed to interpret this thing.
[0:05:42] Unknown: Where this little girl picked on me.
[0:05:45] Unknown: What?
[0:05:46] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:05:47] SPEAKER_00: And it's so innocent.
[0:05:48] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, no one is to blame.
[0:05:51] SPEAKER_00: But that's a trip, isn't it?
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_00: If you slow that down and you realize that your parents conditioning, your siblings conditioning,
[0:06:00] Unknown: their parents conditioning, that all of these things are influencing how they'll choose
[0:06:06] SPEAKER_00: their words in any given moment to speak to you about a circumstance that is arising.
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_00: And thereby, they'll give you meaning.
[0:06:15] Unknown: They'll shape the meaning you take out of any given circumstance.
[0:06:20] SPEAKER_00: It kind of blows the mind, right?
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_00: Especially since most of us don't have to go back very far in our lineage to experience
[0:06:30] Unknown: real trauma, right?
[0:06:32] SPEAKER_00: Either you yourself experienced it in real time, or I mean, you don't have to go very,
[0:06:37] SPEAKER_00: very far back one or two generations and you'll see, you know, people coming over on boats
[0:06:43] Unknown: and the whole of abode and slavery and all sorts of traumas.
[0:06:48] Unknown: So that got me thinking about the power of the word, which moved into me reflecting on
[0:06:55] Unknown: the power of the words we use in terms of shaping other people's realities, but specifically
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_00: in terms of shaping people's experience of us.
[0:07:11] SPEAKER_00: Want to take it from there?
[0:07:12] Unknown: Sure.
[0:07:13] Unknown: I don't know what I'm going to say, but I'm going to take it from there.
[0:07:22] SPEAKER_00: So there are a couple of ways that my mind goes with that.
[0:07:25] Unknown: One is something that I'm noticing in myself lately.
[0:07:32] SPEAKER_00: And the other is just knowing the tendency.
[0:07:34] Unknown: So we can have all of these unconscious, this is the tendency, unconscious tendencies to
[0:07:41] Unknown: view ourselves a certain way.
[0:07:44] SPEAKER_00: And by unconscious, I mean, literally, we're not conscious of the ways that we view ourselves.
[0:07:49] Unknown: And so those can often be identities around, you gave the weird one example or the burdensome
[0:08:01] SPEAKER_00: one, the one who never gets a lucky break, you know, all these kinds of things are ways
[0:08:09] SPEAKER_00: I think Lock Kelly was calling them sub-personalities.
[0:08:13] SPEAKER_00: We've had teachers, you know, Kieran, Trace and Cartole who call them pain bodies.
[0:08:18] Unknown: So those things can run through our systems enough that we use words that keep demonstrating
[0:08:26] SPEAKER_00: them to other people.
[0:08:28] SPEAKER_00: So we can always, like something that's so simple, but I'm noticing when I write emails
[0:08:37] Unknown: or texts, which these days all of us do plenty, how it's so great because it's written down.
[0:08:44] SPEAKER_00: So it slows me down and I can have some witness on it.
[0:08:48] Unknown: I'm so fucking apologetic.
[0:08:51] Unknown: Always over nothing, over my existence, right?
[0:08:55] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry, but I meant to write you back yesterday, but or just that's the word too.
[0:09:03] SPEAKER_00: I'm just getting in touch to confirm that we have a meeting tomorrow.
[0:09:07] SPEAKER_00: Just that word, just.
[0:09:09] SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
[0:09:10] SPEAKER_00: Like everything has this kind of like this sort of curtsy and lowering head.
[0:09:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry that I'm taking up any space.
[0:09:20] SPEAKER_00: And it's really fascinating.
[0:09:21] SPEAKER_00: Like that's something I've been watching in myself, that tendency.
[0:09:24] Unknown: And that's just languaging that before I had any awareness of it, it was the polite thing
[0:09:31] SPEAKER_00: to do, it was the right thing to do, or it was just what I was doing without any awareness
[0:09:35] Unknown: at all.
[0:09:39] SPEAKER_00: And then I've also been noticing lately, because I'm at this stage right now where there's
[0:09:42] SPEAKER_00: certain patterns that I've had my entire life that are continuing.
[0:09:48] SPEAKER_00: But on it, they're continuing in a much, much lighter way.
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_00: And I have awareness.
[0:09:52] SPEAKER_00: So we talked about this, I think in the Locke and Matt similarities between teachings episode,
[0:09:59] SPEAKER_00: it's like there's this taking a tour.
[0:10:03] SPEAKER_00: Now instead of being in the thing, you're like driving a tour bus through the thing
[0:10:07] SPEAKER_00: and you're like, oh, I see out the window that and I see that.
[0:10:11] SPEAKER_00: I think of it like an it's a small world, right?
[0:10:15] SPEAKER_00: You used to be one of the animatronics.
[0:10:21] SPEAKER_00: And now you're in the little boat watching the animatronics.
[0:10:23] Unknown: Exactly what it feels like.
[0:10:27] Unknown: So it's fascinating because it's like the thing, the small world ride hasn't changed,
[0:10:34] SPEAKER_00: although I would say the patterns are much, much lighter.
[0:10:37] SPEAKER_00: But now I'm observing them.
[0:10:38] SPEAKER_00: And so one of the other ones besides the like, I am so apologetic for my existence all the
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_00: time, particularly when I write things down.
[0:10:45] Unknown: The other one is how frequently and quickly I go to despair stories.
[0:10:52] SPEAKER_00: And like, there is fucking plenty to despair about these days.
[0:10:56] SPEAKER_00: So it's not like I'm making shit up.
[0:10:58] SPEAKER_00: You know, like I'm usually talking about situations, political situations and human situations
[0:11:03] Unknown: out there in the world.
[0:11:05] SPEAKER_00: But it's like, wow, I really, and especially I notice I'll do it if it's somebody who
[0:11:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm actually not that close to, which is kind of interesting.
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_00: So a friend, but like three layers out.
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_00: So an acquaintance, which is fascinating because what are we doing with acquaintances?
[0:11:24] SPEAKER_00: We're trying to get to know one another.
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_00: And each of us is like demonstrating I'm this kind of person with these kinds of thoughts
[0:11:32] Unknown: and opinions.
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_00: And so with somebody like you or some of my other very close to your friends, it's just
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_00: much more intimate.
[0:11:42] SPEAKER_00: It's not that I'm not talking about being upset about things in the world, but it's
[0:11:44] Unknown: fascinating how quickly I go to demonstrating despair and using words.
[0:11:53] SPEAKER_00: You know, feeling rage or despair or upset is fine, but I go into this hopelessness
[0:11:58] SPEAKER_00: place. And so what I'm watching on the small world ride is like, oh, OK, not only am I
[0:12:04] SPEAKER_00: talking about the very real things that are happening in the world that very genuinely
[0:12:10] SPEAKER_00: break my heart, but I'm also offering the gift of hopelessness.
[0:12:17] Unknown: And the way that it's about me is like, I am the hopeless one, right?
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_00: Like I am the one who sees the injustice and feels hopeless about humanity.
[0:12:32] SPEAKER_00: So those are a couple that I'm watching in myself.
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_00: And I just think that when we can get to that level, a couple of interesting things come
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_00: up because, OK, I'm observing them.
[0:12:40] SPEAKER_00: So some of the teachings that we would hear very much, let's say, more in popular culture
[0:12:47] SPEAKER_00: about that are like, oh, OK, good.
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_00: Don't do that anymore.
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_00: And like I was joking with I was talking with one of my clients the other day.
[0:12:54] SPEAKER_00: Maybe I've said this on the show. I apologize for repeating myself, but there was a Saturday
[0:12:59] SPEAKER_00: night live skit a long time ago where Bob Newhart played a psychologist.
[0:13:04] SPEAKER_00: Did you ever see this one?
[0:13:05] SPEAKER_00: The therapist. And so the skit was him as the therapist, and he would have different
[0:13:10] SPEAKER_00: clients come through and they would say all the things you would say to a therapist.
[0:13:14] SPEAKER_00: You know, I can't recover from my broken heart or I don't know why I can't stop
[0:13:17] SPEAKER_00: cheating on my wife or I have a gambling addiction or all these things.
[0:13:21] SPEAKER_00: And the only thing he would say in response, just sitting back like glasses on his nose,
[0:13:26] SPEAKER_00: clipboard in his hand was, we'll just stop doing that.
[0:13:29] Unknown: Yeah, but I've really tried and oh, my God, I mean, I drink three bottles of wine a night
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_00: and and then I noticed the next day about all this money on horses.
[0:13:38] SPEAKER_00: Well, you should stop it.
[0:13:40] SPEAKER_00: I really want to stop it, but stop it.
[0:13:42] Unknown: Just stop it. Just stop doing that.
[0:13:44] SPEAKER_00: And so it would be awesome if it were that.
[0:13:48] SPEAKER_00: So great. It's like and so we treat like none of us would go to a therapist who sat
[0:13:54] SPEAKER_00: across from us and only said the phrase, we'll just stop doing that because it's
[0:13:59] SPEAKER_00: insane. It's like, obviously, we know we don't want to be doing the behavior.
[0:14:02] SPEAKER_00: It's why we're in the office.
[0:14:04] SPEAKER_00: But we treat ourselves that way.
[0:14:06] Unknown: Right. So, oh, Brooke, you're demonstrating that you're the hopeless one or that
[0:14:12] SPEAKER_00: you're the one who has to apologize for her existence.
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_00: Just stop it. Turn that front upside down or put on a new persona, right?
[0:14:20] SPEAKER_00: Like a more bold, more courageous, more optimistic one.
[0:14:26] SPEAKER_00: But it just doesn't quite work.
[0:14:27] Unknown: Right. And so then we just wind up creating like a harder
[0:14:32] SPEAKER_00: shell around the pattern because we're just shellacking it and we're layering it
[0:14:37] SPEAKER_00: with some new thing.
[0:14:40] SPEAKER_00: So I feel like it would be interesting to explore like what do in something I've
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_00: been exploring internally in myself, because it can be quite uncomfortable to see
[0:14:50] SPEAKER_00: with a lot of clarity.
[0:14:51] Unknown: Oh, my gosh, I do that all the time.
[0:14:54] Unknown: I'm really teaching people who I am with my words.
[0:14:58] Unknown: And I'm really teaching them how to treat me.
[0:15:02] Unknown: And I don't like what I'm teaching.
[0:15:05] Unknown: Ooh, like if I got to pick from a menu, I wouldn't pick those ones, but I seem to keep
[0:15:11] SPEAKER_00: doing it. I can watch myself like I'm watching a movie act this out over and over
[0:15:16] SPEAKER_00: and over again.
[0:15:18] Unknown: But shame is not the answer.
[0:15:20] Unknown: Like, why did you do that again, Brooke?
[0:15:22] SPEAKER_00: What's wrong with that?
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_00: Well, that's definitely we know.
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_00: Never our answer.
[0:15:27] SPEAKER_00: Never the one we resort to.
[0:15:29] Unknown: But it is interesting to consider.
[0:15:32] Unknown: I mean, some of what I heard and what you said or what I took from it was, OK, so
[0:15:39] SPEAKER_00: let's say when you meet these third layer out people and you're sharing the stories
[0:15:45] Unknown: of hopelessness and despair, one might imagine that somewhere along the line you
[0:15:50] SPEAKER_00: got that that's the way that people bond.
[0:15:53] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:15:53] Unknown: That's some way that people get to know each other and they bond, right?
[0:15:59] Unknown: Wherever you got that picture in your life.
[0:16:02] Unknown: So it is interesting to imagine because what happens then, it's so sad that our
[0:16:08] SPEAKER_00: brains do this, but our brains put people into buckets and categories.
[0:16:12] SPEAKER_00: So then the person goes, oh, great.
[0:16:14] SPEAKER_00: So whenever I want to talk about this sad, despairing thing, I know who to go to.
[0:16:19] Unknown: Brooke is really going to hear me.
[0:16:20] SPEAKER_00: She's really going to be there.
[0:16:21] SPEAKER_00: And you're like, oh God, I also want the really good news conversations and the
[0:16:26] SPEAKER_00: really light conversations, right?
[0:16:30] Unknown: But I'm trying to think, OK, so I'm trying to think through really the
[0:16:35] Unknown: question you pose, like what do you do about it?
[0:16:37] SPEAKER_00: Because I feel like I have used behavioral intervention with myself.
[0:16:43] SPEAKER_00: And I'm wondering what I did.
[0:16:46] Unknown: For example, I was always the person who apologized for myself too.
[0:16:49] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if this is a common female issue.
[0:16:54] SPEAKER_00: I think it is really common female issue.
[0:16:56] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know if it's also generational.
[0:16:58] SPEAKER_00: Like, I'm not sure if, if all of you listeners in your early twenties go
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_00: through this the way that we may go through this, because our parents were
[0:17:07] SPEAKER_00: raised in a different generation, but I don't know if it's a really common
[0:17:11] SPEAKER_00: thing, but we're raised in a different generation entirely with how they
[0:17:14] Unknown: treated women, but I know that I have a lot of clients who do it, right?
[0:17:19] SPEAKER_00: You apologize when you're crying.
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_00: Like, oh, heaven forbid, I burdened you with my heartfelt emotions, right?
[0:17:26] SPEAKER_00: And I used to do that all the time.
[0:17:28] SPEAKER_00: You're in therapy asking for a tissue and going, I'm so sorry,
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_00: you know, that you're crying, right?
[0:17:37] SPEAKER_00: Or when you're in a plane and you're sitting in the middle seat and you have
[0:17:41] SPEAKER_00: to get out to go to the bathroom and you have to ask that person to get up.
[0:17:45] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[0:17:47] SPEAKER_00: Would you move?
[0:17:49] Unknown: And I remember also seeing what I spoke about and how it felt in my body.
[0:17:57] SPEAKER_00: Like, did that feel true to me when I was saying it?
[0:17:59] Unknown: Did it feel like resonant?
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_00: Was I speaking from a place of depth, like connection, I should say, probably
[0:18:06] SPEAKER_00: connection to myself, or was I speaking from habit?
[0:18:12] SPEAKER_00: And as I observed all of that, gosh, I feel like what I did do was experiment
[0:18:17] SPEAKER_00: with doing it differently, like experiment with it, like what would happen?
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_00: I mean, obviously most of it is unconscious, right?
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_00: Then it can start to come to our consciousness.
[0:18:30] SPEAKER_00: Like, oh my God, I'm teaching people to see me as the insecure one.
[0:18:36] SPEAKER_00: For example, that's another one we do all the time.
[0:18:38] SPEAKER_00: Oh, what?
[0:18:39] SPEAKER_00: No, I don't feel pretty like you fit right.
[0:18:42] SPEAKER_00: All of that.
[0:18:43] SPEAKER_00: And then I'm teaching people to see me that way.
[0:18:47] SPEAKER_00: But I have a million things I could say to someone, right?
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_00: A million things that are genuine to me.
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_00: So I think what I did was I started to experiment with it, like experiment with
[0:18:58] Unknown: getting up on a plane and not saying I'm so sorry and experiment with sharing a
[0:19:05] Unknown: different story, like rather than the insecure one, which was the one I was
[0:19:11] SPEAKER_00: using to bond with people.
[0:19:13] Unknown: And then I would watch and see, because the whole movement of that, the whole
[0:19:20] SPEAKER_00: movement of the words and how we're choosing our words unconsciously reflects
[0:19:26] SPEAKER_00: the belief system, right?
[0:19:27] SPEAKER_00: So let's just imagine, I don't know, you might know what your belief systems are.
[0:19:32] SPEAKER_00: But let's say, for example, when I get up and I apologize for making someone move,
[0:19:38] SPEAKER_00: it really is because I felt like I had to apologize for my existence.
[0:19:42] SPEAKER_00: That's really root, root, root, root.
[0:19:45] SPEAKER_00: What was that?
[0:19:47] SPEAKER_00: So then of course it might be scary not to use those words.
[0:19:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry.
[0:19:51] Unknown: Like it may be all sorts of uncomfortable, but if you do that without using those
[0:19:56] SPEAKER_00: words and no one's upset and nothing happens, that's bad.
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_00: It starts to open up new possibilities in your being.
[0:20:05] SPEAKER_00: Same thing.
[0:20:06] Unknown: Like what if you thought, I want to bond with someone, but I'm not going to use
[0:20:12] SPEAKER_00: the stories of despair, or in my case, the way I was bonding with people is like,
[0:20:17] SPEAKER_00: let me show you my belly.
[0:20:19] SPEAKER_00: Let me show you how vulnerable I am.
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_00: So let me tell you, I have problems too.
[0:20:24] SPEAKER_00: So then you'll feel safe with me.
[0:20:26] SPEAKER_00: Which isn't wrong.
[0:20:28] SPEAKER_00: It's just creating a certain perception and it may or may not be genuine in that
[0:20:32] SPEAKER_00: moment for me to create that perception.
[0:20:34] Unknown: So, but if I don't do it, then what happens?
[0:20:38] SPEAKER_00: Like, do people bond with me?
[0:20:40] SPEAKER_00: Don't they?
[0:20:40] SPEAKER_00: Does my worst fear come to pass?
[0:20:42] SPEAKER_00: Do you know what I mean about that?
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_00: Like experimentation, but not.
[0:20:48] SPEAKER_00: I know that I always get hung up around behavior change because I often don't
[0:20:52] SPEAKER_00: offer behavior changes because usually enough awareness, something shifts.
[0:20:57] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:20:58] SPEAKER_00: But every once in a while, I do think it's useful when we play an experiment with
[0:21:03] SPEAKER_00: like, well, what would happen if I did this differently?
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_00: No, I think super useful.
[0:21:07] Unknown: And what you're describing is taking those behavior experiments without shame.
[0:21:17] SPEAKER_00: Also without pretending.
[0:21:20] SPEAKER_00: Like I've heard some people do this.
[0:21:21] Unknown: I remember a bajillion years ago, there was somebody who I knew in a classroom
[0:21:26] Unknown: setting, so not somebody who was a close friend, but whenever something upsetting
[0:21:30] SPEAKER_00: would come up or emotions, and this was when I was training at the Rolfe Institute.
[0:21:33] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, we're training as body workers, shit comes up all the time.
[0:21:37] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't like a history class or something where things aren't going to get intense.
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_00: We're not going to talk about things.
[0:21:43] SPEAKER_00: You go cancel clear and then smile and walk away and then like stiffen his spine
[0:21:51] SPEAKER_00: and get this kind of up above orientation with people, like bigger spine, kind of
[0:21:56] SPEAKER_00: almost like a actual physical looking down on the people, cancel clear.
[0:22:00] Unknown: And sometimes you would actually like tidy, you know, wipe his hands and walk away.
[0:22:06] SPEAKER_00: So that's avoiding.
[0:22:08] SPEAKER_00: Shame is like, why can't I stop?
[0:22:11] SPEAKER_00: Or I'm the word.
[0:22:11] SPEAKER_00: What's wrong with me?
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_00: I should be farther along in my healing journey.
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_00: You know, so those things are not, not useful.
[0:22:18] SPEAKER_00: And you're describing like experimenting with behavior without any of that.
[0:22:23] Unknown: So like, for example, in my texts and emails, and it's fascinating too, to take
[0:22:28] SPEAKER_00: these tiny little tweaks, like you're describing on the plane, just not saying
[0:22:32] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry, you can say, excuse me.
[0:22:34] SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
[0:22:34] SPEAKER_00: Both of which are polite, neither of which apologize for your existence.
[0:22:39] SPEAKER_00: And if I text people or, or email people and I won't let myself use the word
[0:22:44] Unknown: just or sorry, it feels uncomfortable.
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:22:50] SPEAKER_00: But it's so great.
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_00: You know, so it's, it's like written so I can slow down and be very conscious.
[0:22:56] SPEAKER_00: See the word I removed the amount of just and sorry that I'm deleting.
[0:23:02] SPEAKER_00: It's really entertaining or extra exclamation points.
[0:23:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm threatening.
[0:23:08] Unknown: So just changing that is such a great little modification because it's tiny.
[0:23:14] SPEAKER_00: It's visible.
[0:23:15] Unknown: It's obvious.
[0:23:16] SPEAKER_00: And the fact that it's uncomfortable means that something is shifting in me
[0:23:23] SPEAKER_00: because I'm pushing against patterns, not in an aggressive self-loathing way, but
[0:23:28] Unknown: just literally what would happen if I just communicated with people and they
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_00: would just get the information I'm trying to convey without the additional
[0:23:36] SPEAKER_00: information, oh PS, I'm sorry that I exist.
[0:23:40] SPEAKER_00: And then maybe you'll interrupt the feedback loop where your own words make
[0:23:46] Unknown: you think you need to be sorry for your own existence, right?
[0:23:50] SPEAKER_00: It's like almost like the more that is our need to be sorry, the more we
[0:23:56] SPEAKER_00: can be more comfortable with it.
[0:23:59] Unknown: Almost like the more that is our natural flow and we're using words and behaviors
[0:24:07] Unknown: and actions to reflect this, you know, mythological belief system we have.
[0:24:15] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm weird or we have to apologize for our existence.
[0:24:19] SPEAKER_00: The more we keep using words that set that into place, it's almost like we
[0:24:24] SPEAKER_00: believe it in part because then, you know, some people can treat us such a way.
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_00: Now saying I'm so sorry is not usually the biggest deal.
[0:24:33] SPEAKER_00: Any nice person won't think much of it, but it does kind of signal people I've
[0:24:40] Unknown: done something wrong and it can get them to think it like maybe you did do
[0:24:45] SPEAKER_00: something wrong, you know, you're always doing this and this and that can start
[0:24:50] SPEAKER_00: like a whole cycle in effect.
[0:24:51] Unknown: You know, even bigger if we're always, let's say only sharing the part of us
[0:24:58] SPEAKER_00: that's in despair and not sharing the part of us that's like overflowing with
[0:25:02] SPEAKER_00: gratitude and joy, then people could come to see us as the despairing one.
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: And then maybe they don't want to share with us when they're elated because
[0:25:11] SPEAKER_00: they're thinking, oh, I don't want to upset her.
[0:25:14] SPEAKER_00: You know, she's not going to ruin her despair party.
[0:25:17] Unknown: Yes.
[0:25:18] Unknown: So in the, and then we're like, more and more swimming in aloneness with the
[0:25:24] SPEAKER_00: experience, right?
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_00: So that's one thing that's obvious.
[0:25:28] SPEAKER_00: We did a whole episode on like self-fulfilling prophecies at one point
[0:25:31] SPEAKER_00: and how like, you know, crossing your arms makes someone maybe not want to talk to
[0:25:35] SPEAKER_00: you.
[0:25:36] Unknown: And then you're like, I knew I was a loser and no one liked me.
[0:25:39] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:25:41] SPEAKER_00: But there's this other piece.
[0:25:42] SPEAKER_00: It's like a feedback loop with ourselves.
[0:25:44] SPEAKER_00: One, because then maybe no one talks to you about their elation just in this
[0:25:50] Unknown: made up part of this example, but two, because every time we say it, it's like,
[0:25:57] SPEAKER_00: you know how they say the brain is kind of like a computer, like the subconscious
[0:26:01] SPEAKER_00: mind is just being programmed.
[0:26:04] SPEAKER_00: The more I apologize for my existence, the more I'm in a feedback loop, almost
[0:26:08] SPEAKER_00: like planting seeds that I need to apologize for my existence.
[0:26:12] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:26:13] Unknown: And since the brain can't differentiate so well, like past, present, future, it's
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_00: just like, okay, still here, still need to apologize for my existence.
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_00: And I have to imagine that if other people's words shaped and conditioned us,
[0:26:30] SPEAKER_00: then to a certain extent, how we're using our words and what stories we're focusing
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_00: on are shaping and conditioning us.
[0:26:38] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:26:39] SPEAKER_00: It has to be some kind of feedback loop.
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_00: The giant caveat, I want to reflect what you were saying before, that cancel
[0:26:45] SPEAKER_00: clear thing, right?
[0:26:48] SPEAKER_00: This is where it gets sticky and we're all teaching kind of gets sticky because
[0:26:52] SPEAKER_00: it takes some subtlety to have an alive relationship with it.
[0:26:59] SPEAKER_00: It's certainly not about faking it and it's certainly not about editing and
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_00: deleting yourself as that is harmful in and of itself.
[0:27:07] Unknown: So I'm not a believer, like I've had friends who were like, don't say a
[0:27:11] SPEAKER_00: negative thing.
[0:27:12] SPEAKER_00: Like if you say, God, I'm afraid that my parents are going to be upset with me.
[0:27:17] SPEAKER_00: And they're like, don't say fear.
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_00: It's your superstitious option.
[0:27:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:27:21] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[0:27:22] SPEAKER_00: You felt a bad feeling.
[0:27:23] SPEAKER_00: You're doomed.
[0:27:25] SPEAKER_00: I mean, people have very elegant teachings around this.
[0:27:28] Unknown: MatCon actually has very elegant teachings around this for people who want to
[0:27:31] SPEAKER_00: be a part of the conversation.
[0:27:32] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's a great way to do it.
[0:27:35] SPEAKER_00: But from like the way my simple mind perceives of it, as I'm like, if there is
[0:27:39] Unknown: such a thing as a universe that has a rhyme or reason, it certainly doesn't
[0:27:46] SPEAKER_00: give a shit about the words I use every once in a while it's tuning into
[0:27:50] SPEAKER_00: something much deeper, much more alive.
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_00: And the rhyme or reason goes way beyond my passing moods, my passing thoughts.
[0:27:59] SPEAKER_00: It's like a very simple thing.
[0:28:01] Unknown: And the rhyme or reason goes way beyond my passing moods, my passing thoughts
[0:28:06] SPEAKER_00: and the words I use.
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_00: That's how I feel about it.
[0:28:09] SPEAKER_00: So I never felt like that made any sense to me.
[0:28:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, sure.
[0:28:14] SPEAKER_00: What makes sense to me is to be alive and alive.
[0:28:18] SPEAKER_00: People have all sorts of feelings and I get to acknowledge the aliveness within me.
[0:28:24] SPEAKER_00: But what I can understand on the other perspective is that it can become like a
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_00: we did an episode on it can become kind of a self fulfilling prophecy because.
[0:28:36] Unknown: It's like, if I believe as my persona, let's say that I'm someone who needs help.
[0:28:45] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:28:45] SPEAKER_00: When I was married to my ex husband, I kind of occupied that space with him more
[0:28:49] SPEAKER_00: because he was really good at occupying the space of helper.
[0:28:53] SPEAKER_00: So I sort of joined him by occupying the space of healthy.
[0:28:59] SPEAKER_00: And then you start to like speak about the help you need and you start to speak
[0:29:03] SPEAKER_00: about your problems and you start to share from that level.
[0:29:07] SPEAKER_00: And then people start to look at you as someone who needs help.
[0:29:09] Unknown: So they start to give you all sorts of handy advice and they start to do things for
[0:29:16] SPEAKER_00: you like the way, let's say if you were a little kid and you go home and you're
[0:29:19] SPEAKER_00: like, mom, I have to do this school project.
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_00: And she's like, I'll do it.
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_00: It's like that.
[0:29:24] SPEAKER_00: Like they start to do it for you.
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_00: And, and all of that starts feeding a loop back to you going, Oh my God, I'm
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_00: helpless, I couldn't do this without other people.
[0:29:34] SPEAKER_00: Or you're angry.
[0:29:35] SPEAKER_00: Like, why are other people treating me like I'm helpless?
[0:29:38] Unknown: Well, cause you know, you told them to, right?
[0:29:43] SPEAKER_00: You told them to, I mean, you're innocent and they're innocent.
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_00: And like everyone's innocent.
[0:29:48] SPEAKER_00: You may have done it because with that person, you really got the signal that
[0:29:52] SPEAKER_00: that's what they need to feel good.
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, the empath just steps right in without overthinking it.
[0:29:59] SPEAKER_00: But this is what these conversations are for.
[0:30:01] Unknown: So we can start to have a different vantage point and a different
[0:30:05] SPEAKER_00: consciousness and say, that's so interesting.
[0:30:08] SPEAKER_00: You know, what stories am I sharing about me when I can share 150 stories about me?
[0:30:16] Unknown: You know what, like if you're, when I sit with people and do counseling work, you
[0:30:21] SPEAKER_00: know, you get them for one hour a week, right?
[0:30:24] SPEAKER_00: And in that hour, they're going to tell you some of their really deep core things.
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_00: Oftentimes the things they're stuck with or struggling with or in pain, right?
[0:30:34] Unknown: But that doesn't mean in that week, they didn't have five days where there were
[0:30:38] SPEAKER_00: gloriously like in gratitude and feeling blessed and contributing to the world
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_00: at the highest level possible rate.
[0:30:47] SPEAKER_00: It's like, this is just one experience.
[0:30:50] SPEAKER_00: And so in that container, it's meant to be like that.
[0:30:54] SPEAKER_00: But if it was my friends and the only way I felt like I could bond with them or get
[0:30:59] Unknown: close was to share just the pain I'm having, then a different thing arises.
[0:31:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:31:08] SPEAKER_00: The, just want to kind of trace a little bit more what you, two of the patterns you
[0:31:12] SPEAKER_00: brought up, so there's the self-fulfilling prophecy one that you were just talking
[0:31:16] SPEAKER_00: about, which I think when we can see those with clarity and in a loving way
[0:31:20] SPEAKER_00: in ourselves, like how great, because then we don't have to keep fulfilling the
[0:31:25] Unknown: same prophecy we have about ourselves.
[0:31:28] SPEAKER_00: Unconsciously, we don't have to keep getting the same feedback loop.
[0:31:32] Unknown: Like, oh my gosh, I could disrupt that and have different kinds of interactions
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_00: and relationships and beliefs and feelings.
[0:31:38] Unknown: So that is like a huge liberator to be able to see that.
[0:31:43] Unknown: Um, and we already talked about experimenting without shame and blame.
[0:31:51] Unknown: And then the superstitious one, I just wanted to circle back to a little bit
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_00: more because it's really prevalent.
[0:31:59] SPEAKER_00: So interesting.
[0:32:00] Unknown: I mean, superstition has always ruled over these domains and organized religion has
[0:32:06] SPEAKER_00: its fair share.
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we could say a lot of it is superstition.
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_00: A lot of spirituality, superstitious, you know, and then we have these kind of pop
[0:32:14] SPEAKER_00: culture things like law of attraction and stuff.
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_00: And again, it becomes superstitious.
[0:32:18] Unknown: Like you will be, again, it's God as other, judging other, who's there to dole out
[0:32:25] SPEAKER_00: treats or punishments, right?
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_00: Which all of us have woven into our beings because that's the orientation that's been
[0:32:33] SPEAKER_00: passed down and passed down and we're busting out of it.
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_00: But it's a pretty old habit.
[0:32:40] SPEAKER_00: And so if we, the superstition can filter in in other places, right?
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_00: So if we're not engaged in some kind of spiritual practice that says I need to turn
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_00: in circle three times and say what I'm grateful for and, you know, and then I'll
[0:32:51] SPEAKER_00: get my treats, then it comes in in more subtle ways.
[0:32:56] SPEAKER_00: So recently, one of the ways that kind of cancel clear ways that I was noticing it
[0:33:03] Unknown: happening for me, um, I was talking about this a little bit, the last episode we
[0:33:07] SPEAKER_00: recorded that I'm having this new vantage point and energy level for noticing my
[0:33:14] SPEAKER_00: money stuff.
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_00: So when I log in on my bank account and I feel gross and I'm like, all right, money,
[0:33:19] SPEAKER_00: let's do this thing.
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_00: And that isn't like a, I love this.
[0:33:26] SPEAKER_00: I'm cancel clear, right?
[0:33:28] SPEAKER_00: Like I, I'm going to turn that angry feeling into a like, here I am bank
[0:33:33] SPEAKER_00: account, late party.
[0:33:35] Unknown: What it actually can be.
[0:33:37] Unknown: And like, I just moved today, as you know, so that just involves a certain amount of
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_00: money going out, not a big deal money you expect to go out, but like you're paying
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_00: bigger bills for a little while.
[0:33:49] SPEAKER_00: And so getting on my bank account, it was so refreshing to almost tempt the
[0:33:56] SPEAKER_00: lightning bolt and just be like, I hate this.
[0:34:01] Unknown: I hate it.
[0:34:02] SPEAKER_00: And just to be a little tantrumy and to really give voice to what was the truth.
[0:34:06] SPEAKER_00: I hate it.
[0:34:07] SPEAKER_00: I hate it.
[0:34:07] SPEAKER_00: I hate it.
[0:34:08] SPEAKER_00: I'm so fucking sick of every time new money shows up, something comes along to
[0:34:14] SPEAKER_00: snatch it.
[0:34:15] SPEAKER_00: And like, I don't have the answers.
[0:34:16] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, but I get to in this moment, be exactly what I am, which is
[0:34:21] Unknown: pissed off that something is repeating itself, which can disrupt some of the
[0:34:26] SPEAKER_00: superstition and some of the tendency we have to muzzle money.
[0:34:29] Unknown: Now, if that turns into, if, if ego gets ahold of that, it wants to prolong it.
[0:34:36] Unknown: And it wants to turn it into an identity like, yeah, I'm the one that's mad.
[0:34:41] Unknown: I'm the one that's mad about money.
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_00: And I'm going to stomp around like Godzilla whenever I feel this way from
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_00: now on, because ego makes it a permanent and forever like this.
[0:34:53] Unknown: If we can just let it be a very genuine, genuine, genuine, genuine,
[0:34:59] SPEAKER_00: moment in time, if that is what's genuine in this case, for me this week, it was.
[0:35:04] SPEAKER_00: How great.
[0:35:06] SPEAKER_00: But I can disrupt the superstition that I'm not going to get struck by a lightning
[0:35:09] SPEAKER_00: bolt.
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_00: Everything's not going to go to hell because I'm the most ungrateful, bad
[0:35:14] SPEAKER_00: spiritual person ever.
[0:35:15] SPEAKER_00: How dare I be ungrateful for my great life?
[0:35:18] SPEAKER_00: Or how dare I not be farther along on my path where I can easily do this and feel
[0:35:23] SPEAKER_00: completely at ease.
[0:35:25] SPEAKER_00: And I'm also not going, yeah, I'm going to be this one now.
[0:35:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to stomp around, get mad.
[0:35:31] SPEAKER_00: It's literally just the moment and things get so much softer and can unclog more
[0:35:36] SPEAKER_00: quickly, honestly, because we're just being whatever the hell we are in any given
[0:35:39] SPEAKER_00: moment.
[0:35:40] Unknown: And we're not using words to say, I am the angry one who's going to complain about
[0:35:46] Unknown: my money situation all the time when I talk to people, or I am the ungrateful
[0:35:51] SPEAKER_00: one, or I am the whatever.
[0:35:54] Unknown: So with superstition, it's interesting because I think we all have it to
[0:35:59] Unknown: different degrees in our lives.
[0:36:01] SPEAKER_00: Like where are we believing that we're going to get in trouble if we're just
[0:36:05] SPEAKER_00: whatever we genuinely are in a moment?
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_00: Where does that come up and how can we let ourselves be whatever we actually are
[0:36:14] Unknown: in order to break the hold of superstition on us?
[0:36:17] Unknown: It does have, I think these things do have subtlety to it.
[0:36:22] Unknown: I think it's why it can be very easily confused and grabbed onto and used
[0:36:27] SPEAKER_00: differently, right?
[0:36:28] Unknown: I'm remembering back while you're speaking to when I was in Miami and I had mold
[0:36:36] Unknown: illness and it was becoming clear to me that I had to move.
[0:36:40] Unknown: And my husband and I were having conversations like we have to leave our
[0:36:44] SPEAKER_00: home, we have to leave our city, which he loved.
[0:36:48] Unknown: And I was working with Cure and Trace at the time.
[0:36:50] Unknown: And of course, what was coming up for me was some of my core wounds.
[0:36:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm a weirdo being one of them.
[0:36:57] SPEAKER_00: But the other one being I'm a burden, which is one of the big ones, right?
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_00: And that's even the apologize for my existence.
[0:37:03] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm such a burden and making you get up right now.
[0:37:06] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:37:08] Unknown: And I remember her saying something to the effect, I'm sure I'll paraphrase
[0:37:12] SPEAKER_00: her wrong, but what she offered to me was don't be afraid of the effects.
[0:37:19] Unknown: And what she said to me was don't keep telling Mario you're such a burden for
[0:37:24] SPEAKER_00: making him move because sooner or later he just may believe your story.
[0:37:30] SPEAKER_00: And like you planted the story.
[0:37:32] Unknown: It wasn't real for him to begin with.
[0:37:35] Unknown: And I actually found that to be kind of Sage.
[0:37:39] SPEAKER_00: And that's what's interesting though, because in any given moment, it would
[0:37:44] SPEAKER_00: be easy to say that what was true for me was I felt like a burden.
[0:37:49] SPEAKER_00: For months as I was healing and needing all of this inside of myself and coming
[0:37:54] Unknown: to terms with moving and asking loved ones to come with me.
[0:38:00] Unknown: So at any given moment, it would have felt genuine to just say, Oh, I'm
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_00: so sorry, I'm burdening you.
[0:38:08] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry.
[0:38:08] SPEAKER_00: I'm doing this to you.
[0:38:09] Unknown: And there were certainly some where that it was what I was saying, but just
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: because that was there, does it need to be expressed outwardly?
[0:38:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm posing this as a question, not as a statement, like as an exploration,
[0:38:25] SPEAKER_00: because I think this is all interesting because to me, I really got it when she
[0:38:30] Unknown: said it and she was saying it for me with Mario in that moment.
[0:38:35] SPEAKER_00: So that doesn't mean it's a blanket statement for everyone, but I really got
[0:38:39] Unknown: what she was saying because I understand how you can help someone's mind, see
[0:38:45] SPEAKER_00: something a certain way if you work on it hard enough, right?
[0:38:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:38:50] SPEAKER_00: If you work on it hard enough.
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: And I understood that and I was like, it's true because in reality, I could see
[0:38:58] Unknown: with awareness, this isn't a true belief.
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_00: It's not grounded in anything, but when the belief comes up, feelings come up
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_00: with it and they can feel really alive.
[0:39:08] Unknown: And there could almost be some relief.
[0:39:11] SPEAKER_00: Like if I say, Oh gosh, I'm such a burden.
[0:39:14] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry to put you through this.
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_00: Like poor you.
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_00: It can feel like a relief because in that moment, he might then be like, Oh, it's
[0:39:22] SPEAKER_00: okay.
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_00: Oh, you know, I can do this.
[0:39:25] SPEAKER_00: Or even if he was worst case scenario to be like, yeah, it is really hard on me.
[0:39:29] SPEAKER_00: I at least feel like I'm apologizing.
[0:39:31] SPEAKER_00: I'm being the good person who sees that I am a burden and I'm apologizing.
[0:39:36] SPEAKER_00: So either that's going to make me feel better or he's going to say, no, no, no,
[0:39:40] SPEAKER_00: you're okay.
[0:39:41] SPEAKER_00: And then that's going to make me feel better.
[0:39:43] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:39:43] Unknown: So in the moment of expression, we could say it qualified as genuine and it did
[0:39:49] SPEAKER_00: feel that way.
[0:39:50] Unknown: And we could say, I might get some relief, but how many times the first time, the
[0:39:58] Unknown: second, the 10th, the 20th, the 40th, you know, at what point does it not serve
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_00: either of us anymore?
[0:40:08] Unknown: Does it not serve reality to be moving from a part of you that is just a wound?
[0:40:17] SPEAKER_00: Like not true.
[0:40:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:40:19] SPEAKER_00: Not not arising from clarity, not arising from love.
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_00: So I think that's where it gets interesting because I'm super into not
[0:40:26] SPEAKER_00: editing myself.
[0:40:27] SPEAKER_00: So I don't really do that.
[0:40:29] SPEAKER_00: I am mindful.
[0:40:30] Unknown: I will bring awareness, but like the whole, you know, we're using the words cancel
[0:40:35] SPEAKER_00: clear is just an example for what we're talking about.
[0:40:37] SPEAKER_00: That whole energy of, oh my God, don't use that word where you'll create it.
[0:40:42] SPEAKER_00: I've never really gotten into, I'm like, I'll do the healing until the right words
[0:40:45] SPEAKER_00: come out rather than edit like the branch to get to the root.
[0:40:51] Unknown: But I also understand there is a certain amount where like, you know, our brains
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_00: are programmable.
[0:40:59] SPEAKER_00: I mean, that is true.
[0:41:00] SPEAKER_00: And so are others.
[0:41:02] SPEAKER_00: And so how much do we keep moving from and speaking from what's ultimately a wound,
[0:41:08] SPEAKER_00: ultimately not grounded in truth.
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_00: How does it affect others?
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_00: But more importantly, how does it affect us both when we hear ourselves say those
[0:41:19] SPEAKER_00: words and when others may respond to us as if those words are true?
[0:41:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm really glad this came up because it's like important layers of subtlety.
[0:41:28] SPEAKER_00: Um, so some of the distinctions that I see between your example and my example, one
[0:41:34] SPEAKER_00: is like the, I'm a burden is on the layer of identity to core wound about your
[0:41:39] SPEAKER_00: identity.
[0:41:41] SPEAKER_00: Um, so my parallel in my circumstance would have been something like I am a
[0:41:47] SPEAKER_00: hopeless financial fuckup.
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_00: It'll never turn around for me.
[0:41:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm the worst.
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_00: So if I had really leaned into that, it would be, it would have been like a, I am
[0:42:00] SPEAKER_00: this, I am this, I really am this, you know, like that kind of thing.
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_00: But instead of being like solid and concrete and it's reinforcing, I am that,
[0:42:11] SPEAKER_00: you know, and instead it was, I see this pattern.
[0:42:15] SPEAKER_00: I have been watching this pattern.
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_00: I know that I am not it, but it is still here.
[0:42:21] SPEAKER_00: I experience feeling angry, frustrated.
[0:42:26] Unknown: And so in my case, it would have been a way of sitting on myself in that moment to
[0:42:33] SPEAKER_00: not acknowledge I feel angry, which was different than going back into the old
[0:42:38] SPEAKER_00: core wound person.
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_00: I am, it is hopeless for me.
[0:42:41] SPEAKER_00: I, I never works out for Brooke, you know?
[0:42:45] SPEAKER_00: And so that turning towards the, I see this with clarity.
[0:42:51] Unknown: This is just a belief system, a thought form and a repeating pattern because of, I
[0:42:57] SPEAKER_00: don't know why it's the mystery.
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_00: Plenty of things I could point out and plenty of things I couldn't point out
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_00: about why it comes to be.
[0:43:04] SPEAKER_00: And, and the feeling of anger, I've spent so much time and energy turning away from
[0:43:11] SPEAKER_00: and like, no, you know, this is just a passing phase.
[0:43:15] SPEAKER_00: We've been here before.
[0:43:17] SPEAKER_00: You're going to get through it.
[0:43:18] SPEAKER_00: All of which are very healthy things and behaviors and attitudes to take.
[0:43:21] SPEAKER_00: And they've served me quite well, but for whatever reason, it was pressurized in
[0:43:25] SPEAKER_00: this way where what really wanted to be attended to was, I just feel really
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_00: fucking pissed off.
[0:43:30] SPEAKER_00: Just feel frustrated and feel really tired.
[0:43:33] SPEAKER_00: And so because that was in that moment, so genuine and so wanting to be
[0:43:38] Unknown: acknowledged, it was liberating.
[0:43:41] SPEAKER_00: Because it was what wanted to be acknowledged and really seen.
[0:43:45] SPEAKER_00: And these things are so subtle and so tricky because that's very different
[0:43:50] Unknown: than thinking that the, like, it's such a relief to just admit that I'm a
[0:43:56] SPEAKER_00: hopeless case or whatever, you know, that's just identity getting its, you
[0:44:03] SPEAKER_00: know, hands around you and being like, yes, it is true.
[0:44:08] SPEAKER_00: So we have to play with it in ourselves.
[0:44:10] Unknown: And I think you use the phrase like what's alive in the moment.
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_00: The, the alive relationship to ourselves and our lives and these patterns and
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_00: how they move in us and how they shift and how they don't shift is, is such a
[0:44:28] Unknown: close and intimate thing that can't be prescribed.
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_00: We can't give the blueprint fix all for anyone.
[0:44:36] Unknown: Thank God, you know, that it gets to be everyone's individual journey instead
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_00: of somebody who has all the answers for everyone, because we've seen plenty of
[0:44:46] SPEAKER_00: people pretend that that's true and it doesn't work out great.
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_00: Um, so yeah, I guess it's like the way I picture it in my mind is how close is it?
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_00: Do you believe you are it?
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_00: Is it an identity?
[0:45:01] Unknown: Or is it taking the small world ride instead of being the animatronic in the
[0:45:07] SPEAKER_00: small world ride where you're like, I am watching this and I'm a human being.
[0:45:12] Unknown: I don't just feel like, you know, because I can see the pattern, I just feel
[0:45:21] SPEAKER_00: endlessly great inside because it's just a pattern, you know, in my experience,
[0:45:25] SPEAKER_00: that's not true.
[0:45:26] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes patterns are really, really light like that and they let go.
[0:45:29] SPEAKER_00: Very easily.
[0:45:30] SPEAKER_00: And it does feel quite soft, but we all have the ones that are more
[0:45:33] SPEAKER_00: entrenched for each of us.
[0:45:37] Unknown: I think even, even that differentiation, which was great, you know, won't always
[0:45:45] Unknown: be true.
[0:45:45] SPEAKER_00: So that's where it circles back to the fine tuning for you, because there will
[0:45:50] Unknown: be moments when even though let's say, I believe I'm a burden in a moment, where
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: me sharing that identity will be helpful and healing.
[0:46:03] SPEAKER_00: There'll be many moments, maybe with your lover, maybe with a family member,
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_00: you know, maybe with a friend or with your therapist or whomever, there's going
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_00: to be moments when bringing that out into the light has its own intelligence in it.
[0:46:17] SPEAKER_00: You know, speaking those words, because sometimes too, when, when you say
[0:46:21] Unknown: something, you yourself begin to see like, that can't possibly be true.
[0:46:26] SPEAKER_00: But the thought when it was like inside my head had more like heft to it.
[0:46:32] Unknown: And then I verbalize like, I have to apologize for my existence.
[0:46:37] SPEAKER_00: And like, even as I say it, I'm like, that can't possibly be true.
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_00: I get, I feel that way.
[0:46:43] Unknown: But, you know, so there's always going to be a time and place.
[0:46:47] SPEAKER_00: I suppose what was interesting to me about this conversation is just when they
[0:46:52] Unknown: become the ways we go to, like our default ways of engaging with the world.
[0:46:59] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:47:00] Unknown: Like how have we been taught with other people's words and other people's
[0:47:05] Unknown: actions and other people's lack of words to show up?
[0:47:10] Unknown: And how does that influence then what we choose to share?
[0:47:14] Unknown: How we share?
[0:47:16] SPEAKER_00: What about us we share when we are like these miracles that we have to
[0:47:21] Unknown: share, like these miracles who are full of so much we could.
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_00: And so where it gets most interesting to me is simply where you see patterns.
[0:47:30] Unknown: You know, so if like divine intelligence in one moment says, you know, open up and
[0:47:36] SPEAKER_00: share with this human you're getting to know that sometimes you feel like the piece
[0:47:41] SPEAKER_00: of crap who's never figuring it out.
[0:47:43] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_00: Like then there might be some real intimacy to be born from that moment or
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_00: some real healing right around the corner from it.
[0:47:52] SPEAKER_00: But if you notice that, you know, every time you meet someone or every time you
[0:47:56] SPEAKER_00: go on a first date, you're already telling that story.
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:48:01] SPEAKER_00: Or that kind of persona is coming out to play.
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_00: Like I have a friend of mine, she's so dear to my heart.
[0:48:09] SPEAKER_00: And she was struggling a lot about dating around dating.
[0:48:13] SPEAKER_00: And one of the things I noticed when I was sitting with her one night, two guys
[0:48:16] SPEAKER_00: started talking to us and they were very, you know, eligible looking men and, you
[0:48:22] SPEAKER_00: know, cute and they were talking to us.
[0:48:23] SPEAKER_00: Within 15 minutes, she told the story about how she was super drunk last night.
[0:48:29] Unknown: You know, she had like been hung over and like basically a story about her promiscuity.
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_00: And it happened in the span of 15 minutes.
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_00: Now this woman has a lot to offer a human being that goes beyond that.
[0:48:44] SPEAKER_00: But you can see, I don't think people should judge.
[0:48:47] SPEAKER_00: I certainly don't judge promiscuity like hello.
[0:48:50] Unknown: And I certainly don't judge drinking, but you can see how if you're just meeting
[0:48:56] Unknown: someone, depending on what story you tell, it changes how they're looking at you.
[0:49:02] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:49:02] SPEAKER_00: Cause everyone's trying to figure out like, Oh, who is this person?
[0:49:06] SPEAKER_00: What did they require of me?
[0:49:07] SPEAKER_00: What, what is it they may want?
[0:49:09] SPEAKER_00: Like what would make them feel good?
[0:49:10] SPEAKER_00: Like everyone's just innately trying to figure that out.
[0:49:13] SPEAKER_00: That's like an intrinsic mechanism of a human body that it's trying to assess that.
[0:49:19] SPEAKER_00: So I thought, well, if within the first 10 minutes, she said that they're
[0:49:23] SPEAKER_00: already now putting, they're like, Oh, do you want to do shots?
[0:49:26] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:49:27] SPEAKER_00: Like they're filing it into a certain compartment.
[0:49:30] Unknown: Again, I don't judge if anyone does that.
[0:49:32] SPEAKER_00: I have drank and I have slept around.
[0:49:35] SPEAKER_00: Just saying, right.
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_00: Do you, do you have any things that you're putting yourself into a certain kind of
[0:49:39] SPEAKER_00: persona and that you have a certain range of relationship?
[0:49:43] SPEAKER_00: Is all she wanted was like love in a relationship.
[0:49:46] SPEAKER_00: And then she's like, how come people are only seeing me as the fun party girl
[0:49:51] SPEAKER_00: that they go out with and they have a good time with.
[0:49:53] Unknown: And so anyway, that's obviously not all to the story, but it was an interesting
[0:49:59] SPEAKER_00: moment for me to, to observe and to be able to talk about with her.
[0:50:04] SPEAKER_00: And anytime we see those moments, like, I don't know, let's say you and I have
[0:50:08] SPEAKER_00: the opportunity now to speak to teachers, right.
[0:50:13] SPEAKER_00: When we do.
[0:50:13] SPEAKER_00: So let's say for the first time we met them, we were like, Oh my God, we
[0:50:17] SPEAKER_00: don't even know what we're doing.
[0:50:18] SPEAKER_00: We're so sorry.
[0:50:20] SPEAKER_00: Bear with us.
[0:50:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm not good at this.
[0:50:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: Like then do they want to talk for 75 minutes to us?
[0:50:27] SPEAKER_00: Like when we're at the science and non-duality conference, if we're
[0:50:30] SPEAKER_00: introducing ourselves, it's like we're newbies.
[0:50:32] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_00: We'd be so like humbled if you even came on, cause we barely know what we're doing.
[0:50:37] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:50:38] SPEAKER_00: We're probably not going to get people to want to book.
[0:50:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:50:43] SPEAKER_00: And I'm being sort of light about it, but like we do that in some way, shape or form.
[0:50:48] SPEAKER_00: So what I think is most interesting is just bringing your own mindfulness on
[0:50:54] Unknown: a really nice loving experiment, which is probably where self love at the base is
[0:51:00] SPEAKER_00: always the most important thing.
[0:51:01] SPEAKER_00: Cause then you don't have to shame yourself when you notice the pattern.
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_00: So always with that, but where you go, Oh my God, that's so interesting.
[0:51:08] Unknown: What did I just tell this new human I met or what did I just write in like 10
[0:51:13] Unknown: out of 15 of my texts, right?
[0:51:16] SPEAKER_00: Like that's so interesting.
[0:51:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:51:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm not a big Wayne Dyer person.
[0:51:21] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I'm not against the guy.
[0:51:23] SPEAKER_00: I'm just saying I haven't read his work very much, but a quote of
[0:51:25] SPEAKER_00: his has stuck in my mind for years.
[0:51:28] SPEAKER_00: I feel like I heard it 15 years ago or something, which is just that
[0:51:32] SPEAKER_00: you teach people how to treat you.
[0:51:34] SPEAKER_00: It's so succinct.
[0:51:35] SPEAKER_00: It's so simple and it's so true.
[0:51:37] SPEAKER_00: And it's always stuck with me because then it can just become an inquiry.
[0:51:43] SPEAKER_00: If we all are teaching people how to treat us, what am I teaching people?
[0:51:49] SPEAKER_00: And that is the alive exploration where it shifts and changes over
[0:51:52] SPEAKER_00: the minutes, days and years.
[0:51:55] Unknown: Uh, but it's interesting.
[0:51:57] SPEAKER_00: It's interesting to live that inquiry.
[0:52:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:52:01] SPEAKER_00: And to allow it to be an inquiry because it's what gets tricky is it's not about
[0:52:07] SPEAKER_00: necessarily then trying to find the good things to teach people because then that
[0:52:12] SPEAKER_00: can arise from just another feeling of deficit.
[0:52:15] SPEAKER_00: It can arise from you.
[0:52:17] SPEAKER_00: I need to be the optimistic one.
[0:52:18] SPEAKER_00: So lacking yourself in like a person, right?
[0:52:22] Unknown: Yet if we can have a really open hand of awareness and curiosity and play, like
[0:52:30] SPEAKER_00: at first just recognize you don't have to do anything, like start with what
[0:52:34] SPEAKER_00: Brooke said in the beginning, like start with don't do anything and then just be
[0:52:38] SPEAKER_00: curious, right?
[0:52:39] SPEAKER_00: Like, oh, that's interesting.
[0:52:40] SPEAKER_00: I'm observing aware.
[0:52:42] SPEAKER_00: And then at some point, the awareness may bubble enough where you're like, I'm
[0:52:45] SPEAKER_00: gonna try a fun little experiment.
[0:52:47] Unknown: I'm gonna try a fun little experiment where when I meet this person, I'm going
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_00: to tell them, you know, about what I'm really proud of instead of tell them about.
[0:52:56] SPEAKER_00: You know, what's really hard for me.
[0:52:58] SPEAKER_00: You know, like just as an experiment, how does that feel?
[0:53:01] SPEAKER_00: Does it feel genuine?
[0:53:02] SPEAKER_00: Can I stay in my body while I talk about that?
[0:53:05] SPEAKER_00: How did they respond?
[0:53:07] SPEAKER_00: Does it feel good?
[0:53:08] SPEAKER_00: Does it ship something?
[0:53:09] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[0:53:10] SPEAKER_00: Well, I did that thing again, where I talked about how hard it was for me.
[0:53:13] SPEAKER_00: Cool.
[0:53:14] SPEAKER_00: How was that in that moment?
[0:53:16] SPEAKER_00: Do I feel in my body?
[0:53:17] SPEAKER_00: They feel present.
[0:53:19] SPEAKER_00: How did they respond?
[0:53:20] SPEAKER_00: How did they treat me?
[0:53:21] SPEAKER_00: Did it feel good?
[0:53:22] SPEAKER_00: Did it feel aligned?
[0:53:23] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:53:24] SPEAKER_00: So it's like, gosh, we have to just be gently curious, gently curious, gently
[0:53:29] Unknown: curious, super inquisitive and be really alive with the whole experiment.
[0:53:36] SPEAKER_00: Because I think it's true for what we always talk about.
[0:53:40] SPEAKER_00: There's no actual rule book, but there really isn't.
[0:53:43] SPEAKER_00: It's why they talk about spiritual materialism or why Matt Konzo is changing
[0:53:48] SPEAKER_00: his teaching so that the ego can't quite grab onto it is because these things,
[0:53:53] SPEAKER_00: everyone wants it to go, okay, great.
[0:53:55] SPEAKER_00: So I never say what I feel.
[0:53:57] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[0:53:58] SPEAKER_00: Great.
[0:53:59] SPEAKER_00: So I only say the positive things like that's what we all want.
[0:54:03] SPEAKER_00: Bless us.
[0:54:04] SPEAKER_00: Mercy to the humans.
[0:54:06] SPEAKER_00: Um, but that's not going to get you in a live experience.
[0:54:10] Unknown: The alive experience is saying open, curious, self loving, other loving,
[0:54:16] Unknown: inquisitive, observing, conscious, aware, and then in playing with reality a little bit.
[0:54:23] Unknown: Thank you so very much for listening to today's show.

[0:54:44] SPEAKER_00: So we should have at least one more episode coming at you after this, but
[0:54:47] SPEAKER_00: then we're going to be on break for the very end of July through the month of
[0:54:51] SPEAKER_00: August, and that will include a social media break.
[0:54:55] Unknown: It's always nice to have some time to pause and let everything deeply marinate
[0:54:59] SPEAKER_00: or get the hell away from the iPhone or both.
[0:55:03] SPEAKER_00: So while we do that, you can have some integration time for yourselves too.
[0:55:06] SPEAKER_00: We will be back for sure in the fall, right around about the two year
[0:55:10] SPEAKER_00: anniversary of the show, which is exciting.
