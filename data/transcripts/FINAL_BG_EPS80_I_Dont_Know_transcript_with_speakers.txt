[0:00:24] SPEAKER_01: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Brooke Thomas and I'll be joined soon by my
[0:00:35] Unknown: dear friend and co-host Vanessa Scotto. On the show, we're talking about being on the embodied
[0:00:40] Unknown: spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is a real evolution of our lives? How do we
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_01: ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the
[0:00:51] SPEAKER_01: grit that is a human life. This week, we had the great pleasure of recording actually live and in
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_01: person when I got to visit Vanessa in Austin, which was delightful. And we also had the chance to be
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_01: together right after Vanessa's time on retreat with MatCon. So needless to say, we spent a lot of
[0:01:10] SPEAKER_01: our time together like the geeks that we are going over her notes. In this episode, we went over a
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_01: portion of our notes that we found particularly resonant. And we're talking about not knowing and
[0:01:23] SPEAKER_01: how and why I don't know is a powerful, clear, open and relieving position to come from. PS side
[0:01:32] SPEAKER_01: note, we have MatCon booked to come on the show in June. So we're very much looking forward to that.

[0:01:54] SPEAKER_01: wear headphones or think about the company you're in. Okay, here we go.
[0:02:01] SPEAKER_01: Hello, Brooke. Hello, Vanessa. Well, everyone, we're doing things a bit different today. So this ought
[0:02:09] SPEAKER_01: to be interesting. Brooke is actually sitting with me in my fancy recording studio in Austin, Texas.
[0:02:18] SPEAKER_01: We're very fancy people. It's exciting to be real and in person when we record. So you also may notice
[0:02:26] SPEAKER_01: a difference in the sound quality. So that's what's up. I don't know if it'll be better or worse. So
[0:02:31] SPEAKER_01: here we go. Okay, so I am fresh off of retreat with MatCon. And Brooke and I basically spent the
[0:02:41] SPEAKER_01: weekend, like dorks reading through all of my notes. So we can talk about and process and download
[0:02:49] Unknown: and share and bond over and connect on all the beautiful teachings and shifts that I experienced,
[0:02:58] Unknown: and then that Brooke experienced being a part of that. And we thought that there was something
[0:03:04] Unknown: really juicy that we could talk about today that I'm just gonna read to you. So I'm going to share
[0:03:10] SPEAKER_01: some notes that I took at this retreat with MatCon in Portland a week or so ago. And just to note,
[0:03:17] SPEAKER_01: it's a bit of paraphrasing. So I'm going to read you some things that came up. And we'll see where
[0:03:23] Unknown: we go from there. Ready? I'm ready. Okay, here we go. Most brains are addicted to the seeking and
[0:03:32] Unknown: processing of information. I don't know is the deconstruction of your human conditioning. You
[0:03:43] Unknown: don't wake up out of yourself, you wake up out of the fantasy that you know yourself. A break from
[0:03:54] SPEAKER_01: what you think you know about yourself is the solution to any problem. All the things you think
[0:04:01] SPEAKER_01: you know about yourself are actually the building blocks to having a personal problem with yourself.
[0:04:09] Unknown: To know is in time and is born of imagination, since you actually are always changing. So what
[0:04:19] Unknown: if the clearest view is no view in particular? You just see what you see and you put nothing on it.
[0:04:29] Unknown: Ultimately, a view is a reference point. Life doesn't need you to know anything, because life
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_01: is not separate than you. You're trying to know something about life or yourself, because you
[0:04:47] SPEAKER_01: think that there is something other than life, meaning you are other than life. Why keep track
[0:04:54] Unknown: of your story at all? So shall we begin to talk about the power and beauty of the words I don't
[0:05:06] Unknown: know? It is one of my very favorite mantras, as I've mentioned before on the show. And I'll just
[0:05:15] Unknown: sort of out myself that generally, but in particular with MatKhan's work, it's like I need to take it a
[0:05:22] Unknown: few words at a time, and then actually let it permeate me, meaning that I can feel it or experience
[0:05:30] Unknown: it or get some kind of like, aha, which I don't get with every sentence. But it's a slower conversation.
[0:05:39] Unknown: It's a slower way of knowing, because otherwise we're having a conversation about knowing how to
[0:05:47] SPEAKER_01: not know, which is a weird place to be and not particularly useful. So that said, for me, I'm going
[0:05:56] Unknown: to be repeating some of what you said, like some of the sentences, and how they strike me. But maybe
[0:06:06] Unknown: one of the things that we can do as like a container is how this relates to the way we make ourselves
[0:06:14] Unknown: into fixed and solid objects. And one of the sentences that that comes up for me is like, what if the
[0:06:22] Unknown: clearest view is no view in particular? See what you see and put nothing on it. A view is a reference
[0:06:29] Unknown: point. So to have a reference point is a way of fixing ourselves and the world in time, but also with
[0:06:41] Unknown: solid identities. And for me, like one of the things that's so relieving about this to me is so much of
[0:06:51] Unknown: the journey like for me, there's been a lot of the initial point in was therapy, which I think it is for a
[0:06:59] Unknown: lot of us or, you know, personal growth type work, or in my case, trauma healing. And there's a way that
[0:07:05] SPEAKER_01: it feels useful and also safe to keep understanding things about myself. So to go, Oh, I'm the kind of
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_01: person who or I've experienced these things, and these things have shaped me in these ways. And that
[0:07:20] Unknown: means that I am always going to. And I feel like there was a long period of time where that was
[0:07:29] SPEAKER_01: really, really useful. It really served like I was trying to discern I was trying to have some clarity.
[0:07:37] Unknown: But ultimately, I was also just trying to make myself safe by being fixed with these ideas of like, Oh,
[0:07:44] SPEAKER_01: that means that I'm the kind of person who but the problem with that is that as soon as I do that and make
[0:07:49] SPEAKER_01: myself an object, a certain kind of an object, and it holds it in place. So we did an episode not too long
[0:07:57] Unknown: ago about suffering. And I talked about the fact that I'm the kind of person who's wired towards
[0:08:04] SPEAKER_01: suffering and that I can make an identity out of suffering. So like, in one way, that's freeing,
[0:08:10] Unknown: because it's like, Oh, I see this layer of myself. But another way, it's a way the ego gets like
[0:08:15] SPEAKER_01: little tricky, little subtle and holds it in place. Ah, yes, I am the one who I am the one who
[0:08:21] Unknown: Ah, ha ha, like I'm on to my game. So that means that and it becomes a way of actually solidifying that
[0:08:29] Unknown: and and making that pattern or allowing that pattern to keep repeating. So I don't know.
[0:08:42] SPEAKER_01: Well, what I was thinking of when you were talking is okay, so holding all concepts lightly, it's not
[0:08:48] SPEAKER_01: that knowing is a problem. So we don't have to turn knowing into a problem. But what happens is the
[0:08:54] SPEAKER_01: mechanism that seeking to know is often operating out of an idea that there is a problem to solve
[0:09:04] SPEAKER_01: about us or someone else, right? So either someone else has a problem or we're a problem. And it's
[0:09:10] SPEAKER_01: seeking to know or understand so that it can solve this problem that is them or it can solve this
[0:09:17] SPEAKER_01: problem that is us. So when knowing drops into your being from an experiential state, we know
[0:09:27] SPEAKER_01: wonderful. But that's not it. I think what he was getting at, I think he kept talking about the
[0:09:33] SPEAKER_01: mechanism that seeking to know in order to like create ground that feels safe. Because once I
[0:09:42] SPEAKER_01: understand who I am, and what the problems are with me, I can fix me. And then I can get all the
[0:09:49] SPEAKER_01: things I want in life and be safe and be happy. Or once I understand the problem about that person,
[0:09:55] Unknown: I can fix them. And then I can get all the things in life that you know, that I need to make me
[0:10:02] SPEAKER_01: happy. And he said at a different point, understanding is our most primal way of controlling.
[0:10:09] SPEAKER_01: So a couple of things I think can show up when we're talking about the power of I don't know, and
[0:10:14] SPEAKER_01: conversely, the tendency to try to know one is, where is it like arising from? Usually when I'm
[0:10:23] SPEAKER_01: seeking to try to understand something, it's because I'm scared or I'm unsafe. I want to get
[0:10:28] SPEAKER_01: things back under my purview, I want to know how to put them in boxes, I want to categorize them, or
[0:10:33] SPEAKER_01: I want to fix them. And all of that is usually born out of my ego structure and survival mechanism.
[0:10:39] SPEAKER_01: And my ego structure and survival mechanism tends to only be able to assign meaning based on what
[0:10:47] Unknown: it's already experienced or witnessed. Right? So the way that the survival aspect of your brain
[0:10:54] SPEAKER_01: works, and this is neuroscience, but it's also very experiential, is it projects what it knows
[0:11:00] Unknown: from the past onto your present and future. So most of the time, if I'm operating from the level
[0:11:08] SPEAKER_01: of my ego structure, and I'm trying to know something, because I have to know something,
[0:11:12] SPEAKER_01: because it'll make me feel better, it will change my life, or it'll make my relationship better,
[0:11:16] SPEAKER_01: or whatever it is, I'm usually coming from the level of my ego survival structure. And then I'm
[0:11:23] SPEAKER_01: trying to apply meaning or create a reference point or view. But it's based on only what I've
[0:11:29] Unknown: already been through or witnessed. And that's usually a bunch of inherited Kabbaltikook. So I
[0:11:40] Unknown: think, you know, when you start to look at, you know, okay, so what's the actual dilemma, if we
[0:11:46] SPEAKER_01: get nuanced, it's like, well, what's the intentionality you approach this whole conversation of knowing?
[0:11:51] SPEAKER_01: And B, like, what energy is it coming from? Is it coming from fear? Is it coming from control? Is it
[0:11:57] SPEAKER_01: coming from the solidification of a problem that you could then solve? And B, we imagine that if we
[0:12:05] SPEAKER_01: really seek to, we can know, right? Like we imagine, especially if we look at ourselves,
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_01: that or anyone else, like any human being, or even any being, any sentient being, we imagine that we
[0:12:18] SPEAKER_01: can see through our conceptual filters and know them.
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_01: Right. And that's totally the like, mega uber blind spot that we're stuck under is like, we think
[0:12:28] SPEAKER_01: we're dealing with a neutral ground, you know, and that we are neutral ground. And then we can, we
[0:12:35] SPEAKER_01: can know we can know about the world out there, we can know in a very, like, clean, unattached way
[0:12:41] Unknown: about ourselves, if we're coming from the level of ego, the level of thinking mind, like you said,
[0:12:46] Unknown: they're actually it's worth pointing out that there is such a thing as something, you know, landing,
[0:12:54] SPEAKER_01: which is more of the like, ah, you know, like a sudden disruption.
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_01: Like, of course, I learned that from here. Of course, in my discernment, this is that right? Or
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: like, oh, you know, a very simple example that I think we've all been through is like, maybe we met
[0:13:14] Unknown: someone, a new boss or a friend of a friend or whatever first meeting of a person. And we had a
[0:13:23] SPEAKER_01: bunch of conceptual filters in advance of how it was going to go like, well, they're a friend of my
[0:13:26] Unknown: friend. So of course, I'm going to like them or I hope I like them or whatever the filters are. And
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_01: maybe we bump up against when the meeting actually happens an experience of I don't like that, like I
[0:13:40] SPEAKER_01: just viscerally like, just can't, the conversation is stilted. And I just, I just don't feel good
[0:13:47] Unknown: around this person. Just it's not a match. Then that is a is a disrupt. And it's like what we do
[0:13:54] SPEAKER_01: oftentimes is we keep running our conceptual filter, like, no, no, no, I'm sure it's fine. We kind of
[0:13:59] Unknown: override our direct knowing. And then there's the moment of like, allowing ourselves to have
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_01: whatever our actual knowing was like, Oh, yeah, right. No, I knew that I felt that all along. So
[0:14:11] Unknown: that's like a landing of awareness, maybe we could say some awareness that we have that landed in us,
[0:14:19] SPEAKER_01: which is completely different. And I just want to circle back to what you're saying about time. And
[0:14:26] Unknown: to requote Matt, where was it? Ah, to know is in time, and is born of imagination. So born of
[0:14:37] SPEAKER_01: imagination. Like in that example, it's like the idea of how this meeting is going to go or like
[0:14:43] Unknown: you're saying we have all these filters based on our past experiences, what we were told we are what
[0:14:50] SPEAKER_01: told the world is. And so we're just holding in place the things that are causing us to suffer in
[0:14:58] SPEAKER_01: the first place. Well, what's funny about the example you gave is so let's say you meet that
[0:15:02] SPEAKER_01: person, you get triggered by them. So you experience something in your body and relationship,
[0:15:07] SPEAKER_01: you don't even know if it has to do with them personally, that you don't even know, because
[0:15:12] SPEAKER_01: it's like, well, maybe, you know, the way my survival system works, like on a on a basic level,
[0:15:18] SPEAKER_01: is it goes, how familiar is this to something I've been through in my past. And if it feels
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_01: familiar enough, for whatever reason that the mind assigned it as familiar, maybe I'm meeting a
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_01: plenty fine person. But I'm like, that person is dangerous. You know, like, I feel really scared
[0:15:35] SPEAKER_01: around them. And you know, I remember going through this when I was in an acupuncture clinic at
[0:15:41] SPEAKER_01: Pacific College, there was a woman who had been really traumatized by a man with a beard. And then
[0:15:46] SPEAKER_01: one of my colleagues who was the sweetest man had a beard, and she could not be treated by him,
[0:15:53] SPEAKER_01: she could not see past like, the alarm bells that were rising every time she was around this guy.
[0:15:59] SPEAKER_01: But what she could know was, there's a trigger in my body, something is activated. And then before
[0:16:06] SPEAKER_01: she even knows what the trigger like, why is this activation occurring of this feeling in my body,
[0:16:13] SPEAKER_01: she could go, well, what is the feeling? Okay, it's anxiety. Okay, anxiety. How can I meet you?
[0:16:18] SPEAKER_01: She can get curious about the anxiety and it may turn out like, oh, in my discernment,
[0:16:23] SPEAKER_01: no thanks to this person, or it may turn out holy crap, that guy reminds me of something
[0:16:30] SPEAKER_01: that's still really hurting inside, right? So even that is so funny, because we assume that
[0:16:36] SPEAKER_01: it's our body. So everything that arises in my body, I have purview on and I know,
[0:16:42] SPEAKER_01: and even that can be an interesting mystery.
[0:16:48] Unknown: So maybe addressing some of what I think comes up for most people, what comes up for me for sure,
[0:16:56] Unknown: because there's a way that surrendering into not knowing can be, and Omodama talked about this a
[0:17:02] SPEAKER_01: lot in our lovely conversation with her, it can actually be so liberating and so deeply intimate,
[0:17:08] SPEAKER_01: like the relationship with life, with whatever's happening in your life becomes so much more alive
[0:17:15] Unknown: and available and intimate, because you're not holding things in place with your concepts,
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_01: your filters, all of the stuff, you know, from your past that just gets projected onto the present
[0:17:29] Unknown: moment. But I think that since we have most of us a limited number of those experiences,
[0:17:39] SPEAKER_01: what the ego feels when it talks about this kind of surrender is some of the things that can come
[0:17:45] Unknown: up, some of the trickiness is like hopeless, helpless, confused, like, oh, and of course,
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_01: the ego makes it moves very quickly, in my experience to make it into a concept, like,
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_01: okay, I'm not supposed to know anything. And then it starts making the the I don't know identity,
[0:18:04] Unknown: which is maybe the spacey person, or maybe it's the I don't know, it's all good with God person,
[0:18:13] Unknown: or like whatever it is. And then that's a person who's just kind of caught in a certain purgatory.
[0:18:21] SPEAKER_01: There's like this fuzz around. Yeah, then it can just become a spiritual identity. And you can
[0:18:26] SPEAKER_01: ground in the I don't know as an identity, rather as this alive process of curiosity.
[0:18:32] SPEAKER_01: Right, right. And I'm wondering for myself, like I'm doing this in real time, it's not because I'm
[0:18:36] Unknown: like, I have the answers of how this goes. But like, what are some of the things we might be able to
[0:18:43] SPEAKER_01: point to about when I don't know is letting go into a much more intimate, and real and genuine
[0:18:54] SPEAKER_01: relationship with life where things can move however they want to move instead of based on
[0:18:58] SPEAKER_01: our projections of everything that's ever come before, versus when we're solidifying into a new
[0:19:04] Unknown: identity. So like, I mean, for me, one of the things I would say is, like, I can read these
[0:19:13] SPEAKER_01: quotes, or Matt's work or listen to some of his talks from a conceptual place. And if I'm feeling
[0:19:20] Unknown: agitated, if I go to shame and blame of the self, like, oh, I've been trying to figure it out,
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_01: I've been, you know, shame on me, I just need to surrender, why can't I surrender? And all those
[0:19:34] SPEAKER_01: ideas about like, that you can will your way into letting go of something, which is the ego perspective.
[0:19:41] Unknown: Those are feelings that are very uncomfortable and disorienting versus when they actually
[0:19:49] Unknown: land in a way that's like, oh my god, so relieving. What a relief to not have to know.
[0:19:56] SPEAKER_01: And I think one of the things that gets in the way for me is like,
[0:20:01] Unknown: an experience of being safe in life, that life itself is a safe place to be, that if I'm deeply
[0:20:11] Unknown: intimate with it, because the ego jumps ahead and creates concepts and creates layers and
[0:20:20] SPEAKER_01: knows things as a imaginary way of getting safety, you're saying getting ground under the feet.
[0:20:31] SPEAKER_01: So I guess I'm just wanting to like disrupt a little bit the tendency of all the ick that
[0:20:36] Unknown: happens when we develop an identity around this. Like, I shouldn't be trying to know things, I,
[0:20:42] SPEAKER_01: whatever it is, or I'm the confused one, or I'm the spacey one, or versus like, how do we let it
[0:20:51] SPEAKER_01: permeate? Well, I think if we keep it close to ourself,
[0:20:56] SPEAKER_01: right, just close to that was the example you gave, like when I'm like, oh, I'm the worst,
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to figure it out, I shouldn't be trying to figure it out, you know, all that,
[0:21:03] Unknown: if we keep it close to ourselves, one of the things Matt was pointing to is people don't have
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_01: problems, objects have problems, right? So the ego is great at trying to fix an object that is
[0:21:19] SPEAKER_01: has a problem, like my clock is broken, my car is broken, I should fix this, right? This is a
[0:21:23] SPEAKER_01: problem. Oh, I run a business and the numbers are in, you know, the red and like, how do I solve this?
[0:21:30] SPEAKER_01: But when it starts to come to us, as we try to turn ourselves into a problem to solve,
[0:21:36] SPEAKER_01: there's already this objectification as if there's two parts of us, like as if we're not
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_01: whole, nevermind, like we're not even life, we're not even unified. There's that like,
[0:21:47] SPEAKER_01: problem seeking part of ourselves, and then a part of ourselves that is a problem to seek.
[0:21:54] SPEAKER_01: And we're constantly on the lookout for what am I doing wrong? So even when you hear what if
[0:22:01] Unknown: you could just rest in I don't know, it's like, I can't rest and I don't know, I'm a huge problem.
[0:22:10] SPEAKER_01: And as soon as we say that, we're ready to finding a knowing upon ourselves. So I mean,
[0:22:14] SPEAKER_01: the whole thing is funny. It's like what we're looking for, not that the words have any
[0:22:18] SPEAKER_01: significance, but rather a loosening in our being of, ah, what if I don't have to be a problem?
[0:22:26] SPEAKER_01: What if I don't have to know everything? What if I can't know everything about myself? What if I
[0:22:32] SPEAKER_01: already know everything I need to know about myself? And as I need to know more, it arises,
[0:22:38] SPEAKER_01: like, what if I don't have to go on the lookout for all of the ways that I am flawed, or unsafe,
[0:22:46] SPEAKER_01: or unworthy, right, which is, I think, really where this tends to kind of get us caught. So
[0:22:53] Unknown: I guess I experienced relief around it in the same way, probably that we talk about identities.
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_01: I mean, all of us probably relate to at some point having a very constricting identity.
[0:23:07] SPEAKER_01: So the identity that I'm the one who always feels unlovable.
[0:23:11] SPEAKER_01: Mm-hmm. Now, I agree with you, Brooke. I wanted to circle back to saying,
[0:23:18] SPEAKER_01: like, therapy was very helpful to me, and understanding my narrative is helpful. Like,
[0:23:24] SPEAKER_01: oh, this had me feeling this way, and this had me feeling this way. And when they did this to me,
[0:23:30] SPEAKER_01: ah, I developed a belief that, and, you know, if you look at attachment theory, understanding
[0:23:37] SPEAKER_01: your life and your story and, like, kind of what happened to you as a being
[0:23:42] Unknown: is considered healthy and very helpful. And even as we're talking now, like, understanding, oh,
[0:23:49] SPEAKER_01: when I was around my mother and she was bathing in anxiety, I kind of just picked up that habit.
[0:23:54] SPEAKER_01: Like, things can be very useful. Where it can become tricky is then we can concretize ourselves
[0:24:02] SPEAKER_01: into the one who always. And I think that's what he was saying about time. It's like,
[0:24:06] SPEAKER_01: you're always changing, and you're unpredictable, and you're mysterious.
[0:24:12] SPEAKER_01: So, like, let's say, for example, with relationships, since love is always such a,
[0:24:17] SPEAKER_01: like, sweet, tender spot for so many of us, it's like, I'm the one who always chooses bad people.
[0:24:24] SPEAKER_01: Right? And then that can start to become an identity where we're a problem and we have
[0:24:28] SPEAKER_01: this problem that is this habit, and then we can start to, like, kind of cram ourselves into boxes.
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_01: And then there's no freedom for me to change on a dime. I mean, like, one of the things I found
[0:24:40] SPEAKER_01: really relieving, one of the reasons why I like Matt as a teacher, is I grew up and I had this
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_01: story that I was the one who was unlovable and weird and burdensome, therefore a problem. Right?
[0:24:54] Unknown: And I had this problem identity. And that seems like something you have to spend quite a long
[0:25:02] SPEAKER_01: time chipping away at and unhooking and loosening and then meeting with love and, you know, quite
[0:25:10] SPEAKER_01: a process. Right? Because it's me. So if it's me and it's so solid, it's in my body, you know,
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_01: that's how it felt. And then I went to Matt's retreat in January and out of the blue, this
[0:25:22] SPEAKER_01: part of myself that was committed to making myself into this solid problem and all of its
[0:25:28] SPEAKER_01: innocence, just that's how the ego mechanism works, went away overnight. So it felt, right? Who
[0:25:36] Unknown: knows what actually made that happen. So that's part of what's really relieving is to recognize
[0:25:44] SPEAKER_01: to recognize in all awe and wonder that we're not what we think we are.
[0:25:51] SPEAKER_01: Like the other line that I loved was something we didn't read yet, which is when we're taught
[0:25:57] Unknown: to speak, we're told how to see the world. That is really crazy. If you slow down and realize,
[0:26:05] SPEAKER_01: like your culture, your parents, your friends, your schoolmates, your religion, like everything
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_01: you've been exposed to told you who you were, how to conceptualize of things, what was safe and
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_01: unsafe, what was good and bad, what was right and wrong, you know, and you then have that in your
[0:26:25] SPEAKER_01: ego mechanism. I mean, that's what it's built upon. It's how to stay safe, how to be good,
[0:26:31] SPEAKER_01: you know, all of those kind of ideas that are born in dualism. So when we're trying to assess
[0:26:38] SPEAKER_01: ourselves as problems or when we're coming through the survival mechanism to look at why is this so
[0:26:45] SPEAKER_01: ouchy, but we're looking through the lens of dualism and there's a right and a wrong and
[0:26:51] SPEAKER_01: something is a problem here. Like someone's a problem. It's me or them. And, you know, all of
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_01: these different aspects that the ego just operates from as like a shortcut, you know, because that's
[0:27:02] SPEAKER_01: how the brain's like, it's easier. I don't want to have to assess every fricking situation. So it's
[0:27:06] SPEAKER_01: good or bad, right or wrong, safe or unsafe. And it's built on concepts that people handed to you.
[0:27:11] SPEAKER_01: And I mean, if I think about my parents handing me my concepts for life, I'm like, Oh, God, if I've
[0:27:16] Unknown: been operating, like assigning meaning, all based on what they went through, and how they see the
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_01: world and what they understand about human life. Well, yes, I have. Yeah, and what was handed to
[0:27:29] SPEAKER_01: them. Yeah, and what was handed to them. And like the way that that goes back and gets perpetuated
[0:27:36] Unknown: and I remember in January when you went up to ask Matt a question, it was such a great moment
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_01: because you you went thinking I'm going to ask a question about my health. But when you got up
[0:27:47] SPEAKER_01: there, you were like, you know, I just I wanted to ask you a question about my health, but I'm
[0:27:53] Unknown: realizing that I can't find a problem with myself or with anything. And he was like, Okay, you know,
[0:27:59] SPEAKER_01: so there's no problem. And you said something along the lines of but will it come back?
[0:28:05] SPEAKER_01: And I thought it was so great because he was just like, there's no reason to expect that.
[0:28:08] Unknown: And you realize how much is built on expectation that these things was just it's the horizontal
[0:28:15] SPEAKER_01: mind that a moda mod talked about to that all these teachers talk about. But in our most recent
[0:28:19] Unknown: conversation with her, where you take from the past, and you project into the future, take from
[0:28:25] SPEAKER_01: the past projected on the future, and it just keeps holding in place the same narrative that
[0:28:31] SPEAKER_01: was handed to you by your parents and your and your and your culture.
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_01: And that was handed to them by their parents and their culture and their peers. And it's like,
[0:28:43] Unknown: if we actually want to disrupt it, we have to be willing to first see that our ego mind
[0:28:51] Unknown: exists to make everything a problem. It's like this was from another Matt con talk. And I don't
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_01: remember exactly what context he was using it. But he was talking about it's kind of like playing
[0:29:01] SPEAKER_01: you know, fetch with a dog like it wants to go fetch something. So what's the problem here?
[0:29:07] Unknown: Go fetch, you know, and we keep giving it a something to go fetch evidence of right. So I'm
[0:29:14] SPEAKER_01: the kind of person who's really wired to suffer over much go fetch, you know, go show me the evidence
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_01: that that's true. And what if we can disrupt the like, like you said, there's no reason to expect
[0:29:30] Unknown: that. It was so freeing when he said that to you like, Oh, my gosh, I do so much building things
[0:29:37] Unknown: around it, what I expect. And the intimacy that a modem talked about, like that surrender, the open
[0:29:47] SPEAKER_01: hand, the free fall sounds so scary to the ego structure, because of course, its entire organization
[0:29:56] Unknown: relies on not doing that ongoing and fetching the problem born in separation. But to have
[0:30:04] Unknown: experiences of it, like, Oh, my gosh, I don't have to expect that anything's going to keep being
[0:30:11] Unknown: written the way it's always been written. And suddenly, there's this circuit break, and it's
[0:30:17] SPEAKER_01: like, Oh, and you can have a completely different experience of life. I mean, that's what that is,
[0:30:25] SPEAKER_01: is like, this whole new world rushes in from there. I know because, okay, so it's like, if the ego's
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_01: there, in in its like role, it's in its like, in its functionality for this body mind to be like,
[0:30:38] SPEAKER_01: Hey, are there any problems I should anticipate or solve or take care of in this moment? You know,
[0:30:44] SPEAKER_01: like it's doing its thing, it's just trying to like do its thing. But then it was informed with
[0:30:49] SPEAKER_01: all the crap and gunk from like other people's pain and misunderstandings. And so it basically
[0:30:58] SPEAKER_01: goes, Hey, how familiar is this to something I've been through in the past? And if it is,
[0:31:02] SPEAKER_01: I know how to assign it into its category. You know, I don't know if this is true. I don't know
[0:31:07] SPEAKER_01: what the ego is in the body, if it exists and like where it would, you know, occupy. But I think about
[0:31:13] SPEAKER_01: from neuroscience, there's something called the default network, default mode network in the brain,
[0:31:19] Unknown: right? And the default mode network is like, it's, it's the self referencing aspect of ourselves.
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_01: That's always like, what is this? What does it mean about me? Am I safe? Am I good? Is it good?
[0:31:29] Unknown: How will I succeed? You know, it's always self referencing. And it sort of loops around itself.
[0:31:34] SPEAKER_01: And they say it's not present. It only is bringing the past into the present or the future, right?
[0:31:39] Unknown: So I'm like, this is just part of our brain structure. And I don't know why it's part of it.
[0:31:46] SPEAKER_01: That's part of the mystery. But there it is. And then a lot of empathic, sensey people, hello,
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: shout out to all of you out there listening. I'm probably talking to most of you are like,
[0:31:59] SPEAKER_01: usually when the ego is like, where's the problem? Something hurts, right? Because the ego basically,
[0:32:05] SPEAKER_01: since it's your protector is like, I want you to feel good, right? I don't want you to hurt.
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_01: I want things to be pleasurable and convenient because that all signals safety. And it all seems
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_01: like what we need for health and well-being. So anytime something doesn't feel like that,
[0:32:20] SPEAKER_01: even if it's a wonderful growing process, the ego says, Oh, how do I get you out of this? Like,
[0:32:26] SPEAKER_01: where's the problem? Right. But most sensey people go, where's the problem? I'm the problem.
[0:32:34] SPEAKER_01: Show you the problem. And then it lists all the reasons why you're a problem. Like you ever
[0:32:41] SPEAKER_01: ask someone like, well, like, what do you know to be true about yourself? And it's like, wow.
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_01: You know, and it's like, maybe, maybe they'll throw in one good thing about themselves for
[0:32:52] SPEAKER_01: good measure, because we all are smart enough to know we should like something about ourselves.
[0:32:56] SPEAKER_01: That's pretty healthy. But most of the time, if you really think about like, what do you know
[0:33:01] Unknown: to be true about yourself? A lot of it will either be externally oriented, like I'm nice to people
[0:33:07] SPEAKER_01: or like, you know, I'm good at my job, or it'll be all the ways that we're screwed up. Right.
[0:33:14] SPEAKER_01: Because that's part of how identity gets built and passed down from generations to generations.
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_01: And so I think that's really where the interesting part comes in. It's like, what if just for 10
[0:33:27] SPEAKER_01: minutes? Like, what if when everyone was done listening to this podcast, and when we were done
[0:33:32] SPEAKER_01: talking just for 10 minutes, you didn't have to know anything about yourself. You didn't have to
[0:33:38] SPEAKER_01: be the person you think you are. And you didn't have to be influenced by everything you've ever
[0:33:45] SPEAKER_01: been through. But just what if for five minutes, like as an experiment, try it on? What would it
[0:33:50] Unknown: be like? What if you can be an alive, ever changing mystery? What if your partner could be that? What
[0:34:01] SPEAKER_01: if your child could be that? You know, what if your mother and father could be that? Like,
[0:34:06] SPEAKER_01: for five minutes, just try it on for size. And there is this tremendous amount of like, for me,
[0:34:13] Unknown: and maybe somehow when Matt's saying it, it's like, I don't know, it's a magical transmission
[0:34:19] Unknown: that's like coming through. But for me, whenever I get it, I'm like, ah, yeah, that's good. I could
[0:34:25] SPEAKER_01: take a time out. Yeah, right. From like, needing to go fetch the problem in me.
[0:34:31] SPEAKER_01: And coming back with me in my own mouth. Right. Exactly. You hear the problem again,
[0:34:35] Unknown: and let me show you how. Yeah, I mean, I'd kind of like to actually answer the rhetorical question
[0:34:43] Unknown: he asks. Why keep track of your story at all? Because I can watch how my ego has a lot of great
[0:34:52] SPEAKER_01: answers to that question. Why should keep track of my should keep track of your story because,
[0:34:57] SPEAKER_01: you know, it keeps you safe, you won't repeat your same mistakes again. You'll understand why
[0:35:04] SPEAKER_01: you're doing things you'll maybe you can make a better goal, and then achieve that goal. And then
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_01: your needs will be met. And then you'll be happy because you won't be doing the same story. But
[0:35:15] SPEAKER_01: when I go deeper than that kind of quick moving thought pattern of like, I'll tell you why you
[0:35:21] SPEAKER_01: need to keep track of your story, which is what I've always done. You know, that's always what's
[0:35:25] Unknown: run. It's like, why keep track of your story at all? And then I can hear those answers that I just
[0:35:33] Unknown: gave. And it's like, is that true? Like, it does keeping track of my story, keep me safe? Like,
[0:35:41] Unknown: so for example, I can think about choosing a bad partner having a really bad experience there,
[0:35:49] Unknown: right? And it's like, do I need to keep track of? And then of course, that is not just one story.
[0:35:57] SPEAKER_01: Like, remember that one time you had a really bad boyfriend? It's not a story. It's a multitude of
[0:36:04] SPEAKER_01: stories about why that happened, what happened to me before to make that happen? What's wrong with
[0:36:11] SPEAKER_01: that person over there to make it happen? And all of those those multitude of things. And it's like,
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_01: is it really true that I need to keep track of that story for it to not happen again? Or
[0:36:21] SPEAKER_01: if I'm really not keeping track of my story, and I'm not needing to know things, and I'm not needing
[0:36:27] Unknown: to fetch the problem. And so I'm really deeply intimate with life. If I meet someone, and we're
[0:36:35] Unknown: flirting, what held that in place? Like, what allowed, let's say the Velcro mesh to attach to
[0:36:44] SPEAKER_01: one another in the first place, in my example, in a really bad partnership. It was all the belief
[0:36:50] SPEAKER_01: systems I had about myself in the first place. I'm unlovable. Oh my god, I can't believe this
[0:36:55] SPEAKER_01: magical person with this big persona is paying attention to me. I never thought I would find
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_01: love again, but here it is. Better grab onto this one and hold on because if this doesn't work,
[0:37:07] SPEAKER_01: nothing will ever work. You know, it's like the only thing that Velcro to bad partnership,
[0:37:12] Unknown: and held it in place as an experience, were keeping track of my story. If I don't keep
[0:37:20] SPEAKER_01: track of my story, it's just a very simple, do I like this? Yes, no. And the answer in real time
[0:37:26] SPEAKER_01: was almost always no. So there's no Velcro. Then suddenly the Velcro little teeth go smooth,
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_01: and it's like, oh, I just move away from that. That's intimacy with life. So the ego thinks I
[0:37:38] SPEAKER_01: need to keep track of my story so I don't repeat my mistakes. So I stay safe, so I don't get hurt.
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_01: But the only things that held up in place in the first place were keeping track of my story.
[0:37:54] SPEAKER_01: I mean, the whole thing is such a trip. And our ego is trying to grab onto it and understand this.
[0:38:01] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to master this, and then I'm going to understand how not to know by knowing how not to
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_01: know. So please, everything is just like a simple grain of salt. It's like just what arises when you
[0:38:13] SPEAKER_01: imagine this or sit with this or hear the words. It's so funny because the problem is, as long as we
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_01: are, let's see, what would be the right way of saying this, if I could get a best way of saying
[0:38:27] Unknown: this? As long as we're seeing the world through the eyes of the ego, we can't let go of knowing.
[0:38:35] SPEAKER_01: We can't because that's the whole ego's job. So the ego's job is something's a problem,
[0:38:41] SPEAKER_01: someone's a problem, someone's a problem. Let's say it like that. Someone's a problem here. Who is it?
[0:38:47] SPEAKER_01: Who should I assign blame to? Oh, I don't feel comfortable assigning it to them, but I'm going to.
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's feeling guilty. So now it's me. And then it's like, oh, I'm feeling so tired of hating
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_01: myself. It's probably them, right? And like, that's just what happens when we see the world through the
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_01: eyes of the ego, when we hear through the ears of the survival system that is built on concepts
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_01: that are intergenerationally passed down to us and that have occurred to us over the course of
[0:39:15] Unknown: our own lives, surely. So the dilemma is the ego can't let go of knowing. So that's not where this
[0:39:26] SPEAKER_01: is going to land. It's when the soul, as Matt would call it, um, Lock Kelly, who will be interviewing
[0:39:34] Unknown: soon would call it awake awareness. Judith would call it fundamental consciousness, right? So there's
[0:39:39] SPEAKER_01: many different words, but when I'm going to use soul, since we're talking about Matcon's teachings
[0:39:44] Unknown: in this moment, when you see through the eyes of the soul. So it's like a perspective shift. It's
[0:39:50] SPEAKER_01: like a, it's like shifting dimensions, as we've said, or shifting to a different vantage point,
[0:39:55] Unknown: because the ego can only see in binary. So that was something that, um, Matt was talking about
[0:40:02] SPEAKER_01: is that if you look at the way the ego operates, like that operating system works is everything is
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_01: seen in binary in dualism. So if you think about the default mode network of the brain or whatever
[0:40:16] SPEAKER_01: part of us, I don't know what it is, but the way the default mode network works is the reason why
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_01: it reduces things to binary is for quick shortcut decisions. So you don't always have to use glue
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: coasts for every decision you make. Right? So it's like saving resources. So who knows? Maybe that's
[0:40:32] SPEAKER_01: why the ego structure works the way it does. But what the ego structure does is it tries to reduce
[0:40:37] SPEAKER_01: things to its most simple variance is a good, bad, am I right or wrong? You know, is it safe or unsafe?
[0:40:44] SPEAKER_01: And it doesn't hold things in this large container of, of insight. So as long as we're seeing the
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_01: world from a state of survival, fear is often an indicator where, you know, caught in it, unless
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: there's a threat in the immediate moment, then fear is an important signal. Um, blame, hate,
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_01: self self judgment, you know, these kinds of things can be our little indicators. When we're
[0:41:16] SPEAKER_01: seeing through that, we're always going to try to know that's okay. It's like in all innocence,
[0:41:23] Unknown: it's just the operating system. So it's almost like in order to soften into not knowing, which
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_01: sometimes just happens and like lands is because you're able to see through the eyes, you're able
[0:41:37] Unknown: to hear through the ears, experience life through the consciousness that we could call the soul,
[0:41:44] Unknown: call it whatever you want, right? Fill it, fill in the blank. And you and I have experienced that
[0:41:51] SPEAKER_01: it's like, I can be in heaven and hell, like in a five minute span, where like, at one point,
[0:41:57] SPEAKER_01: everything is like, bad. It's like, okay, I think I told this story once before, but it's just
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_01: interesting because I went to see this chiropractor. It's a Nuka chiropractor. And what Nuka
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_01: chiropractors do is they adjust your Atlas. And that has a profound effect on your nervous system.
[0:42:13] SPEAKER_01: And I'm so sensitive. I've such high levels of interoception right now. And I know what it feels
[0:42:18] SPEAKER_01: like to be grounded in peace. And I know what it feels like when I'm caught in divided mind,
[0:42:23] SPEAKER_01: right? So the guy's working on me and apparently he was working the wrong side. And what was
[0:42:28] SPEAKER_01: happening was my nervous system was cranked. And as my nervous system was cranked, I start to move
[0:42:32] SPEAKER_01: into survival and my brain starts to spit out some thoughts like, I'll never get better.
[0:42:39] Unknown: I'm the one I know I'll never get better. I'm the one, right? I'll never get better.
[0:42:45] SPEAKER_01: Everything costs so much money. This is the worst. I'm the worst. What a damn bit of luck to have
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_01: this body, right? Like it's just spitting out things as if they're statements of truth, as if I
[0:42:55] SPEAKER_01: know this about myself and as if it'll never change. Right. And this is all while he's working on the
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_01: wrong side and I'm getting crankier and crankier. And then finally tell him like, I'm getting super
[0:43:05] SPEAKER_01: cranky. And he's like, me too. And he's like, you know what? I think I'm working on the wrong side,
[0:43:10] Unknown: flips me over, works on the correct side. Spontaneous movement of my Atlas occurs.
[0:43:18] Unknown: My nervous system goes, and I'm like laughing and I'm like, everything is beautiful and I'm
[0:43:28] SPEAKER_01: beautiful and you're beautiful. And life is all of a sudden I had this different vantage point
[0:43:36] SPEAKER_01: where I can see things through the eyes of love and I can hear them through the ears of truth.
[0:43:42] SPEAKER_01: And like, I can bring heart centered consciousness into relationship with the mind, right? So all of
[0:43:47] SPEAKER_01: these things could begin to shift. So I think the problem is when we're like, fine, how do I not know
[0:43:53] SPEAKER_01: anything about myself now to be a good spiritual person? I need to not know anything about myself.
[0:43:58] SPEAKER_01: Usually we're coming from that level of consciousness. That's not capable of not
[0:44:03] Unknown: going to let go of the problem. Ready? Go fix it. So, you know, it's almost like how we can shift
[0:44:13] SPEAKER_01: into states of love, states of compassion, states of like openness, softness, tenderness,
[0:44:21] SPEAKER_01: Matt's entry point on some levels begins with curiosity. Like, well, if I don't, it's like,
[0:44:27] SPEAKER_01: almost like the Byron Katie stuff, right? Byron Katie is like the master of like, you don't know,
[0:44:32] Unknown: right? Like whatever you're thinking, you think is a fact. But if you apply the four questions and
[0:44:38] SPEAKER_01: like, is this true? And is this really true? And is there anything else that can be true? As you
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_01: start to apply that you realize, well, maybe it's not as true as I think it is. And that starts to
[0:44:48] Unknown: create like a huh, and a softness, right? Well, the mat would go one step farther. So there's this
[0:44:55] Unknown: great curiosity of like, is this a fact? Am I under threat? Am I a problem? Like, are these things
[0:45:01] SPEAKER_01: facts? Then you can start to see what arises. And then you can start to meet that with this like
[0:45:07] Unknown: loving space, which shifts you into a consciousness of your soul. So then you can be like,
[0:45:16] SPEAKER_01: Oh, my God, that's so fun to play with. What if I don't know? What if it's not as solid as I think?
[0:45:21] Unknown: And then I think we can get more play with this. Yeah, it loosens up the soil a bit. And I, you
[0:45:29] SPEAKER_01: know, as you know, sitting next to you, but I'll say for the other people listening, like, as I've
[0:45:33] Unknown: been here, I'm going through all this home buying stuff, like house that I was gonna buy, and it
[0:45:40] SPEAKER_01: fell through and blah, blah, blah. And like, this can be super agitating to nervous system,
[0:45:44] SPEAKER_01: really revs up the old, you know, safety survival stuff. And then we went through, you know, we're
[0:45:51] SPEAKER_01: not going to go through it here right now. But we went through one of the exercises together in a
[0:45:55] SPEAKER_01: park of like, inquiry, looking uncovering what are the different layers of belief they're operating.
[0:46:03] SPEAKER_01: At a certain point, things shifted. And it's literally I felt like I said, Vanessa, I feel
[0:46:07] Unknown: like I just recovered from the flu. Like, suddenly I have way more energy, not in a manic way, but
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_01: just like, like when you're finally crawling out of bed after you've had a fever for three days,
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_01: and like, ah, the light feels so good on my skin, and I can see the leaves of the trees. And, you
[0:46:24] SPEAKER_01: know, these are the markers that you've shifted into a different state of being. And, you know,
[0:46:31] SPEAKER_01: the shift the other way will come too. So again, it's like, in innocence, we can just, I think,
[0:46:36] SPEAKER_01: just noticing that there are different states is such a beginning towards more freedom. And then
[0:46:43] SPEAKER_01: we can have inquiry. And if there are moments, and certainly there are where I'm in a very compacted,
[0:46:49] SPEAKER_01: very triggered state, and I can feel it because I feel dense in my body, I'm feeling negative
[0:46:52] SPEAKER_01: emotions, my thoughts are racing, it's filled with belief systems about the problem out there, and
[0:46:56] Unknown: for sure the problem with me. Honestly, moving towards just any kind of softening, like when
[0:47:06] Unknown: it's really amped. And we've said this before, but like, find safety, find relaxation. And,
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_01: you know, it's like we recorded an episode, Spiritual Path is Not a Benzo, and people can
[0:47:17] SPEAKER_01: do this, right? Where it's like, I'm just going to turn towards the light, or I'm just going to
[0:47:21] Unknown: chill out. This is different. Like when your animal self has hijacked your nervous system,
[0:47:28] Unknown: and you're amped, please do find rest or safety. And don't give yourself an assignment like,
[0:47:34] Unknown: means I need to meditate, I don't want to meditate, like, whatever it is, nap, lay in the sun,
[0:47:42] SPEAKER_01: go to a restorative yoga class, get a craniosacral session, whatever it is, find rest. And I know
[0:47:47] SPEAKER_01: we've said that a million times, but I think it bears repeating because then instead of when it
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_01: occurs, we just make the problem more solid because it's like, I'm having the problem again,
[0:47:57] Unknown: what's wrong with me? We can go, okay, like that's what's happening now. How do I find some,
[0:48:05] Unknown: some tenderness, some softness, because the way that new perspectives are going to arise is only
[0:48:11] Unknown: from a nervous system that's capable of shifting states. Well, I think you can't also underestimate,
[0:48:18] SPEAKER_01: not that you are, but one can't underestimate the power of approaching yourself with genuine
[0:48:26] Unknown: openness and compassion and respect. Like it occurred to me, what I was getting the image of
[0:48:34] SPEAKER_01: when you were talking is when I first was learning a little bit of muscle testing,
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_01: I only learned a little bit of muscle testing PSO when I learned a little bit of muscle testing,
[0:48:45] SPEAKER_01: the woman who was teaching us was saying how important it is that when you approach the
[0:48:51] Unknown: person's body to do testing on them, you hold the mantra of I don't know. And like, I feel like
[0:48:58] Unknown: that's a very respectful way to me, the human, like I may have some discernments and especially
[0:49:06] SPEAKER_01: the longer I spend time with them, I may have some discernments that say, Hey, it seems like they have
[0:49:12] SPEAKER_01: this pattern active in them. And a lot of people who are listening, you all are so sensitive, you
[0:49:18] SPEAKER_01: probably can see some things, but there's also ways that we just cast assumptions on people
[0:49:24] SPEAKER_01: based on something that triggers us, which means something that we've been through in our life or
[0:49:29] SPEAKER_01: something we've already experienced. So it's like this really nice, respectful way, especially when
[0:49:33] SPEAKER_01: we're meeting a client or meeting someone for the first time, you know, to like, be like,
[0:49:39] SPEAKER_01: what if I didn't know everything about this person already, then what would it be like?
[0:49:43] SPEAKER_01: And I'm not saying that that's what we should only do. I'm super not. I'm just saying, isn't
[0:49:47] SPEAKER_01: that nice to imagine someone met you without preconceptions? Who is this being sitting in
[0:49:52] SPEAKER_01: front of me? I don't know. I don't know. That would be so lovely. Right. And well, the same with
[0:49:57] SPEAKER_01: ourselves. Like it's so respectful to meet one's experience with, Hey, honey, who are you? What's
[0:50:06] SPEAKER_01: happening? I don't have to know everything about you. You can speak to me, right? It's this like
[0:50:13] Unknown: super open way. So, you know, if you're in that state where you're like, Oh crap, my ego's calling
[0:50:21] SPEAKER_01: all the shots. Literally I'm in survival instinct 24 seven right now. You know, you can slow down
[0:50:28] SPEAKER_01: and be like, cause just start with something simple. Like, well, what am I feeling in my body?
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'm feeling tension. If I was to give an emotion to that tension, how would I describe
[0:50:37] SPEAKER_01: it? If I gave it an adjective, if it's a feeling, what would I say? Oh, it feels like
[0:50:45] SPEAKER_01: anxiety. I was going through something like this. The other day I was feeling
[0:50:50] Unknown: unincluded, which is one of my deep triggers. It's one of the pains I've experienced being alone,
[0:50:59] SPEAKER_01: abandoned, unincluded, right? And it was like, okay, well, what am I feeling?
[0:51:05] SPEAKER_01: And so instead of being like, okay, here's what I could have been like, well, my husband didn't
[0:51:12] SPEAKER_01: invite me to da da da da da. So the problem is that he doesn't include me in anything. Right.
[0:51:18] SPEAKER_01: And I could have known and solidified it, but what was really sweet was when I approached myself,
[0:51:24] SPEAKER_01: it was like, Oh, I'm having this feeling. And when I sat with that feeling, I'm like,
[0:51:28] SPEAKER_01: where's this coming from? Like, when have I experienced this in my life? And then it was
[0:51:32] SPEAKER_01: like, Oh my God, my mom has so much trauma around not being included. And like, my God,
[0:51:38] SPEAKER_01: my sister has been, Oh my God, that goes all the way back. And then it was like, um, kind of this
[0:51:44] SPEAKER_01: discovery. It was like a beautiful discovery. And the interesting thing that happens is because
[0:51:49] Unknown: you're meeting that experience with this respectful, open place, you actually can't be in your ego to do
[0:51:57] Unknown: that. So it requires almost a shift into this other aspect. John Prendergast would be like,
[0:52:06] SPEAKER_01: what does your heart know? That may say your soul, some right. So, but it's this other aspect almost
[0:52:13] SPEAKER_01: has to come to the foreground in order for you to have a gentle, open inquiry that doesn't know.
[0:52:21] SPEAKER_01: And that comes with tenderness. And so then I could almost sudden see things fresh and have this
[0:52:29] SPEAKER_01: whole trickle down. And I think then, then you can have movement, you can have release, actually,
[0:52:35] SPEAKER_01: no one needed to be blamed or made a problem because in that circumstance, no one was a problem.
[0:52:41] Unknown: There really was just pain that needed to be met. So yeah. Yeah. And you can see how the same exact
[0:52:49] SPEAKER_01: inquiry could go a couple of different ways from the ego's perspective. It could solidify it,
[0:52:52] SPEAKER_01: right? Like, oh yeah, I have this pattern. And so does my mom. My mom passed it on to me. Oh,
[0:52:58] SPEAKER_01: I'm stuck with this thing. You know, like this is how this goes in my family. Yeah. Um, but like you
[0:53:03] SPEAKER_01: said, when the, when you are able to shift states, when there's tenderness and like an affectionate
[0:53:09] SPEAKER_01: curiosity, something else starts to happen. It just starts to dissolve. And it's like, oh,
[0:53:15] Unknown: it's just much more simple. Like, oh, okay. It's not like holding it in place. And then things start
[0:53:24] Unknown: to move. But I think for people listening, like what you said earlier in the episode is just
[0:53:33] Unknown: the worthy exploration. Can you for five minutes just get really curious and you know, don't put
[0:53:41] SPEAKER_01: yourself on a timer when you're in a really agitated state, but if there's some capacity
[0:53:45] SPEAKER_01: for openness and ease in your system at any given point, like, can you just spend five minutes,
[0:53:50] SPEAKER_01: not knowing, not knowing you or your story or your problems or meeting your partner or your child or
[0:53:58] Unknown: your parent and just for five minutes, like, I don't know. Yeah. Try it on and see if it loosens
[0:54:05] Unknown: anything up. I mean, you don't have to ignore the aspects of your life that aren't working.
[0:54:13] SPEAKER_01: You don't have to ignore the aspects of life around you that aren't working. What it's an
[0:54:19] Unknown: experiment in is what if I didn't have to be a problem? What if they didn't have to be a problem?
[0:54:25] SPEAKER_01: What if I don't have to be an object that solid and never changing? What if they don't have to
[0:54:29] SPEAKER_01: be an object that solid or never changing? If I could see through that, like lens, if I could
[0:54:35] SPEAKER_01: look at it through that, what might it open up? What might it shake loose? What might be freed?
