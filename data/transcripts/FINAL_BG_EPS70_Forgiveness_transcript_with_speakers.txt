[0:00:32] SPEAKER_01: I'm Brooke Thomas, and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa
[0:00:36] Unknown: Scotto.
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_01: On the show, we are talking about being on the embodied spiritual path, and what does
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_01: that mean?
[0:00:42] SPEAKER_01: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:44] SPEAKER_01: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_01: The beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life.
[0:00:52] SPEAKER_01: We are still very enamored over here of our weekend on retreat with MatCon.
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_01: We decided to zoom in a bit on a day of the retreat where we very much dove into forgiveness.
[0:01:07] SPEAKER_01: It was a really depthful experience, and so as usual, we're attempting to convey a transformative
[0:01:12] SPEAKER_01: experience with words.
[0:01:15] SPEAKER_01: Also this is millennia-old spiritual wisdom to forgive.
[0:01:18] SPEAKER_01: How do we forgive?
[0:01:20] SPEAKER_01: How do we forgive ourselves when we can't yet forgive?
[0:01:23] SPEAKER_01: How do we at least move towards forgiveness and soften in that direction?
[0:01:29] SPEAKER_01: And also really, let's look at the perks.
[0:01:31] SPEAKER_01: Let's talk about the benefits of actual lived forgiveness instead of the typical you should
[0:01:36] SPEAKER_01: forgive.
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_01: You will be a good person if you can forgive platitude that we get.
[0:01:41] SPEAKER_01: Ultimately, the internal process of forgiveness can be the most powerful healing remedy both
[0:01:46] SPEAKER_01: for ourselves and also for the world.

[0:02:11] SPEAKER_01: So if you're in company where you don't want that to be heard, you can wear headphones.
[0:02:15] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:18] SPEAKER_00: Hi Brooke.
[0:02:19] SPEAKER_00: Hello beautiful.
[0:02:21] SPEAKER_00: Well, we're still very into what we got out of the Mat-Con retreat, aren't we?
[0:02:29] Unknown: Mm-hmm.
[0:02:30] Unknown: So today, we're going to talk about forgiveness.
[0:02:36] Unknown: Because actually, this whole year we've been exploring forgiveness, right?
[0:02:42] Unknown: It started with Kieran Trace and a class we did with her called Accelerated Healing.
[0:02:49] Unknown: And it continued through with Matt's retreat and some really interestingly powerful exercises
[0:02:58] SPEAKER_00: with forgiveness, which is kind of the thing with Matt, right?
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_00: Like he was talking about the breath and you're having all of these ahas on something so simple
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_00: as the breath.
[0:03:08] SPEAKER_00: And now he is talking about forgiveness, which like, duh, we all know about forgiveness.
[0:03:13] SPEAKER_01: We've heard it all before.
[0:03:14] SPEAKER_01: Right, breath, forgiveness, yes.
[0:03:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, why don't you throw in love?
[0:03:19] SPEAKER_00: Sure, love.
[0:03:20] SPEAKER_00: Be nice to people.
[0:03:21] Unknown: And like, there we have it.
[0:03:26] Unknown: So seems so spirituality 101 and yet totally profoundly life changing.
[0:03:36] SPEAKER_00: Which is possible that it's just kind of the words he's using to enter that state.
[0:03:43] Unknown: It's possible that it was the energy of the moment as the exercises are coming through.
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_00: And of course, it's possible that it was the right medicine for us at the right time.
[0:03:56] SPEAKER_00: But I've been working with this with my clients since that moment and have seen that a lot
[0:04:01] SPEAKER_00: of people are being impacted by it.
[0:04:03] SPEAKER_00: So I thought we'd begin with me just reading some of what we got out of Matt's talk and
[0:04:11] SPEAKER_00: then we could just dive into the conversation.
[0:04:14] Unknown: Sounds perfect.
[0:04:16] SPEAKER_00: Sounds amazing.
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_01: Sounds amazing.
[0:04:18] SPEAKER_00: You're doing it just right, Vanessa.
[0:04:23] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:04:25] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so this is all paraphrasing slash quoting Matt.
[0:04:31] Unknown: Matt never knows how good my notes are, but they're close to quotes.
[0:04:36] Unknown: So what Matt said was the act of I forgive you, the words and energy of I forgive you,
[0:04:44] SPEAKER_00: wipes the slate clean in another human's energy field.
[0:04:51] SPEAKER_00: Something you do inside.
[0:04:54] Unknown: We forgive so that we don't need darkness to motivate our life to shine brighter.
[0:05:02] SPEAKER_00: That one is such a like, I know, let's just say it again.
[0:05:06] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:05:07] SPEAKER_00: You zoned out.
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_00: We forgive so that we don't need darkness to motivate our life to shine brighter.
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_01: Oh hell.
[0:05:18] SPEAKER_00: Across the board.
[0:05:21] SPEAKER_00: Let's not use darkness as the only motivator in our life.
[0:05:26] SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's go on to the next powerful quote.
[0:05:31] SPEAKER_00: Judgment is the withholding of forgiveness of those in pain.
[0:05:36] Unknown: Man, that one is so good too.
[0:05:40] SPEAKER_01: Judgment is the withholding of forgiveness to those in pain.
[0:05:44] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[0:05:45] SPEAKER_00: And we do that.
[0:05:47] SPEAKER_00: Oh, we don't want to admit it, but we do it.
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_01: We all do.
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_00: We'll come back to that foe show.
[0:05:57] SPEAKER_00: We all need pain.
[0:05:58] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I'm sorry.
[0:05:59] SPEAKER_00: We all need to be cleansed of our pain.
[0:06:02] SPEAKER_00: So we need to be forgiven.
[0:06:04] SPEAKER_00: We all need to be cleansed of our pain.
[0:06:06] SPEAKER_00: So we need to be forgiven.
[0:06:08] Unknown: And you can think of mercy as may there be an end of your pain.
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_00: I love that word mercy from Jeanne Zandi, right?
[0:06:17] SPEAKER_00: Mercy to the humans.
[0:06:18] Unknown: And it's like imagining the idea that mercy is just may there be an end to your pain.
[0:06:24] SPEAKER_00: That that's a level at which we can practice the forgiveness practice.
[0:06:28] SPEAKER_00: May there be a level, an end to your pain.
[0:06:31] SPEAKER_00: And then this last little bit.
[0:06:34] SPEAKER_00: Hell is how we experience life when we are unaware of the power of forgiveness.
[0:06:41] Unknown: Forgiveness resolves pain and it gives us our power back.
[0:06:49] SPEAKER_00: With forgiveness, you become the liberator.
[0:06:53] Unknown: I'm just letting those all drip in.
[0:07:00] SPEAKER_01: So good.
[0:07:01] SPEAKER_01: I feel like I want to spend the whole episode just going, mmm, mmm.
[0:07:09] SPEAKER_01: Just super helpful.
[0:07:10] SPEAKER_01: Who doesn't want to listen to a whole hour of that?
[0:07:13] Unknown: Boy, the more we await, the better.
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_01: It just gets really super interesting on the podcast when all we're doing is going, mmm,
[0:07:26] Unknown: mmm.
[0:07:27] Unknown: I love that.
[0:07:30] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:07:32] SPEAKER_01: So I'll speak for myself.
[0:07:34] SPEAKER_01: So his, we did almost a full day on forgiveness there, didn't we?
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_01: It felt like, I mean, it's so hard to know what I'm actually recollecting, but it felt
[0:07:41] Unknown: like one whole day's theme was forgiveness practices.
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for sure.
[0:07:47] SPEAKER_01: Close to that.
[0:07:49] SPEAKER_01: And I really did leave in this funny way.
[0:07:53] SPEAKER_01: I know we talked about forgiveness and we were guided through forgiveness practices.
[0:07:59] SPEAKER_01: I feel so much lighter and so different.
[0:08:01] SPEAKER_01: And yet I cannot explain anything of what just happened.
[0:08:05] Unknown: I can't remember it.
[0:08:07] SPEAKER_01: I can't describe it.
[0:08:09] Unknown: I don't know.
[0:08:12] SPEAKER_01: And then I came home from the retreat.
[0:08:16] SPEAKER_01: Those of you who've been on retreat before probably know the old post-retreat high.
[0:08:20] SPEAKER_01: And then there's that moment in retreat, which I do every time where I'm like, this time
[0:08:24] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to be able to keep it.
[0:08:26] Unknown: Like this time I'm going to go home and I'm going to stay in heaven.
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_01: And I instantly got pressurized into exactly where I can't forgive.
[0:08:37] SPEAKER_01: And it wound up being two main areas.
[0:08:39] SPEAKER_01: And one is where I can't forgive myself.
[0:08:44] SPEAKER_01: And I think that for a lot of us, like it's funny because we can, as sensitive people
[0:08:49] SPEAKER_01: and as empaths, we can feel like that's selfish.
[0:08:51] SPEAKER_01: But I think for a lot of us, the inability to forgive ourselves can be one of the more
[0:08:56] SPEAKER_01: tenacious places to learn how to forgive.
[0:09:00] SPEAKER_01: And then the other place that I've really been challenged to forgive is how do I forgive
[0:09:06] SPEAKER_01: my mother and not in like a Psych 101 way, like where I have some concrete idea of early
[0:09:13] Unknown: childhood wounds or anything more like in our actual day-to-day interactions.
[0:09:18] SPEAKER_01: Like I love this person.
[0:09:20] SPEAKER_01: I see her fairly frequently because she lives in the same town as me.
[0:09:25] SPEAKER_01: And man, I just, I don't know if anyone listening has had this experience, but I spend, you
[0:09:30] SPEAKER_01: know, a sizable portion of my time having mental arguments with her and about how I'm
[0:09:35] Unknown: going to shake her out of her naivete so that she sees things my way.
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_01: And I'm sure she's doing the exact same thing in the place where we butt heads mostly is
[0:09:47] Unknown: political.
[0:09:51] Unknown: And it's been so interesting because it's like we had this deep steeping into forgiveness.
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_01: And then like I come back to my life and I get to have the very human experience of
[0:10:02] Unknown: even after all that, like not knowing how in the most tenacious places for myself, not
[0:10:09] SPEAKER_01: knowing how to move towards forgiveness in these two really lump like hard to forgive
[0:10:14] SPEAKER_01: places.
[0:10:16] SPEAKER_01: And the best that I've got, like I'm curious to hear you riff off of this and what your
[0:10:20] SPEAKER_01: thoughts are, especially as you've been working with clients around this.
[0:10:25] SPEAKER_01: The closest that I've got, like first of all, it's almost like I'm being tormented because
[0:10:31] SPEAKER_01: it keeps it's meaning, whatever consciousness or whatever, bringing forward all the thoughts
[0:10:35] SPEAKER_01: about why I can't forgive myself.
[0:10:38] SPEAKER_01: And then lots of mental arguments with my mom that I just catch constantly doing the
[0:10:42] Unknown: mental arguing with my mom.
[0:10:46] SPEAKER_01: And then I can't move towards forgiveness.
[0:10:48] SPEAKER_01: And so the best I've got is like, I wish I could, which is also from MatCon, like take,
[0:10:54] SPEAKER_01: find a step you can actually take.
[0:10:56] SPEAKER_01: Because you have to, and one of his spiritual rules was to heal from your pain, you have
[0:11:01] SPEAKER_01: to go through it honestly.
[0:11:03] Unknown: Meaning you have to really realize when you can't go there quite yet.
[0:11:07] SPEAKER_01: And so to go through it honestly, to go through it dishonestly would be to say, oh yeah,
[0:11:11] SPEAKER_01: I'll say the thing and I'll say it every day and shut up, mind, stop mentally arguing
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_01: with your mom and shut up, mind, stop giving yourself evidence about why you personally
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_01: don't deserve to be forgiven by yourself.
[0:11:21] SPEAKER_01: And you're personally the worst person in the world who's made the worst errors, you
[0:11:24] Unknown: know, like.
[0:11:27] SPEAKER_01: And instead to just do the step I can take, which is basically a prayer, you know, just
[0:11:34] Unknown: a really sincere prayer of I wish I could, I wish I could find a way to forgive my mother
[0:11:40] Unknown: and let go of this mental banter and arguing.
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_01: I wish I could find a way to forgive myself.
[0:11:48] SPEAKER_01: And then just kind of let it do its thing, knowing like having faith that eventually,
[0:11:55] Unknown: like if that's a genuine wish from my heart, and it is, that it will find its way to me.
[0:12:01] Unknown: And right now, I don't know, it's a mystery why, but I just haven't been able to unhook
[0:12:07] SPEAKER_01: those particular hooks.
[0:12:10] Unknown: As I'm listening to you, I'm thinking about the, this isn't going to be the right language,
[0:12:19] Unknown: but sort of the power of individual experience.
[0:12:24] Unknown: I'm thinking about how John Lockley was talking in our other episode, like when people say
[0:12:30] SPEAKER_00: Kundalini and people say past lives, and he's like, what are you exactly talking about?
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_00: What are you exactly talking about?
[0:12:38] SPEAKER_00: Like break down the experience for me.
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_00: So I'm just imagining there could be six people in front of me who can say, I'm struggling
[0:12:47] SPEAKER_00: with coming to a place of forgiveness with my mother.
[0:12:51] SPEAKER_00: And for all of them, it may be a little texturally different, right?
[0:12:56] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, I get curious about like, well, where does the blockage come for someone?
[0:13:02] Unknown: So is it, I don't even want to forgive them, but I want to want to.
[0:13:08] SPEAKER_00: Is it every time I try to picture her, I shut down?
[0:13:13] SPEAKER_00: Is it, I can't find the words?
[0:13:16] SPEAKER_00: Because one of the things I thought was very helpful about what Matt did and that I am
[0:13:21] Unknown: able to then support my clients in, which is different than if I was doing this practice
[0:13:26] Unknown: for myself, is he gave us words.
[0:13:30] Unknown: And one of the things I noticed was his words helped me soften into what forgiveness really
[0:13:39] Unknown: felt like, like how forgiveness took shape.
[0:13:42] SPEAKER_00: So maybe there's something about the word forgiveness that has gotten corrupted over
[0:13:49] SPEAKER_00: time, the way words can kind of be projected upon and corrupted so that it still means
[0:13:57] SPEAKER_00: no matter what our rational minds say, sort of absolution, like you get a pass.
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, right.
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_01: We still feel like we're giving the pass.
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_00: I feel there might be a little of it, right?
[0:14:08] SPEAKER_00: Like, so if someone's doing something shitty or engaging in a way that we find,
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_00: you know, inappropriate or unethical or whatever the case may be,
[0:14:19] SPEAKER_00: we still have this energy of forgiveness is a pass on that.
[0:14:24] SPEAKER_00: Like, I forgive you.
[0:14:26] SPEAKER_00: And then now what?
[0:14:28] SPEAKER_01: Now you just do the things you do.
[0:14:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's okay to write whatever.
[0:14:33] SPEAKER_00: These unethical things.
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_00: And of course, baked into that is some idea that we have to stop people from doing unethical
[0:14:40] SPEAKER_00: things and that we actually can, right?
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_00: That we have control over your mother's politics.
[0:14:46] SPEAKER_01: Right, right.
[0:14:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:14:48] SPEAKER_01: My mentally arguing with her, yeah, or tangibly, you know, in person with my voice
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_00: will change anything.
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_00: Has the power, right?
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_00: If only you could just find the right words so you can't forgive her because you have to
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_00: stay in this argument because if you don't, she won't change and then I'm abandoning.
[0:15:05] SPEAKER_01: Yada, yada, yada.
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_00: And the world will be a shitty place and you've done it by not changing your mother's mind.
[0:15:11] SPEAKER_00: And of course, so there's all sorts of little hooks baked in, like,
[0:15:14] Unknown: I actually have some control, you know, like shaming another human being for what they're
[0:15:22] SPEAKER_00: doing that shameful actually changes something.
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_00: Like, if only I could show you the error of your ways.
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_01: You're wrong.
[0:15:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_00: So we have all of those little things.
[0:15:32] SPEAKER_00: But what I appreciated about when he gave us words, so let's say I picture someone in
[0:15:38] Unknown: front of me that I want to forgive who's hurt me.
[0:15:42] Unknown: And I say, I forgive you for not knowing better.
[0:15:46] Unknown: I forgive you for thinking that being in control was the way to be.
[0:15:56] Unknown: I forgive you for not seeing my feelings.
[0:16:00] Unknown: I forgive you for your humanity.
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:16:04] Unknown: I forgive you for thinking that the way you were taught to do things is the way to
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_00: continue to treat people.
[0:16:11] SPEAKER_00: And so all of a sudden, when the actual words are coming in, like Matt offered us,
[0:16:18] Unknown: right, there's something that begins to kind of soften in me, like something rearranges
[0:16:23] SPEAKER_00: so that it's not this idea of I absolve you for being a shitty person and doing shitty
[0:16:28] SPEAKER_00: things.
[0:16:30] SPEAKER_00: It's this remembrance.
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_00: Oh, my God, we are all so hurt and confused.
[0:16:38] SPEAKER_00: Hurt and confused.
[0:16:40] SPEAKER_00: And we've all forgotten how sacred we are and how precious we are and how how it's
[0:16:47] SPEAKER_00: right there for us to be happy.
[0:16:49] SPEAKER_00: It's right there.
[0:16:50] SPEAKER_00: And we've forgotten and we've somehow come to think that if only we taught someone the
[0:16:57] SPEAKER_00: right way or we shamed someone or or we controlled them or whatever, we've come to
[0:17:04] Unknown: think something erroneous will be the answer.
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_00: And in fact, we're just hurting people.
[0:17:13] SPEAKER_00: And so once I start to see it through the lens of mercy to the humans, like, oh, my
[0:17:20] SPEAKER_00: God, we are all doing this, all of us.
[0:17:24] Unknown: Something in me began to soften where forgiveness didn't feel like some mental
[0:17:31] SPEAKER_00: exercise like that we got at some point, you know, maybe in church or, you know, maybe
[0:17:37] SPEAKER_00: in Buddhism 101 that said, you know, to be a good person, forgive people, because, you
[0:17:42] SPEAKER_00: know, to not forgive people is like swallowing poison.
[0:17:44] SPEAKER_00: You know that old saying, something like not forgiving someone.
[0:17:47] SPEAKER_01: Hoping that the other person dies.
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:17:50] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:17:50] SPEAKER_00: And OK, that's a great idea.
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_00: But where does that leave me when I don't feel ready?
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_00: It just leaves me feeling like somehow I'm failing at being a good spiritual person.
[0:18:01] SPEAKER_00: But something about this felt like a softening agent where I can meet myself and the other
[0:18:08] SPEAKER_00: in that exact same moment moment in mercy to the humans.
[0:18:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:18:13] Unknown: And it's a funny exposure of this little narcissism that I think we can all have.
[0:18:21] SPEAKER_01: I'm sure plenty have transcended this as well.
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_01: But for most of us, it's like.
[0:18:28] SPEAKER_01: The people who deserve forgiveness are the people who are suffering the way I suffer
[0:18:34] SPEAKER_01: or the way I think good people suffer, right?
[0:18:36] Unknown: You know, like the people who made a mistake or are heartbroken or, you know, feel like
[0:18:44] SPEAKER_01: they're the worst when really they're just a divine, gorgeous being.
[0:18:47] SPEAKER_01: It's like they all deserve forgiveness.
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_01: Somebody who sees the error of their ways.
[0:18:52] SPEAKER_01: Of course, I forgive.
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_01: Sweetheart, you see the error of your ways, you know, I forgive you.
[0:18:59] SPEAKER_01: And it's really that simple thing that Matt is such a powerful teacher of.
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_01: It can be a boring sentence, but when you really live it, it's like we all deserve more love,
[0:19:09] SPEAKER_01: not less.
[0:19:10] SPEAKER_01: All.
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_01: All of humanity.
[0:19:14] SPEAKER_01: And when we do what is our natural human instinct for most of us and we
[0:19:18] SPEAKER_01: split people into categories of good and bad.
[0:19:21] SPEAKER_01: And when we get engaged in the suffering pissing contest, who's suffering the most,
[0:19:26] SPEAKER_01: who's suffering the most righteously, who's who's allowed forgiveness and who's not allowed
[0:19:31] SPEAKER_01: forgiveness, we just keep these things in play in the way that his quote, you know, it's like.
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_01: So that the darkness.
[0:19:39] SPEAKER_01: Gets held in place, right?
[0:19:42] SPEAKER_01: Because if we can't forgive or if we can only forgive the people who
[0:19:45] SPEAKER_01: fit into our category of what is deserving of forgiveness and,
[0:19:49] SPEAKER_01: you know, we're all human beings, so I'm not saying that that's easy peasy.
[0:19:52] SPEAKER_01: I mean, like I said, I'm struggling with that myself right now.
[0:19:55] SPEAKER_01: That's something that I'm really praying to find a way to open my own heart
[0:20:02] SPEAKER_01: and to forgive the cast of characters that I watch parade across the New York Times every day.
[0:20:10] SPEAKER_01: That's a lived practice, you know, but as long as I keep putting people into camps of
[0:20:16] SPEAKER_01: the deserving and the undeserving.
[0:20:18] Unknown: It holds darkness in place.
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_01: In myself.
[0:20:24] SPEAKER_01: But I would also say in the world, you know, it's an infection that can't be healed.
[0:20:29] SPEAKER_01: It just keeps agitating.
[0:20:32] SPEAKER_01: That's right.
[0:20:34] Unknown: I remember once hemichodron talking about.
[0:20:39] SPEAKER_00: I can't remember if it was forgiveness or compassion, since they're like such close
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_00: sisters.
[0:20:45] SPEAKER_00: Twinsies.
[0:20:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, twinsies.
[0:20:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, twinsies.
[0:20:51] Unknown: And she was saying something about, oh, I know it was like the may you be happy,
[0:20:59] SPEAKER_00: may you be free, may you be loved, you know, those kinds of aspirations that we share in Buddhism
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_00: and that we wish that it's a compassion practice, even for those we have problems with.
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_00: So if we were to just imagine, I don't know, someone like Donald Trump or something.
[0:21:15] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:21:15] SPEAKER_01: Let me, for example, pick someone named Donald Trump.
[0:21:18] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:21:19] SPEAKER_01: You ever heard of that guy?
[0:21:22] Unknown: If not, check the news.
[0:21:24] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry if you like him, but, you know, just to out my own my own difficulty in relating to his
[0:21:30] SPEAKER_00: character.
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_00: And so whoever is bothering you, if you were to picture them, your your brother who's been
[0:21:37] SPEAKER_00: unkind to you, your uncle who's been verbally abusive, you know, whatever the case may be.
[0:21:45] SPEAKER_00: What Pema was talking about is you wish them happiness.
[0:21:50] Unknown: And here's why Pema shared is because if they were happy, they would not do this to you or anyone
[0:21:59] SPEAKER_00: else ever again.
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_00: Remember, we're talking about genuine happiness, not pleasure, not I'm in a good mood.
[0:22:11] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:22:11] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_01: Look at me.
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_01: I'm on top of the pile.
[0:22:14] SPEAKER_01: That's not what we mean.
[0:22:16] SPEAKER_00: We're not talking about that.
[0:22:17] SPEAKER_00: We're talking about wishing that someone's heart will open into a state of natural peace and joy
[0:22:26] Unknown: and contentment, which is the resting state of awakening.
[0:22:31] Unknown: And that if that was to happen to them, they would see through the eyes of compassion, they
[0:22:37] SPEAKER_00: would see through the eyes of love, and they would no longer be your tormentor.
[0:22:43] Unknown: So Pema said, this is why we seek to want to want.
[0:22:49] SPEAKER_00: We pray to want to want.
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_00: I wish I could.
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_00: Such a great starter for a prayer.
[0:22:55] SPEAKER_01: I wish I could even want a little bit to move towards this.
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_00: Practices like compassion for others or forgiveness practices.
[0:23:04] Unknown: And I like when Matt says that it makes you the liberator because
[0:23:08] SPEAKER_00: sometimes when I talk to clients, I feel it's appropriate to note when someone has been
[0:23:14] SPEAKER_00: victimized by someone else.
[0:23:16] SPEAKER_00: I feel it's appropriate to note, especially when something bad has happened to someone,
[0:23:23] Unknown: something very unjust, something, especially when they were young or they didn't have power
[0:23:27] SPEAKER_00: to change it because of the politics or culture.
[0:23:32] Unknown: I feel it's appropriate to say you were victimized.
[0:23:35] SPEAKER_00: And that's why you feel such a way.
[0:23:38] Unknown: And yet what we can observe in terms of our own happiness, our own well-being, our own
[0:23:44] SPEAKER_00: lightness, our own brightness, our own functionality is that when we get smushed into
[0:23:50] SPEAKER_00: the identity of victim, it's highly problematic for us.
[0:23:55] SPEAKER_00: It's like torture.
[0:23:56] SPEAKER_00: I feel like whenever I felt corralled, like compressed, I felt like I was being
[0:24:03] SPEAKER_00: corralled, like compressed into identity as in I, Vanessa, am a victim period end of sentence.
[0:24:12] Unknown: What happens is I feel powerless in my life and I feel like I can't change anything because
[0:24:20] SPEAKER_00: these are all what define a victim, right?
[0:24:21] SPEAKER_00: We're powerless.
[0:24:22] SPEAKER_00: We can't change anything.
[0:24:23] SPEAKER_00: So all of those things get stirred up and I can lose access to the depths of this being,
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_00: which is so powerful beyond measure, beyond conceptual reality.
[0:24:37] SPEAKER_00: And I mean, all of us, right?
[0:24:39] SPEAKER_00: So what I like is this idea of forgiveness being the liberator.
[0:24:44] SPEAKER_00: It's your liberator.
[0:24:46] SPEAKER_00: And because energy is real, even if you only say it inside your mind, it is the liberator
[0:24:54] SPEAKER_00: of the other.
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_00: And it allows them, it invites them one step closer to their own light and one step closer
[0:25:03] Unknown: to dropping the patterns of behavior that are leading to suffering for themselves, for you,
[0:25:09] SPEAKER_00: and for others.
[0:25:11] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:25:11] SPEAKER_01: And this is starting to expose the really important shadow side of forgiveness,
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_01: which is codependency.
[0:25:18] SPEAKER_01: So I know that we're not supposed to make all or nothing rules on the spiritual path,
[0:25:24] SPEAKER_01: but I have one.
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_01: Are you ready?
[0:25:27] SPEAKER_01: Ready.
[0:25:28] SPEAKER_01: Never tolerate abuse.
[0:25:34] SPEAKER_01: Never is abuse.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: Okay.
[0:25:37] SPEAKER_01: So sometimes people can use forgiveness practice as a way to,
[0:25:42] SPEAKER_01: particularly our, we very sensitive, empathic souls,
[0:25:50] SPEAKER_01: we can be very codependently wired.
[0:25:51] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, oh, I can, basically I can stay here and take it because I can forgive,
[0:25:59] SPEAKER_01: you know, and because I'm trying to free them, right?
[0:26:01] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm trying to free their darkness and their heaviness by just being here in the
[0:26:06] Unknown: abuse with them, tolerating it and transmuting it because every time they hurl abuse at me,
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_01: I transform it.
[0:26:17] Unknown: I would say never tolerate abuse.
[0:26:21] SPEAKER_01: So get yourself safe.
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_01: Get yourself out of any abusive situation, a boss, a family member, a partner,
[0:26:30] SPEAKER_01: and you can absolutely forgive them.
[0:26:32] SPEAKER_01: You can forgive yourself for whatever circumstances allowed you to believe that
[0:26:35] SPEAKER_01: that's what you deserved in whatever kind of relationship it was.
[0:26:39] Unknown: And you can wish them all kinds of, you know, heart opening and healing,
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_01: and you can forgive them for everything.
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_01: So you can offer all those things to them, but from a distance, you know, not within the context.
[0:26:55] SPEAKER_01: What did Matt say?
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_01: He had this great quote once that was like,
[0:27:01] SPEAKER_01: your heart is not an orphanage.
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_01: And he was also talking at some point about like, we don't need to just be as empaths,
[0:27:08] Unknown: as spiritually sensitive beings, the cosmic janitors, you know, mopping up the darkness
[0:27:14] SPEAKER_01: because we have the capacity to do that.
[0:27:16] SPEAKER_01: And because we think about these things like maybe we could anchor the light, you know,
[0:27:20] SPEAKER_01: maybe we could go live in the light and not have to mop up the darkness.
[0:27:24] SPEAKER_01: We can forgive the cause of the darkness, but we don't make it.
[0:27:30] Unknown: We don't make our hearts an orphanage.
[0:27:34] Unknown: So that's my always true rule, in my opinion.
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, you can.
[0:27:45] SPEAKER_00: I know the right word cannot possibly be deal with the darkness, but you can
[0:27:49] SPEAKER_00: mop up the darkness energetically through breathing practices.
[0:27:53] Unknown: You do not have to stay in relationship to abuse or to something dark.
[0:28:01] SPEAKER_00: I know I always go back to Ram Dass's teacher Maharaj Ji saying,
[0:28:08] SPEAKER_00: you can kick them out of your life, just don't kick them out of your heart.
[0:28:11] SPEAKER_01: So you can pray for people, right?
[0:28:13] SPEAKER_00: You can pray for people.
[0:28:14] SPEAKER_00: You can find forgiveness practice.
[0:28:16] SPEAKER_00: You can hope that they will see the light of their nature.
[0:28:21] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[0:28:21] SPEAKER_01: And have faith in them living their own divine human life in whatever way it
[0:28:24] SPEAKER_01: unfolds, you know, that you're not in control of that, you know, that you can
[0:28:28] SPEAKER_01: control them into goodness.
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_01: And I mean, ultimately, if we uncover it and really look, there is like this
[0:28:33] SPEAKER_01: selfish desire, right, that I'll get what I want, that I'll get the partnership
[0:28:36] SPEAKER_01: with this friend, boss, partner, family member that I want, you know, where they
[0:28:41] SPEAKER_01: magically transform into, you know, you kiss the frog and yay, prince, you know.
[0:28:47] SPEAKER_01: But we have to kind of let go of that fairy tale and just let them live their
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_01: own divine life and have faith that they can.
[0:28:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Or we can be stuck in shame that we don't deserve more than that.
[0:28:58] SPEAKER_00: And all of this, I mean, that's where some of the self forgiveness practices
[0:29:03] SPEAKER_00: can come in, right?
[0:29:05] SPEAKER_00: Because we can be so laden with this sense of I am bad, I am wrong.
[0:29:12] SPEAKER_00: And most of us, if we had to defend that in court, all the ways we are bad,
[0:29:18] SPEAKER_00: probably have a laundry list of.
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_00: We could do a pretty good job.
[0:29:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Five to 50 moments, you know, that we could bring in at any given time,
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_00: right off the top of our head of all the different ways that we're bad.
[0:29:32] Unknown: And this practice of forgiveness starts to lighten your load.
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_00: It starts to bring this sense of relief.
[0:29:42] SPEAKER_00: Can you forgive your humanity?
[0:29:44] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I think this all begins and ends with the expectations we have for ourselves and others.
[0:29:50] SPEAKER_00: So if we expect perfect behavior, quote unquote, if we expect ourselves never to be angry,
[0:29:57] SPEAKER_00: if we expect ourselves never to make a mistake, if we expect ourselves
[0:30:03] SPEAKER_00: to make everyone happy, if we expect ourselves to never disappoint another human,
[0:30:10] Unknown: then we will find reason to be dismayed with who we are upset.
[0:30:19] SPEAKER_00: And then we will try to allow that darkness to motivate us to be a brighter light.
[0:30:25] SPEAKER_00: I will keep reminding you of all of the ways you have gone awry.
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_00: You have been horrible.
[0:30:31] SPEAKER_00: And in doing so, you will eventually become good, good enough to then deserve the light.
[0:30:39] SPEAKER_00: And this whole line of thinking, which is only born of our ego survival mechanism,
[0:30:45] Unknown: it only exists there, is hell.
[0:30:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is hell on earth.
[0:30:53] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:30:53] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I get it.
[0:30:54] SPEAKER_00: There are bigger versions of hell.
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_00: I get it.
[0:30:57] SPEAKER_00: But when you recognize that you are creating your own torment, that is its own unique kind of hell.
[0:31:05] SPEAKER_00: Because you're not even free in your own mind.
[0:31:10] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's one thing to not be able to control your external circumstances,
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_00: which can be its own unique kind of hell.
[0:31:16] SPEAKER_00: But when you recognize you cannot even come close to yourself,
[0:31:21] SPEAKER_00: you cannot even find shelter in your own heart, that is its own unique kind of hell.
[0:31:28] SPEAKER_00: And if you can expand sort of like what game are you playing?
[0:31:32] SPEAKER_00: Are you playing the game where you have to be perfect and never like upset a single human?
[0:31:38] SPEAKER_00: Because if so, you're going to have a very hard time forgiving yourself.
[0:31:41] SPEAKER_00: But if you're playing the game where you want to recognize humanity for what it is,
[0:31:46] SPEAKER_00: and the preciousness and sacredness of this beautiful journey,
[0:31:51] SPEAKER_00: then you forgive yourself the same way as you'd forgive anyone.
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_00: There's no separation.
[0:31:57] Unknown: I think what I like about this forgiveness practice,
[0:32:01] SPEAKER_00: just to give some context for how Matt began to share it,
[0:32:05] SPEAKER_00: is I guess he was exploring the concept of forgiveness.
[0:32:08] SPEAKER_00: And one day he started walking around town and in his own mind,
[0:32:13] SPEAKER_00: looking at people and saying, I forgive you.
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_00: Now, this wasn't an elitist stance, as in Matt's better than people.
[0:32:20] SPEAKER_01: Right. I'm anointing you as right now, go to God.
[0:32:25] SPEAKER_00: I am God and I have now granted you freedom.
[0:32:29] SPEAKER_00: It's not like that.
[0:32:31] SPEAKER_00: It was this beautiful place of recognizing every single one of us is in pain.
[0:32:37] SPEAKER_00: And most of us are withholding forgiveness from ourselves.
[0:32:41] SPEAKER_00: And if someone can just wish for us mercy, love, forgiveness,
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_00: by all means, coming at coming your way, be the light that you are, you're free,
[0:32:55] SPEAKER_00: that energetically it opens something both in the person wishing forgiveness
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_00: and in the person who doesn't even know it's coming their way,
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_00: but just may feel something different.
[0:33:07] SPEAKER_00: Right. So he's walking around and he's doing this.
[0:33:10] Unknown: And what I appreciated about it when I work with clients and in that moment with Matt,
[0:33:17] Unknown: and you're finding forgiveness for the other and then forgiveness for yourself.
[0:33:21] Unknown: Right. For example, maybe forgiveness for
[0:33:26] Unknown: someone yelling at you all of the time and then forgiveness for yourself
[0:33:31] Unknown: that you've held on to that for so long that you've then started to yell at yourself
[0:33:36] SPEAKER_00: and abuse yourself that you started to have self-esteem issues that ran you down a bad path.
[0:33:42] SPEAKER_00: Right. So as you do that, this whole practice to me is a oneness practice.
[0:33:49] SPEAKER_00: It is recognizing we are one in the same.
[0:33:52] SPEAKER_00: And so whether I begin with trying to find forgiveness for others in the world,
[0:33:58] SPEAKER_00: starting with easy people, people I don't know, a stranger on the street like, I love you,
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_01: I forgive you, may you be happy, may you be free, mercy to you, I don't know you.
[0:34:09] SPEAKER_00: And then you go to harder and harder people, right? Like leading all the way up to your
[0:34:14] Unknown: parent if you're mad at them. Or whether you start with yourself, a practice at home of turning
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_00: towards yourself with kindness and saying, I forgive you for not knowing better.
[0:34:25] Unknown: Either way, it's all coming back to each other. Right. The same way as compassion does. It goes
[0:34:32] SPEAKER_00: to the same place in the brain. There's no separation between compassion for another and
[0:34:37] Unknown: compassion for the self on a neurobiological level. So whatever gateway we can start to work with this
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_00: energy of light and release and recognizing humanity and making space,
[0:34:50] Unknown: the more light everything becomes. Yeah, the word mercy is helpful too. I have found that helpful
[0:34:56] SPEAKER_01: in coming back from the weekend with Matt, you know, that really lovely oneness practice that
[0:35:01] SPEAKER_01: I can just be at the grocery store. And again, it's not this superior, I have the power to whatever.
[0:35:09] SPEAKER_01: It's just this very sweet, like some random person, all is forgiven. Because we know that
[0:35:13] SPEAKER_01: we all have shame wounds and, you know, mercy to you, mercy to all of us. It's really, really nice.
[0:35:21] Unknown: It really changes the quality of my day. Yes. Mercy to the humans. Mercy to the humans. And
[0:35:32] SPEAKER_01: ho'oponopono, because you touched on that in the beginning, that's something we did.
[0:35:35] SPEAKER_01: It's a Hawaiian forgiveness practice, but Kieran Trace, who we've worked with,
[0:35:42] Unknown: had kind of adapted it in her own way. And it's really beautiful to do that towards the self,
[0:35:52] SPEAKER_01: like your present self, doing it to the past self, if there's something that happened in the past
[0:35:57] SPEAKER_01: that you can't forgive yourself for. And just to imagine these different parts of yourself talking
[0:36:02] Unknown: to each other. Or if it's not you having difficulty forgiving yourself,
[0:36:10] SPEAKER_01: one of the things that I think we both found really touching was
[0:36:14] SPEAKER_01: God saying it to you in the past and you saying it to God. So ho'oponopono is saying these phrases,
[0:36:21] SPEAKER_01: I am so sorry. Please forgive me. I love you. Thank you. And you go through this ritual where
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_01: you're repetitively saying this. So this is how we did it with Kieran Trace.
[0:36:35] SPEAKER_01: So if you can imagine something really awful happens to you in the past where you felt
[0:36:40] SPEAKER_01: abandoned by God. And I think a lot of us have those experiences, like where the fuck were you
[0:36:45] SPEAKER_00: when that all went down? Consciously or unconsciously? Exactly. And I think particularly,
[0:36:49] SPEAKER_01: like if, I mean, I was going to say our child minds especially can do this, but I think this
[0:36:54] Unknown: happens at any age. So I rescind that. Can you imagine a very tender God just saying to you,
[0:37:01] SPEAKER_01: like, I am so sorry. Not because God messed up, right? But just because God has tenderness. And
[0:37:09] SPEAKER_01: God, I don't mean the guy with the white beard and the clouds passing judgment. Like we can just talk
[0:37:14] SPEAKER_01: about the fabric of all things, right? Like the energetic fabric of all things saying to you,
[0:37:19] SPEAKER_01: you know, please forgive me. I love you. And thank you. Like thank you for whatever you lived
[0:37:24] SPEAKER_01: through and whatever that brought through for your life and for humanity. You know, and you can go
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_01: back and say to yourself, like, I am so sorry, younger self, that you had to experience that.
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_01: Please forgive me. Not because I future you, screwed up. But like just this, please forgive
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_01: me. Just this kind of on your knees, washing the feet with your hair, kind of anointing with oils,
[0:37:49] Unknown: very sweet, tender movement towards the self. I love you. And thank you. You know, thank you
[0:37:56] Unknown: for being the human who lived through that. It can be really powerful to go through that. And
[0:38:04] SPEAKER_01: I spent some time this summer on emptiness bed rest, where I would block off days at a time and
[0:38:13] Unknown: just be home doing ho'oponopono, you know, to myself and others and just going through that.
[0:38:19] Unknown: And because it does like it, you really feel how tangibly it lightens the load. You feel literally
[0:38:27] Unknown: lighter in your body and in your emotional being.
[0:38:32] Unknown: Yeah, this is one of those places where I should probably say this every episode. It's like,
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_00: don't take our word for it. Yeah, totally. Exactly. Never take our word for it.
[0:38:42] SPEAKER_00: Most of what we're talking about will only make sense when you have the experience of it, because
[0:38:48] SPEAKER_00: what we're fumbling to do is articulate experiences we're having. So when I did that practice,
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_00: ho'oponopono with Kieran, which is not the first time I've done it, I actually,
[0:39:02] Unknown: ho'oponopono is the basis of Hawaiian shamanism. And I had met a ho'oponopono practitioner years
[0:39:09] Unknown: back. I had even taught a workshop on it, on ho'oponopono. And I have many stories about it
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_00: that maybe will be appropriate to share. But when I did the class with Kieran, which is her
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_00: accelerated healing class, some of you listening are in it right now. So shout out to you. Good
[0:39:28] Unknown: luck. Blessings. It goes quick. It's accelerated for a reason. When I did it and God asked for
[0:39:41] SPEAKER_00: forgiveness and I asked for forgiveness from God, because those were the two added movements that
[0:39:46] SPEAKER_00: were unfamiliar to me. I had zero idea. First of all, I usually don't use the word God. I use it
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_00: more now. And I've explained it in earlier episodes on the show that even though I don't believe
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_00: there's a being, a personified being that the word God usually represents, I like the word because
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_00: it does stir a heart energy. It stirs an energy of devotion that sometimes just saying cosmos or life
[0:40:14] Unknown: or universe doesn't evoke in me. So I had no idea I was needing like God to acknowledge me.
[0:40:24] SPEAKER_00: Like I had no idea. There was nothing conscious about it. I was not, I was spiritual, but not
[0:40:29] SPEAKER_00: religious. I never had a divide or a sense. So I'm going through this practice, seeing some moment
[0:40:36] SPEAKER_00: in my childhood, apologizing to the child and all of this. And then here comes this
[0:40:43] Unknown: imaginal moment where God's apologizing to me and I burst out crying the same way I did when I shared
[0:40:52] SPEAKER_00: a couple of weeks ago that I burst out crying when Matt forgave my family. Like it was unexpected
[0:40:59] SPEAKER_00: and it is preverbal and it is possibly not even rational. And that's why if you're listening,
[0:41:07] Unknown: you have to just go and try these things to get a sense of, does it take you closer to love?
[0:41:16] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I think ultimately when we're looking at spiritual teachings,
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_00: they can be, there can be so many of them and some of them are really pure and some of them are
[0:41:27] SPEAKER_00: a little bit contaminated by someone's own beliefs or fears and you're trying to sort
[0:41:32] SPEAKER_00: through them. The way I look at it is, does it bring me closer to shame and contraction
[0:41:38] Unknown: or closer to love and openness and peace? And if it brings me closer to love and openness and peace,
[0:41:46] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to hang out with this little while and I'm going to keep practicing and feeling into it.
[0:41:51] SPEAKER_00: If it brings me closer to shame and contraction, something's gone awry.
[0:41:55] SPEAKER_00: Either I'm misinterpreting, I'm seeing it through a lens or a pain body or the teaching doesn't have
[0:42:00] SPEAKER_00: the purity that it needs to have. It's not transmitting it quite right. So these practices
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_00: bring you closer to love. And I remember, and I think I might've told this story once on the show,
[0:42:15] Unknown: but I'm just going to tell it again. I remember when I first met this Ho'oponopono practitioner,
[0:42:21] SPEAKER_00: who's a friend of mine, I had actually interviewed her. I had a show a long time ago called Map to
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_00: Self. I forgot about that. Remember? I interviewed Brooke on that too. I think it was a vlog back in
[0:42:34] Unknown: the vlogging days. And I interviewed this woman and this woman had grown up with an alcoholic father
[0:42:45] Unknown: and kind of the painfully typical stories like him taking her to bars and then forgetting her
[0:42:53] SPEAKER_00: out in the car and like leaving her all night while he got drunk and then having affairs and
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_00: you know, just the really awful things that can occur when addiction is in a family.
[0:43:05] SPEAKER_00: So she's telling me the story of her father and I know that what we're talking about is forgiveness.
[0:43:10] SPEAKER_00: So mentally preparing for her to share the story of how she found the ability to forgive her father,
[0:43:17] SPEAKER_00: which for many of us is a big moment, right? It's a big moment when it feels
[0:43:22] Unknown: genuine that we can forgive someone. And instead, what she shared with me was how she went to him
[0:43:32] SPEAKER_00: and did Ho'oponopono and asked him for forgiveness. So she approached him with,
[0:43:39] Unknown: I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I love you. Thank you. And I was like,
[0:43:46] Unknown: what? Why are you asking him for forgiveness? You know, he's the shitty one, right? Here I am,
[0:43:53] Unknown: judge and jury, right? He's the bad one. And what she described was
[0:43:59] Unknown: that ever since he had done all the things he had done, she had been withholding from him,
[0:44:09] Unknown: judging him, separating from him, not seeing him as sacred or divine, or even really quite frankly,
[0:44:17] Unknown: seeing his humanity. I'm putting words in her mouth now. And she apologized for that, for not
[0:44:26] Unknown: being able to recognize that he was stuck, right? He was stuck in his own pain and his own devices
[0:44:36] Unknown: and to find mercy, right? To find the wish for mercy. And she apologized to him with this
[0:44:44] SPEAKER_00: practice. And you know, it completely changed him, which was not her intention.
[0:44:51] SPEAKER_01: It can't be for a genuine forgiveness practice, but
[0:44:54] Unknown: can't be. But sometimes alchemy is powerful. And she does that. And he winds up this totally
[0:45:05] SPEAKER_00: non-spiritual guy studying Ho'oponopono, like going to her workshops, like really, really,
[0:45:13] Unknown: it invited the light back in. And he was able to connect with his own seed of light.
[0:45:19] Unknown: And I think that that is really powerful for a lot of reasons. It takes us out of the victim
[0:45:29] Unknown: seed. It gives us back our power by allowing us to be the liberator, right? To say, I don't have
[0:45:37] SPEAKER_00: to pretend that I am still the young girl who is under your influence anymore. I don't have to hold
[0:45:44] SPEAKER_00: on to that identity. I don't have to hold on to that role. I don't have to hold on to the darkness
[0:45:51] Unknown: to motivate me not to be like you. I don't have to hold on to my judgment to make me safe from
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: loving you because I'm afraid to love you. So I must judge you. I don't have to do any of that
[0:46:02] Unknown: because I am light, right? I am one. I am universe. I am cosmos. And I'm just, her name was Jade,
[0:46:11] SPEAKER_00: and I'm just Vanessa, but I don't need all of that anymore. So in that movement, she got to say,
[0:46:18] Unknown: I just get to be me today, the light, and I am sorry. And I just thought that was so, so,
[0:46:27] SPEAKER_00: so inspiring to me. And I went on and there's a moment I've described before where,
[0:46:34] SPEAKER_00: oh, I had done something to my ex boyfriend. I was just flirting with someone at the end of
[0:46:38] SPEAKER_00: our relationship. I didn't cheat on him. It was nothing like that. Nothing really crazy, but,
[0:46:43] SPEAKER_00: and we were pretty clearly ending, but nevertheless, you know, I was flirting with
[0:46:47] Unknown: someone and, and I feel like he had sensed that, right? So at one point I wrote him ho'oponopono
[0:46:57] SPEAKER_00: and a whole letter, not justifying myself, not justifying why I did it. I had a ton of good
[0:47:03] SPEAKER_00: reasons. A lot of things he did a lot of things in my past, you know, that would justify it.
[0:47:08] SPEAKER_00: I didn't do any of that. I just said like, you know what, I'm sorry, because you're,
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_00: you're this wonderful person and you certainly deserve more than that, no matter what.
[0:47:17] SPEAKER_00: And I deserve to do differently than that. I want to do differently than that. And I do my light.
[0:47:22] Unknown: And what happened was, um, some people will think that it's like their ego pride can't
[0:47:29] SPEAKER_00: stand that. To me, it was like exactly the opposite. It was such a relief. It was such a relief
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_00: to just own that, like, like an honoring of my own humanity. Like, yeah, I get to be imperfect.
[0:47:42] Unknown: I can admit it, right? And I can just simply say, I'm sorry and do it with such a pure and sincere
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_00: heart. And he felt gobs of relief. He said he felt better than he had in months, because we
[0:47:56] Unknown: had broken up like six months before when I did it. Um, and I just think, you know, that's,
[0:48:03] SPEAKER_00: that's the power of these practices. Yeah. And both of the stories that you shared really,
[0:48:08] SPEAKER_01: really illustrate like what you were saying, you know, does it take you towards contraction and
[0:48:13] Unknown: shame or does it take you towards opening and softening? And sometimes we can tell a story that
[0:48:19] SPEAKER_01: opening and softening is just this opiate, like as a way to ignore suffering, move away from suffering
[0:48:25] Unknown: and do the happy fake spiritual person thing. But the reality is exactly what you're describing.
[0:48:31] SPEAKER_01: When these things come through with sincerity, you move towards suffering with a very, very healing
[0:48:40] SPEAKER_01: capacity, you know, as opposed to, oh, thank you, I'll just take my opiate and go zone out in the
[0:48:46] SPEAKER_01: corner now, you know, you actually start to transmute these things because you become the
[0:48:51] Unknown: light, right? Like you're able to actually, um, heal these patterns in yourself and in others.
[0:48:57] SPEAKER_01: And I just want to underscore that because I think sometimes we can tell the story of like,
[0:49:02] SPEAKER_01: that it's dangerous to move towards what feels like softening, opening love, because we will
[0:49:08] SPEAKER_01: abandon the suffering of humanity when reality, it gives us the openness and the willingness and
[0:49:14] Unknown: the capacity to move towards. Mm hmm. That's funny. I just went through this with a friend of mine and
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_00: you know, we sort of did an exercise, she was worried about that, that not to suffer with,
[0:49:26] SPEAKER_00: you know, if you don't suffer with, you'll sort of take your eye off of the ball and
[0:49:30] SPEAKER_00: you'll go into la la land and you'll abandon people and their suffering.
[0:49:35] SPEAKER_00: And when we did an exercise and she really reached like a Samadhi state and then thought
[0:49:41] Unknown: about someone who was suffering, there was zero abandonment. It just wasn't drowning with them.
[0:49:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, right. It just wasn't, and I don't mean that in a, in a judgmental way, it just was like,
[0:49:54] SPEAKER_00: if someone's really caught in fear and anxiety and pain, if I literally match you, we're both there.
[0:50:03] SPEAKER_00: And that's actually not so helpful. So the person was able to be in empathy, like I feel you, I feel
[0:50:11] Unknown: for you, I feel what's happening, I recognize you, but not get lost in the emotion themselves.
[0:50:19] Unknown: So it's not an abandonment. And what I've been noticing since I've, we'll see how long it lasts,
[0:50:25] Unknown: but since I've dropped shame is it only gives me more energy. Yeah. To show up for people.
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_00: There's no lack of motivation. I didn't need to judge myself into being present and loving.
[0:50:41] SPEAKER_00: Right. In fact, it didn't help at all. It did quite the opposite.
[0:50:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So get shut down and scared and you can't move towards. I mean, if you think about giving
[0:50:49] SPEAKER_01: birth, you don't want a midwife that's like, I know it's terrible. Oh, it doesn't, it hurts so
[0:50:56] SPEAKER_01: much. You know, you want the midwife that can be like, babe, I know you're amazing. You got this.
[0:51:02] Unknown: It's awful. I'm here. You can do this. You want the psychologist to do the same thing.
[0:51:06] SPEAKER_00: Totally. I mean, if you're talking to a therapist who got lost in your emotion and you're both
[0:51:11] SPEAKER_00: sitting there like crying at the very same level. Not helpful. Super not helpful. I mean, whenever
[0:51:19] SPEAKER_00: I get to these kind of gunky moments, you know, when you worry that to find spaces of forgiveness
[0:51:26] Unknown: and compassion and love would mean to turn your back on engaging, you know, engaging at the right
[0:51:33] SPEAKER_00: level. I just go to, I go to people I admire. I think about people like Nelson Mandela.
[0:51:42] SPEAKER_00: And I think about, you know, Nelson Mandela at first, he was pretty much engaged in quite
[0:51:48] SPEAKER_00: intense action. I mean, he was engaged in violence and everything like that. But,
[0:51:52] SPEAKER_00: you know, where he landed once he got into a position of power is really, we have to forgive
[0:51:57] SPEAKER_00: these people. We have to, because if we go into a cycle, the cycle never ends. And the Dalai Lama
[0:52:06] Unknown: is in the same exact position. You know, if we go into a cycle, you know, where violence begets
[0:52:12] SPEAKER_00: violence and anger begets anger and shame begets shame, there's no way out. And what we want first
[0:52:20] Unknown: and foremost is a loving world, a world where this doesn't happen anymore. Right. And so I don't think
[0:52:31] Unknown: that forgiveness creates passivity. I think it brings in the most centered, peaceful level of
[0:52:40] SPEAKER_00: clarity, because we're no longer being clouded by the fears and the pain bodies and the judgments
[0:52:52] Unknown: that were inhabit, like in inhibiting our vision.
[0:52:59] SPEAKER_01: Amen to that.
