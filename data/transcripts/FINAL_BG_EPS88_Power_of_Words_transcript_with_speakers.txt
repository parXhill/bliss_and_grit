[0:00:24] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls.
[0:00:31] SPEAKER_00: You are listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:32] SPEAKER_00: I'm Brooke Thomas, and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:37] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we are talking about being on the embodied spiritual path.
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_00: And what does that actually mean?
[0:00:43] SPEAKER_00: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_00: All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that there's
[0:00:52] Unknown: a human life.
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_00: And today we're talking about the power of words, so how we are shaped by the words that
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_00: we hear and how we shape our worlds with the words that we use.
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: But in particular, we're really dialing into how we shape people's view of who we are
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_00: with the words that we can usually, typically, unconsciously use about ourselves.
[0:01:17] Unknown: Now, commonly, when people head into this kind of conversation, this kind of territory,
[0:01:23] SPEAKER_00: there are teachings that crop up, particularly in popular culture, about how we need to edit
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_00: and suppress ourselves or pretend to be something other than what we feel.
[0:01:33] SPEAKER_00: So a lot of what we're doing here is exploring shame, blame, and superstition-free inquiries
[0:01:39] SPEAKER_00: around how we can shift the words that we use to describe ourselves and the world we
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_00: live in and therefore create different kinds of relationships and experiences and just
[0:01:50] SPEAKER_00: views of what's going on here.
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, we would of course be thrilled if you left a review on iTunes

[0:02:26] Unknown: So it's exciting.
[0:02:28] SPEAKER_00: One last thing before we head into the conversation.
[0:02:31] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes we swear, so if you're in company where you don't want swears to be a fly in,
[0:02:36] SPEAKER_00: you can wear headphones.
[0:02:37] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:40] SPEAKER_00: Hello Brooke.
[0:02:42] Unknown: Hey Vanessa.
[0:02:44] SPEAKER_00: So one topic that's been on my mind a lot lately, besides the nervous system, I was
[0:02:51] Unknown: obsessed.
[0:02:52] SPEAKER_00: Yes, we're both obsessed.
[0:02:55] Unknown: The other thing obsessed with is the power of words.
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_00: And I'll say what I mean, because I think a lot of people talk about the power of words
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_00: And I'm not actually always in agreement with what some of the teachings are on it.
[0:03:12] SPEAKER_00: So we have a whole 45 to 50 minutes to be very clear about what we do mean.
[0:03:20] SPEAKER_00: So let me just dive in.
[0:03:23] Unknown: Okay, so if you all heard the Matt Conner interview, and Brooke, you did, you were there,
[0:03:29] SPEAKER_00: we were talking about words, right?
[0:03:32] SPEAKER_00: Because when I had gone on retreat with Matt in April in Portland, he was teaching about
[0:03:41] SPEAKER_00: words.
[0:03:42] SPEAKER_00: He was really doing a beautiful deconstruction meditation to help you start to release your
[0:03:47] SPEAKER_00: grip onto concepts and beliefs.
[0:03:49] Unknown: And so the way that he started it was by pointing to how people's words essentially shaped your
[0:03:57] SPEAKER_00: entire experience of reality.
[0:04:00] SPEAKER_00: In the example he gave at that moment, even the word enlightenment, he was saying, like,
[0:04:05] SPEAKER_00: you think it's supposed to look a certain way or be a certain way, like someone taught
[0:04:09] Unknown: you what that word is.
[0:04:12] SPEAKER_00: And he was talking about, of course, like, people teach you through their actions, through
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_00: the words they use, through the words they don't use, how to see yourself, what to value,
[0:04:23] Unknown: what to prioritize, what to put your attention on, how to imagine love, what to expect, what
[0:04:30] SPEAKER_00: a good life looks like, what a safe life looks like, and so forth.
[0:04:34] SPEAKER_00: And I thought that was really powerful.
[0:04:37] SPEAKER_00: I don't know why.
[0:04:38] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's not that this isn't something we all could have understood at some point.
[0:04:43] SPEAKER_00: They understand what conditioning is.
[0:04:44] SPEAKER_00: But, you know, like, right moment, right time, right medicine, and something just explodes
[0:04:50] SPEAKER_00: in you.
[0:04:51] Unknown: And I got really clear, like, wow, okay.
[0:04:56] Unknown: So all it would have taken, for example, for me to get a complex when, where I thought
[0:05:04] SPEAKER_00: I was a weirdo, that's one of my complexes, y'all, if you've been listening, you know
[0:05:08] SPEAKER_00: it, right?
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_00: It's not really there anymore.
[0:05:10] SPEAKER_00: Just an update.
[0:05:11] SPEAKER_00: It hangs around the fringes.
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: So that was like a lifelong one, right?
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm a weirdo.
[0:05:17] SPEAKER_00: I'm a misfit.
[0:05:18] SPEAKER_00: So all it would have taken was me to come home one day from school, tell my mom that
[0:05:24] SPEAKER_00: was picking on me.
[0:05:26] SPEAKER_00: And for her to have in innocence chosen the words, wow, it must feel so hard not to fit
[0:05:32] Unknown: in.
[0:05:33] SPEAKER_00: And your innocent mind's like, wait, what?
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_00: I don't fit in.
[0:05:36] Unknown: Oh, God, newsflash.
[0:05:37] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's how I'm supposed to interpret this thing.
[0:05:42] Unknown: Where this little girl picked on me.
[0:05:45] Unknown: What?
[0:05:46] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:05:47] SPEAKER_00: And it's so innocent.
[0:05:48] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, no one is to blame.
[0:05:51] SPEAKER_00: But that's a trip, isn't it?
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_00: If you slow that down and you realize that your parents conditioning, your siblings conditioning,
[0:06:00] Unknown: their parents conditioning, that all of these things are influencing how they'll choose
[0:06:06] SPEAKER_00: their words in any given moment to speak to you about a circumstance that is arising and
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_00: thereby they'll give you meaning.
[0:06:15] Unknown: They'll shape the meaning you take out of any given circumstance.
[0:06:20] SPEAKER_00: It kind of blows the mind, right?
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_00: Especially since most of us don't have to go back very far in our lineage to experience
[0:06:30] Unknown: real trauma, right?
[0:06:32] SPEAKER_00: Either you yourself experienced it in real time or, I mean, you don't have to go very,
[0:06:37] SPEAKER_00: very far back one or two generations and you'll see, you know, people coming over on boats
[0:06:43] Unknown: and the whole of abode and slavery and all sorts of traumas.
[0:06:47] Unknown: So that got me thinking about the power of the word, which moved into me reflecting on
[0:06:55] Unknown: the power of the words we use in terms of shaping other people's realities, but specifically
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_00: in terms of shaping people's experience of us.
[0:07:11] Unknown: Want to take it from there?
[0:07:13] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[0:07:14] SPEAKER_00: I don't know what I'm going to say, but I'm going to take it from there.
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[0:07:22] SPEAKER_00: So there are a couple of ways that my mind goes with that.
[0:07:25] Unknown: One is something that I'm noticing in myself lately and the other is just knowing the tendency.
[0:07:34] Unknown: So we can have all of these unconscious, this is the tendency, unconscious tendencies to
[0:07:41] Unknown: view ourselves a certain way.
[0:07:44] SPEAKER_00: And by unconscious, I mean literally we're not conscious of the ways that we view ourselves.
[0:07:50] Unknown: And so those can often be identities around, you gave the weird one example or the burdensome
[0:08:02] SPEAKER_00: one, the one who never gets a lucky break, you know, all these kinds of things are ways
[0:08:08] SPEAKER_00: that we, I think Lock Kelly was calling them sub-personalities.
[0:08:12] SPEAKER_00: We've had teachers, you know, Kieran, Trace and Cartoli who call them pain bodies.
[0:08:18] Unknown: So those things can run through our systems enough that we use words that keep demonstrating
[0:08:26] SPEAKER_00: them to other people.
[0:08:28] SPEAKER_00: So we can always, like something that's so simple, but I'm noticing when I write emails
[0:08:38] Unknown: or texts, which these days all of us do plenty, how it's so great because it's written down.
[0:08:44] SPEAKER_00: So it slows me down and I can have some witness on it.
[0:08:48] SPEAKER_00: I'm so fucking apologetic.
[0:08:50] Unknown: Always.
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_00: Over nothing.
[0:08:53] SPEAKER_00: Over my existence, right?
[0:08:55] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry, but I meant to write you back yesterday, but, or just, that's the word too.
[0:09:03] SPEAKER_00: I'm just getting in touch to confirm that we have a meeting tomorrow.
[0:09:07] SPEAKER_00: Just that word.
[0:09:08] SPEAKER_00: Just.
[0:09:09] SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
[0:09:10] SPEAKER_00: Like everything has this kind of like this sort of curtsy and lowering head.
[0:09:16] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry that I'm taking up any space.
[0:09:19] SPEAKER_00: And it's really fascinating.
[0:09:21] SPEAKER_00: Like that's something I've been watching in myself, that tendency.
[0:09:24] Unknown: And that's just languaging that before I had any awareness of it, it was the polite thing
[0:09:30] SPEAKER_00: to do, it was the right thing to do, or it was just what I was doing without any awareness
[0:09:35] Unknown: at all.
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_00: And then I've also been noticing lately, because I'm at this stage right now where there's
[0:09:42] SPEAKER_00: certain patterns that I've had my entire life that are continuing.
[0:09:48] SPEAKER_00: But on it, they're continuing in a much, much lighter way.
[0:09:51] SPEAKER_00: And I have awareness.
[0:09:52] SPEAKER_00: So we talked about this, I think, in the Locke and Matt similarities between teachings episode,
[0:09:58] SPEAKER_00: where it's like there's this taking a tour.
[0:10:01] SPEAKER_00: It's like now, instead of being in the thing, you're like driving a tour bus through the
[0:10:07] SPEAKER_00: thing and you're like, oh, I see out the window that and I see that.
[0:10:11] SPEAKER_00: I think of it like an it's a small world, right?
[0:10:15] SPEAKER_00: You used to be one of the animatronics.
[0:10:20] SPEAKER_00: And now you're in the little boat watching the animatronics.
[0:10:23] Unknown: Exactly what it feels like.
[0:10:27] Unknown: So it's fascinating because it's like the thing, the small world ride hasn't changed,
[0:10:34] SPEAKER_00: although I would say the patterns are much, much lighter.
[0:10:37] SPEAKER_00: But now I'm observing them.
[0:10:38] SPEAKER_00: And so one of the other ones, besides the like, I am so apologetic for my existence
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_00: all the time, particularly when I write things down.
[0:10:45] Unknown: The other one is how frequently and quickly I go to despair stories.
[0:10:52] SPEAKER_00: And like, there is fucking plenty to despair about these days.
[0:10:56] SPEAKER_00: So it's not like I'm making shit up.
[0:10:58] SPEAKER_00: You know, like I'm usually talking about situations, political situations and human situations
[0:11:03] Unknown: out there in the world.
[0:11:05] SPEAKER_00: But it's like, wow, I really and especially I notice I'll do it if it's somebody who
[0:11:13] SPEAKER_00: I'm actually not that close to, which is kind of interesting.
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_00: So a friend, but like three layers out.
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_00: So an acquaintance, which is fascinating because what are we doing with acquaintances?
[0:11:24] SPEAKER_00: We're trying to get to know one another.
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_00: And each of us is like demonstrating I'm this kind of person with these kinds of thoughts
[0:11:32] Unknown: and opinions.
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_00: And so with somebody like you or some of my other very close to your friends, it's just
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_00: much more intimate.
[0:11:42] SPEAKER_00: It's not that I'm not talking about being upset about things in the world, but it's
[0:11:44] Unknown: fascinating how quickly I go to demonstrating despair and using words.
[0:11:53] SPEAKER_00: You know, feeling rage or despair or upset is fine, but I go into this hopelessness place.
[0:11:59] Unknown: And so what I'm watching on the small world ride is like, oh, okay, not only am I talking
[0:12:05] SPEAKER_00: about the very real things that are happening in the world that very genuinely break my
[0:12:10] Unknown: heart, but I'm also offering the gift of hopelessness.
[0:12:17] Unknown: And the way that it's about me is like, I am the hopeless one, right?
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_00: Like I am the one who sees the injustice and feels hopeless about humanity.
[0:12:33] SPEAKER_00: So those are a couple that I'm watching in myself.
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_00: And I just think that when we can get to that level, a couple of interesting things come
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_00: up because, okay, I'm observing them.
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_00: So some of the teachings that we would hear very much, let's say more in popular culture
[0:12:46] SPEAKER_00: about that are like, oh, okay, good.
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_00: Don't do that anymore.
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_00: And like I was joking with, I think I was talking with one of my clients the other day.
[0:12:55] SPEAKER_00: Maybe I've said this on the show.
[0:12:56] SPEAKER_00: I apologize for repeating myself, but there was a Saturday Night Live skit a long time
[0:13:01] SPEAKER_00: ago where Bob Newhart played a psychologist.
[0:13:04] SPEAKER_00: Did you ever see this one?
[0:13:05] SPEAKER_00: A therapist.
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_00: And so the skit was him as the therapist and he would have different clients come through
[0:13:11] SPEAKER_00: and they would say all the things you would say to a therapist, you know, I can't recover
[0:13:15] SPEAKER_00: from my broken heart or I don't know why I can't stop cheating on my wife or I have a
[0:13:19] SPEAKER_00: gambling addiction or all these things.
[0:13:22] SPEAKER_00: And the only thing he would say in response, just sitting back like glasses on his nose,
[0:13:26] SPEAKER_00: clipboard in his hand was, we'll just stop doing that.
[0:13:28] Unknown: Yeah, but I've really tried and oh my God, I mean, I drink three bottles of wine a night
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_00: and then I noticed the next day, I bet all this money on horses.
[0:13:38] SPEAKER_00: Well, you should stop it.
[0:13:40] SPEAKER_00: I really want to stop it, but stop it.
[0:13:42] Unknown: Just stop it.
[0:13:43] SPEAKER_00: Just stop doing that.
[0:13:44] SPEAKER_00: And so it would be awesome if it worked like that.
[0:13:50] SPEAKER_00: And so we treat like none of us would go to a therapist who sat across from us and only
[0:13:56] SPEAKER_00: said the phrase, we'll just stop doing that because it's insane.
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_00: It's like, obviously we know we don't want to be doing the behavior.
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_00: That's why we're in the office.
[0:14:04] SPEAKER_00: But we treat ourselves that way.
[0:14:07] Unknown: So oh, Brooke, you're demonstrating that you're the hopeless one or that you're the one who
[0:14:13] SPEAKER_00: has to apologize for her existence.
[0:14:15] Unknown: Just stop it.
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_00: Turn that front upside down or put on a new persona, like a more bold, more courageous,
[0:14:23] SPEAKER_00: more optimistic one.
[0:14:25] SPEAKER_00: But it just doesn't quite work.
[0:14:28] Unknown: And so then we just wind up creating like a harder shell around the pattern because
[0:14:35] SPEAKER_00: we're just shellacking it and we're layering it with some new thing.
[0:14:40] SPEAKER_00: So I feel like it would be interesting to explore like what do in something I've been
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_00: exploring internally in myself because it can be quite uncomfortable to see with a lot
[0:14:50] SPEAKER_00: of clarity.
[0:14:51] Unknown: Oh my gosh, I do that all the time.
[0:14:54] Unknown: I'm really teaching people who I am with my words and I'm really teaching them how to
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_00: treat me.
[0:15:02] SPEAKER_00: And I don't like what I'm teaching.
[0:15:06] Unknown: Oh, like if I got to pick from a menu, I wouldn't pick those ones, but I seem to keep doing
[0:15:13] SPEAKER_00: it and I can watch myself like I'm watching a movie act this out over and over and over
[0:15:18] Unknown: again.
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_00: But shame is not the answer.
[0:15:21] SPEAKER_00: Like, why did you do that again, Brooke?
[0:15:24] SPEAKER_00: What's wrong with that?
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_00: Well, that's definitely, we know, never our answer, never the one we resort to.
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_00: But it is interesting to consider.
[0:15:33] Unknown: I mean, some of what I heard and what you said or what I took from it was, okay, so
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_00: let's say when you meet these third layer out people and you're sharing the stories
[0:15:46] Unknown: of hopelessness and despair, one might imagine that somewhere along the line, you got that
[0:15:52] SPEAKER_00: that's the way that people bond.
[0:15:55] Unknown: Like that's some way that people get to know each other and they bond.
[0:16:01] SPEAKER_00: Wherever you got that picture in your life.
[0:16:05] Unknown: So it is interesting to imagine because what happens then, it's so sad that our brains
[0:16:11] SPEAKER_00: do this, but our brains put people into buckets and categories.
[0:16:14] SPEAKER_00: So then the person goes, oh, great.
[0:16:16] SPEAKER_00: So whenever I want to talk about this sad, despairing thing, I know who to go to.
[0:16:22] SPEAKER_00: Brooke is really going to hear me.
[0:16:23] SPEAKER_00: She's really going to be there.
[0:16:24] SPEAKER_00: And you're like, oh, God, I also want the really good news conversations and the really
[0:16:29] Unknown: light conversations, right?
[0:16:33] Unknown: But I'm trying to think, okay, so I'm trying to think through really the question you pose.
[0:16:39] SPEAKER_00: Like, what do you do about it?
[0:16:41] SPEAKER_00: Because I feel like I have used behavioral intervention with myself.
[0:16:48] SPEAKER_00: And I'm wondering what I did.
[0:16:50] SPEAKER_00: For example, I was always the person who apologized for myself, too.
[0:16:54] Unknown: I don't know if this is a common female issue.
[0:16:58] SPEAKER_00: I think it is really common female issue.
[0:17:01] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know if it's also generational.
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm not sure if if all of you listeners in your early 20s go through this the way
[0:17:08] SPEAKER_00: that we may go through this because our parents were raised in a different generation entirely
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_00: with how they treated women.
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_00: But I know that I have a lot of clients who do it right.
[0:17:19] SPEAKER_00: Do you apologize when you're crying?
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_00: Like, oh, heaven forbid, I burdened you with my heartfelt emotions, right?
[0:17:26] SPEAKER_00: And I used to do that all the time.
[0:17:29] Unknown: You're in therapy asking for a tissue and going, I'm so sorry that you're crying, right?
[0:17:37] SPEAKER_00: Or when you're in a plane and you're sitting in the middle seat and you have to get out
[0:17:42] SPEAKER_00: to go to the bathroom and you have to ask that person to get up, oh, my God, I'm so
[0:17:46] SPEAKER_00: sorry.
[0:17:47] SPEAKER_00: Would you move?
[0:17:49] Unknown: And I remember also seeing what I spoke about and how it felt in my body.
[0:17:57] SPEAKER_00: Like did that feel true to me when I was saying it?
[0:17:59] Unknown: Did it feel like resonant?
[0:18:02] SPEAKER_00: Was I speaking from a place of depth, like connection, I should say, probably connection
[0:18:07] Unknown: to myself or was I speaking from habit?
[0:18:12] SPEAKER_00: And as I observed all of that, gosh, I feel like what I did do was experiment with doing
[0:18:18] Unknown: it differently, experiment with it.
[0:18:22] SPEAKER_00: What would happen?
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_00: I mean, obviously, most of it is unconscious, right?
[0:18:28] SPEAKER_00: Then it can start to come to our consciousness.
[0:18:30] SPEAKER_00: Like, oh, my God, I'm teaching people to see me as the insecure one, for example.
[0:18:37] SPEAKER_00: That's another one we do all the time.
[0:18:39] SPEAKER_00: Oh, what?
[0:18:40] SPEAKER_00: Me?
[0:18:41] SPEAKER_00: No, I don't feel pretty like you, right?
[0:18:42] Unknown: All of that.
[0:18:43] SPEAKER_00: And then I'm teaching people to see me that way.
[0:18:47] SPEAKER_00: But I have a million things I could say to someone, right?
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_00: A million things that are genuine to me.
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_00: So I think what I did was I started to experiment with it, like experiment with getting up on
[0:18:59] Unknown: a plane and not saying I'm so sorry and experiment with sharing a different story, like rather
[0:19:09] SPEAKER_00: than the insecure one, which was the one I was using to bond with people.
[0:19:13] Unknown: And then I would watch and see because the whole movement of that, the whole movement
[0:19:20] Unknown: of the words and how we're choosing our words unconsciously reflects the belief system,
[0:19:27] SPEAKER_00: right?
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_00: So let's just imagine, I don't know, you might know what your belief systems are.
[0:19:32] SPEAKER_00: But let's say, for example, when I get up and I apologize for making someone move, it
[0:19:38] SPEAKER_00: really is because I felt like I had to apologize for my existence.
[0:19:42] Unknown: And really, root, root, root, root, what was that?
[0:19:47] SPEAKER_00: So then of course, it might be scary not to use those words.
[0:19:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry.
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_00: Like it may be all sorts of uncomfortable.
[0:19:53] SPEAKER_00: But if you do that without using those words, and no one's upset and nothing happens that's
[0:20:00] SPEAKER_00: bad, it starts to open up new possibilities in your being.
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_00: Same thing.
[0:20:08] Unknown: I want to bond with someone, but I'm not going to use the stories of despair.
[0:20:15] SPEAKER_00: Or in my case, the way I was bonding with people is like, let me show you my belly,
[0:20:19] SPEAKER_00: let me show you how vulnerable I am.
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_00: So let me tell you I have problems too.
[0:20:24] Unknown: So then you'll feel safe with me, which isn't wrong.
[0:20:28] SPEAKER_00: It's just creating a certain perception and it may or may not be genuine in that moment
[0:20:32] SPEAKER_00: for me to create that perception.
[0:20:34] Unknown: But if I don't do it, then what happens?
[0:20:39] SPEAKER_00: Do people bond with me?
[0:20:40] SPEAKER_00: Don't they?
[0:20:41] SPEAKER_00: Does my worst fear come to pass?
[0:20:42] Unknown: Do you know what I mean about that?
[0:20:45] Unknown: Experimentation, but not...
[0:20:49] SPEAKER_00: I know that I always get hung up around behavior change because I often don't offer behavior
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_00: changes because usually enough awareness, something shifts.
[0:20:56] Unknown: Right.
[0:20:57] SPEAKER_00: But every once in a while, I do think it's useful when we play an experiment with like,
[0:21:03] SPEAKER_00: well, what would happen if I did this differently?
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:21:06] Unknown: I think super useful and what you're describing is taking those behavior experiments without
[0:21:14] Unknown: shame, also without pretending.
[0:21:20] SPEAKER_00: I've heard some people do this.
[0:21:21] Unknown: I remember a bajillion years ago, there was somebody who I knew in a classroom setting,
[0:21:26] SPEAKER_00: so not somebody who was a close friend.
[0:21:28] SPEAKER_00: But whenever something upsetting would come up or emotions, and this was when I was training
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_00: at the Rolfe Institute.
[0:21:33] SPEAKER_00: So we're training his bodywork or shit comes up all the time.
[0:21:37] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't like a history class or something where things aren't going to get intense.
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_00: We're not going to talk about things.
[0:21:43] SPEAKER_00: You go cancel clear and then smile and walk away and then like stiffen his spine and get
[0:21:51] SPEAKER_00: this kind of up above orientation with people like bigger spine, kind of almost like an
[0:21:57] SPEAKER_00: actual physical looking down on the people.
[0:22:00] Unknown: And sometimes he would actually like tidy, you know, wipe his hands and walk away.
[0:22:06] SPEAKER_00: So that's avoiding shame is like, why can't I stop or I'm the word?
[0:22:12] SPEAKER_00: What's wrong with me?
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_00: I should be farther along in my healing journey.
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_00: You know, so those things are not not useful.
[0:22:18] SPEAKER_00: And you're describing like experimenting with behavior without any of that.
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_00: So like, for example, in my texts and emails, and it's fascinating to to take these tiny
[0:22:29] SPEAKER_00: little tweaks like you're describing on the plane, just not saying I'm sorry.
[0:22:32] SPEAKER_00: You can say, excuse me and thank you, both of which are polite, neither of which apologize
[0:22:37] SPEAKER_00: for your existence.
[0:22:38] SPEAKER_00: And if I text people or or email people and I won't let myself use the word just or sorry,
[0:22:47] SPEAKER_00: it feels uncomfortable.
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but it's so great.
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_00: You know, so it's like written so I can slow down and be very conscious.
[0:22:56] SPEAKER_00: See the word.
[0:22:57] SPEAKER_00: I removed the amount of just and sorry that I'm deleting.
[0:23:02] SPEAKER_00: It's really entertaining or extra exclamation points.
[0:23:06] SPEAKER_00: And then threatening.
[0:23:09] SPEAKER_00: And friendly and very excited.
[0:23:14] SPEAKER_00: So just changing that is such a great little modification because it's tiny,
[0:23:19] SPEAKER_00: it's visible, it's obvious.
[0:23:22] Unknown: And the fact that it's uncomfortable means that something is shifting in me because I'm
[0:23:28] SPEAKER_00: pushing against patterns, not in an aggressive, self-loathing way, but just literally what
[0:23:34] SPEAKER_00: would happen if I just communicated with people without apologizing for my existence?
[0:23:40] SPEAKER_00: Probably they would just get the information I'm trying to convey without the additional
[0:23:44] SPEAKER_00: information.
[0:23:45] SPEAKER_00: Oh, P.S. I'm sorry that I exist.
[0:23:48] SPEAKER_00: And then maybe you'll interrupt the feedback loop where your own words make you think you
[0:23:55] SPEAKER_00: need to be sorry for your own existence.
[0:23:58] Unknown: Right. It's like almost like the more that is our natural flow and we're using words
[0:24:05] Unknown: and behaviors and actions to reflect this, you know, miss like mythological belief system
[0:24:14] SPEAKER_00: we have. Like I'm weird or we have to apologize for our existence.
[0:24:19] SPEAKER_00: The more we keep using words that set that into place, it's almost like we believe it.
[0:24:26] SPEAKER_00: In part because then, you know, some people can treat us such a way.
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_00: Now saying I'm so sorry is not usually the biggest deal.
[0:24:34] SPEAKER_00: Any nice person won't think much of it, but it does kind of signal people I've done
[0:24:40] Unknown: something wrong and it can get them to think it.
[0:24:43] SPEAKER_00: Like maybe you did something wrong, you know, you're always doing this and this.
[0:24:48] Unknown: And that can start like a whole cycle in effect, you know, even bigger if we're always,
[0:24:56] SPEAKER_00: let's say, only sharing the part of us that's in despair and not sharing the part of us
[0:25:00] SPEAKER_00: that's like overflowing with gratitude and joy, then people could come to see us as the
[0:25:05] SPEAKER_00: despairing one.
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: And then maybe they don't want to share with us when they're elated because they're
[0:25:11] SPEAKER_00: thinking, oh, I don't want to upset her.
[0:25:14] SPEAKER_00: You know, she's ruined her despair party.
[0:25:17] Unknown: Yes. So in the end, we're like more and more swimming in aloneness with the experience.
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_00: Right. So that's one thing that's obvious.
[0:25:28] SPEAKER_00: We did a whole episode on like self-fulfilling prophecies at one point and how like, you
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_00: know, crossing your arms makes someone maybe not want to talk to you.
[0:25:36] Unknown: And then you're like, I knew I was a loser and no one liked me.
[0:25:39] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:25:40] Unknown: But there's this other piece.
[0:25:41] SPEAKER_00: It's like a feedback loop with ourselves.
[0:25:43] SPEAKER_00: One, because then maybe no one talks to you about their elation just in this made up part
[0:25:50] SPEAKER_00: of this example.
[0:25:51] Unknown: But two, because every time we say it, it's like, you know how they say the brain is kind
[0:25:57] SPEAKER_00: of like a computer, like the subconscious mind is just being programmed.
[0:26:02] Unknown: The more I apologize for my existence, the more I'm in a feedback loop, almost like
[0:26:07] SPEAKER_00: planting seeds that I need to apologize for my existence.
[0:26:12] Unknown: Right. And since the brain can't differentiate so well, like past, present, future, it's
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_00: just like, OK, still here.
[0:26:21] SPEAKER_00: Still need to apologize for my existence.
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_00: And I have to imagine that if other people's words shaped and conditioned us, then to a
[0:26:30] SPEAKER_00: certain extent, how we're using our words and what stories we're focusing on are shaping
[0:26:37] SPEAKER_00: and conditioning us.
[0:26:38] SPEAKER_00: Right. It has to be some kind of feedback loop.
[0:26:42] SPEAKER_00: The giant caveat.
[0:26:44] SPEAKER_00: I want to reflect what you were saying before that cancel clear thing.
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_00: Right. This is where it gets sticky and where all teaching kind of gets sticky because it
[0:26:54] SPEAKER_00: takes some subtlety to have an alive relationship with it.
[0:27:01] SPEAKER_00: It's certainly not about faking it and it's certainly not about editing and deleting
[0:27:05] SPEAKER_00: yourself as that is harmful in and of itself.
[0:27:10] SPEAKER_00: So I'm not a believer like I've had friends who are like, don't say a negative thing.
[0:27:15] SPEAKER_00: Like if you say, God, I'm afraid that my parents are going to be upset with me.
[0:27:20] SPEAKER_00: And they're like, don't say fear.
[0:27:22] SPEAKER_00: Right. It's your superstitious option.
[0:27:24] Unknown: Yeah. Oh, my God.
[0:27:25] SPEAKER_00: You felt a bad feeling.
[0:27:26] SPEAKER_00: You're doomed.
[0:27:32] SPEAKER_00: I mean, people have very elegant teachings around this.
[0:27:34] SPEAKER_00: MatCon actually has very elegant teachings around this for people who want to go in
[0:27:38] SPEAKER_00: depth on this topic.
[0:27:39] Unknown: But from like the way my simple mind perceives of it is I'm like, if there is such a
[0:27:45] Unknown: thing as a universe that has a rhyme or reason, it certainly doesn't give a shit about
[0:27:52] SPEAKER_00: the words I use every once in a while.
[0:27:54] SPEAKER_00: It's tuning into something much deeper, much more alive.
[0:27:58] SPEAKER_00: And the rhyme or reason goes way beyond my passing moods, my passing thoughts and the
[0:28:05] SPEAKER_00: words I use.
[0:28:06] SPEAKER_00: That's how I feel about it.
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_00: So I never felt like that made any sense to me.
[0:28:11] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, sure.
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_00: What makes sense to me is to be alive and alive.
[0:28:16] SPEAKER_00: People have all sorts of feelings and I get to acknowledge the aliveness within me.
[0:28:21] SPEAKER_00: But what I can understand on the other perspective is that it can become like a persona,
[0:28:27] SPEAKER_00: like we did an episode on.
[0:28:29] Unknown: It can become kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy, because it's like if I believe as my
[0:28:38] Unknown: persona, let's say that I'm someone who needs help.
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_00: Right. When I was married to my ex-husband, I kind of occupied that space with him more
[0:28:49] SPEAKER_00: because he was really good at occupying the space of helper.
[0:28:53] SPEAKER_00: So I sort of joined him by occupying the space of helpee.
[0:28:59] SPEAKER_00: And then you start to speak about the help you need and you start to speak about your
[0:29:04] SPEAKER_00: problems and you start to share from that level.
[0:29:07] SPEAKER_00: And then people start to look at you as someone who needs help.
[0:29:09] Unknown: So they start to give you all sorts of handy advice and they start to do things for you
[0:29:16] SPEAKER_00: like the way, let's say if you were a little kid and you go home and you're like,
[0:29:19] SPEAKER_00: Mom, I have to do this school project.
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_00: And she's like, I'll do it.
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_00: It's like that.
[0:29:24] SPEAKER_00: They start to do it for you.
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_00: And all of that starts feeding a loop back to you going, oh my God, I'm helpless.
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_00: I couldn't do this without other people.
[0:29:34] SPEAKER_00: Or you're angry.
[0:29:35] SPEAKER_00: Why are other people treating me like I'm helpless?
[0:29:38] SPEAKER_00: Because you told them to.
[0:29:42] SPEAKER_00: You told them to.
[0:29:44] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you're innocent and they're innocent.
[0:29:47] SPEAKER_00: Everyone's innocent.
[0:29:48] SPEAKER_00: You may have done it because with that person, you really got the signal that that's what
[0:29:52] Unknown: they need to feel good.
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_00: And the empath just steps right in without overthinking it.
[0:29:59] SPEAKER_00: But this is what these conversations are for.
[0:30:01] SPEAKER_00: So we can start to have a different vantage point and a different consciousness and say,
[0:30:06] SPEAKER_00: that's so interesting.
[0:30:08] Unknown: What stories am I sharing about me when I can share 150?
[0:30:14] SPEAKER_00: Stories about me.
[0:30:18] Unknown: When I sit with people and do counseling work, you know you get them for one hour a week.
[0:30:24] SPEAKER_00: And in that hour, they're going to tell you some of their really deep core things.
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_00: Oftentimes the things they're stuck with or struggling with or in pain.
[0:30:33] Unknown: But that doesn't mean in that week, they didn't have five days where they were gloriously
[0:30:41] SPEAKER_00: like in gratitude and feeling blessed and contributing to the world at the highest
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_00: level possible rate.
[0:30:47] SPEAKER_00: It's like, this is just one experience.
[0:30:50] SPEAKER_00: And so in that container, it's meant to be like that.
[0:30:54] SPEAKER_00: But if it was my friends and the only way I felt like I could bond with them or get
[0:30:59] Unknown: close was to share just the pain I'm having, then a different thing arises.
[0:31:06] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the just want to kind of trace a little bit more what you two of the patterns you
[0:31:11] SPEAKER_00: brought up.
[0:31:12] SPEAKER_00: So there's the self-fulfilling prophecy one that you're just talking about, which I think
[0:31:17] SPEAKER_00: when we can see those with clarity and in a loving way in ourselves, like how great
[0:31:21] SPEAKER_00: because then we don't have to keep fulfilling the same prophecy we have about ourselves
[0:31:27] SPEAKER_00: unconsciously.
[0:31:28] SPEAKER_00: We don't have to keep getting the same feedback loop.
[0:31:30] SPEAKER_00: Like, oh my gosh, I could disrupt that and have different kinds of interactions and
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_00: relationships and beliefs and feelings.
[0:31:38] Unknown: So that is like a huge liberator to be able to see that.
[0:31:46] SPEAKER_00: And we already talked about experimenting without shame and blame.
[0:31:51] Unknown: And then the superstitious one, I just wanted to circle back to a little bit more because
[0:31:57] SPEAKER_00: it's really prevalent.
[0:31:59] SPEAKER_00: So interesting.
[0:32:00] Unknown: I mean, superstition has always ruled over these domains and organized religion has its
[0:32:06] SPEAKER_00: fair share.
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we could say a lot of it is superstition, a lot of spirituality superstitious, you
[0:32:13] SPEAKER_00: know, and then we have these kind of pop culture things like law of attraction and stuff.
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_00: And again, it becomes superstitious.
[0:32:18] Unknown: Like you will be again, it's God as other judging other who is there to dole out treats
[0:32:26] SPEAKER_00: or punishments, right, which all of us have woven into our beings because that's the
[0:32:32] SPEAKER_00: orientation that's been passed down and passed down and we're busting out of it.
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_00: But it's a pretty old habit.
[0:32:40] SPEAKER_00: And so if we the superstition can filter in in other places, right.
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_00: So if we're not engaged in some kind of spiritual practice that says I need to turn and circle
[0:32:48] SPEAKER_00: three times and say what I'm grateful for and, you know, and then I'll get my treats,
[0:32:52] SPEAKER_00: then it comes in in more subtle ways.
[0:32:56] SPEAKER_00: So recently, one of the ways the kind of cancel clear ways that I was noticing it happening
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_00: for me, I was talking about this a little bit the last episode we recorded that I'm
[0:33:08] SPEAKER_00: having this new vantage point and energy level for noticing my money stuff.
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_00: So when I log in on my bank account and I feel gross and I'm like, all right, money,
[0:33:19] SPEAKER_00: let's do this thing.
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_00: And that isn't like I love this.
[0:33:26] SPEAKER_00: I'm cancel clear, right?
[0:33:28] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm going to turn that angry feeling into a like, here I am, bank account, let's party.
[0:33:36] SPEAKER_00: What it actually can be.
[0:33:39] SPEAKER_00: And like I just moved today, as you know, so that just involves a certain amount of money
[0:33:44] SPEAKER_00: going out.
[0:33:45] SPEAKER_00: Not a big deal money you expect to go out, but like you're paying bigger bills for a little
[0:33:49] SPEAKER_00: while.
[0:33:50] Unknown: And so getting on my bank account, it was so refreshing to almost tempt the lightning
[0:33:57] Unknown: bolt and just be like, I hate this.
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_00: I hate it.
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_00: And just to be a little tantrumy and to really give voice to what was the truth.
[0:34:09] SPEAKER_00: I hate it.
[0:34:09] SPEAKER_00: I hate it.
[0:34:10] SPEAKER_00: I hate it.
[0:34:10] Unknown: I'm so fucking sick of every time new money shows up, something comes along to snatch it.
[0:34:17] SPEAKER_00: And like, I don't have the answers.
[0:34:19] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[0:34:19] SPEAKER_00: But I get to in this moment be exactly what I am, which is pissed off that something is
[0:34:25] SPEAKER_00: repeating itself, which can disrupt some of the superstition and some of the tendency
[0:34:30] SPEAKER_00: we have to muzzle ourselves.
[0:34:32] Unknown: Now, if that turns into if ego gets a hold of that, it wants to prolong it.
[0:34:39] SPEAKER_00: And it wants to turn it into an identity like, yeah, I'm the one that's mad.
[0:34:44] SPEAKER_00: I'm the one that's mad about money and I'm going to stomp around like Godzilla whenever
[0:34:48] Unknown: I feel this way from now on because ego makes it permanent and forever like this.
[0:34:55] Unknown: If we can just let it be a very genuine moment in time, if that is what's genuine, in this
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_00: case for me this week, it was how great.
[0:35:06] SPEAKER_00: I can disrupt the superstition that I'm not going to get struck by a lightning bolt.
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_00: Everything's not going to go to hell because I'm the most ungrateful, bad spiritual person
[0:35:15] SPEAKER_00: ever.
[0:35:15] SPEAKER_00: How dare I be ungrateful for my great life?
[0:35:18] SPEAKER_00: Or how dare I not be farther along on my path where I can easily do this and feel completely
[0:35:24] SPEAKER_00: at ease?
[0:35:25] SPEAKER_00: And I'm also not going, yeah, I'm going to be this one now.
[0:35:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to stomp around, get mad.
[0:35:31] SPEAKER_00: It's literally just the moment.
[0:35:32] SPEAKER_00: And things get so much softer and can unclog more quickly, honestly, because we're just
[0:35:38] SPEAKER_00: being whatever the hell we are in any given moment.
[0:35:40] Unknown: And we're not using words to say, I am the angry one who's going to complain about my
[0:35:46] SPEAKER_00: money situation all the time when I talk to people.
[0:35:49] SPEAKER_00: Or I am the ungrateful one or I am the whatever.
[0:35:55] Unknown: So with superstition, it's interesting because I think we all have it to different degrees
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_00: in our lives.
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_00: Like where are we believing that we're going to get in trouble if we're just whatever we
[0:36:07] SPEAKER_00: genuinely are in a moment?
[0:36:09] SPEAKER_00: Where does that come up?
[0:36:11] SPEAKER_00: And how can we let ourselves be whatever we actually are in order to break the hold of
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_00: superstition on us?
[0:36:18] SPEAKER_00: It does have, I think these things do have subtlety to it.
[0:36:23] SPEAKER_00: I think it's why it can be very easily confused and grabbed onto and used differently, right?
[0:36:30] Unknown: I'm remembering back while you're speaking to when I was in Miami and I had mold illness
[0:36:38] SPEAKER_00: and it was becoming clear to me that I had to move.
[0:36:42] SPEAKER_00: And my husband and I were having conversations like we have to leave our home, we have to
[0:36:47] Unknown: leave our city, which he loved.
[0:36:50] SPEAKER_00: And I was working with Cure and Trace at the time.
[0:36:53] SPEAKER_00: And of course, what was coming up for me was some of my core wounds.
[0:36:57] SPEAKER_00: I'm a weirdo being one of them.
[0:37:00] SPEAKER_00: But the other one being I'm a burden, which is one of the big ones, right?
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_00: And that's even the apologize for my existence.
[0:37:06] SPEAKER_00: Like I'm such a burden and making you get up right now, right?
[0:37:12] SPEAKER_00: And I remember her saying something to the effect.
[0:37:15] Unknown: I'm sure I'll paraphrase her wrong, but what she offered to me was don't keep telling
[0:37:21] Unknown: Mario you're such a burden for making him move because sooner or later, he just may
[0:37:26] SPEAKER_00: believe your story.
[0:37:28] SPEAKER_00: And like you planted the story.
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't real for him to begin with.
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_00: And I actually found that to be kind of sage.
[0:37:37] SPEAKER_00: And that's what's interesting though, because in any given moment, it would be easy to say
[0:37:44] SPEAKER_00: that what was true for me was I felt like a burden.
[0:37:46] Unknown: I mean, I felt like a burden for months as I was healing and needing all of this inside
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_00: of myself and coming to terms with moving and asking loved ones to come with me.
[0:38:00] Unknown: So at any given moment, it would have felt genuine to just say, oh, I'm so sorry.
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm burdening you.
[0:38:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry.
[0:38:08] SPEAKER_00: I'm doing this to you.
[0:38:09] SPEAKER_00: And there were certainly some where that it was what I was saying.
[0:38:13] Unknown: But just because that was there, does it need to be expressed outwardly?
[0:38:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm posing this as a question, not as a statement, like as an exploration, because I think this
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_00: is all interesting.
[0:38:27] SPEAKER_00: Because to me, I really got it when she said it.
[0:38:30] Unknown: And she was saying it for me with Mario in that moment.
[0:38:34] SPEAKER_00: So that doesn't mean it's a blanket statement for everyone.
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_00: But I really got what she was saying, because I understand how you can help someone's mind
[0:38:45] SPEAKER_00: see something a certain way if you work on it hard enough.
[0:38:48] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:38:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, if you work on it hard enough.
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: And I understood that.
[0:38:53] SPEAKER_00: I was like, it's true, because in reality, I could see with awareness.
[0:38:59] SPEAKER_00: This isn't a true belief.
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_00: It's not grounded in anything.
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_00: But when the belief comes up, feelings come up with it, and they can feel really alive.
[0:39:08] Unknown: And there could almost be some relief.
[0:39:11] SPEAKER_00: Like if I say, oh, gosh, I'm such a burden.
[0:39:14] SPEAKER_00: I'm so sorry to put you through this.
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_00: Like, poor you.
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_00: It can feel like a relief, because in that moment, he might then be like, oh, it's OK.
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_00: Oh, I can do this.
[0:39:25] SPEAKER_00: Or even if he was worst case scenario, to be like, yeah, it is really hard on me.
[0:39:29] SPEAKER_00: I at least feel like I'm apologizing.
[0:39:31] SPEAKER_00: I'm being the good person who sees that I am a burden, and I'm apologizing.
[0:39:36] SPEAKER_00: So either that's going to make me feel better, or he's going to say, no, no, no, you're OK.
[0:39:41] SPEAKER_00: And then that's going to make me feel better.
[0:39:43] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:39:43] Unknown: So in the moment of expression, we could say, it qualified as genuine.
[0:39:48] SPEAKER_00: And it did feel that way.
[0:39:50] Unknown: And we could say, I might get some relief.
[0:39:55] SPEAKER_00: But how many times?
[0:39:57] SPEAKER_00: The first time, the second, the 10th, the 20th, the 40th?
[0:40:03] Unknown: At what point does it not serve either of us anymore?
[0:40:08] Unknown: Does it not serve reality to be moving from a part of you that is just a wound?
[0:40:17] SPEAKER_00: Like, not true.
[0:40:19] SPEAKER_00: Not arising from clarity, not arising from love.
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_00: So I think that's where it gets interesting because I'm super into not editing myself.
[0:40:27] SPEAKER_00: So I don't really do that.
[0:40:29] SPEAKER_00: I am mindful.
[0:40:30] SPEAKER_00: I will bring awareness.
[0:40:32] SPEAKER_00: But like the whole, you know, we're using the words cancel clear is just an example
[0:40:36] SPEAKER_00: for what we're talking about.
[0:40:37] SPEAKER_00: That whole energy of, oh, my God, don't use that word or you'll create it.
[0:40:42] SPEAKER_00: I've never really gotten into.
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, I'll do the healing until the right words come out rather than
[0:40:47] SPEAKER_00: edit like the branch to get to the root.
[0:40:51] Unknown: But I also understand there is a certain amount where like, you know, our brains are programmable.
[0:40:59] SPEAKER_00: I mean, that is true.
[0:41:00] SPEAKER_00: And so are others.
[0:41:02] SPEAKER_00: And so how much do we keep moving from and speaking from what's ultimately a wound,
[0:41:08] SPEAKER_00: ultimately not grounded in truth?
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_00: How does it affect others?
[0:41:13] SPEAKER_00: But more importantly, how does it affect us both when we hear ourselves say those words
[0:41:20] SPEAKER_00: and when others may respond to us as if those words are true?
[0:41:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm really glad this came up because it's like important layers of subtlety.
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_00: So some of the distinctions that I see between your example and my example, one is like the
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm a burden is on the layer of identity to core wound about your identity.
[0:41:41] SPEAKER_00: And so my parallel in my circumstance would have been something like I am a hopeless financial
[0:41:49] SPEAKER_00: fuck up. It'll never turn around for me.
[0:41:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm the worst.
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_00: So if I had really leaned into that, it would be it would have been like,
[0:41:58] SPEAKER_00: I am this.
[0:42:01] SPEAKER_00: I am this.
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_00: I really am this, you know, like that kind of thing.
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_00: But instead of being like solid and concrete.
[0:42:09] Unknown: And it's reinforcing I am that, you know, and instead it was I see this pattern.
[0:42:15] SPEAKER_00: I have been watching this pattern.
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_00: I know that I am not it, but it is still here.
[0:42:21] SPEAKER_00: I experience feeling angry, frustrated.
[0:42:26] Unknown: And so in my case, it would have been a way of sitting on myself in that moment to not
[0:42:33] SPEAKER_00: acknowledge I feel angry, which was different than going back into the old core wound person.
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_00: I am it is hopeless for me.
[0:42:41] Unknown: I never works out for Brooke, you know, and so that turning towards the I see this with clarity.
[0:42:51] Unknown: This is just a belief system, a thought form and a repeating pattern because of I don't
[0:42:57] SPEAKER_00: know why it's the mystery.
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_00: Plenty of things I could point out and plenty of things I couldn't point out about why it
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_00: comes to be.
[0:43:06] SPEAKER_00: And the feeling of anger, I've spent so much time and energy turning away from.
[0:43:11] SPEAKER_00: And like, no, you know, this is just a passing phase.
[0:43:15] SPEAKER_00: We've been here before.
[0:43:17] SPEAKER_00: You're going to get through it, all of which are very healthy things and behaviors and attitudes
[0:43:21] SPEAKER_00: to take.
[0:43:21] SPEAKER_00: And they've served me quite well.
[0:43:23] SPEAKER_00: But for whatever reason, it was pressurized in this way.
[0:43:25] SPEAKER_00: Well, what really wanted to be attended to was I just feel really fucking pissed off.
[0:43:30] SPEAKER_00: Just feel frustrated.
[0:43:31] SPEAKER_00: Feel really tired.
[0:43:33] SPEAKER_00: And so because that was in that moment so genuine and so wanting to be acknowledged,
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_00: it was liberating because it was what wanted to be acknowledged and really seen.
[0:43:46] SPEAKER_00: And these things are so subtle and so tricky because that's very different than thinking
[0:43:52] SPEAKER_00: that the like it's such a relief to just admit that I'm a hopeless case or whatever.
[0:43:59] Unknown: You know, that's just identity getting its hands around you and being like,
[0:44:05] SPEAKER_00: yes, it is true.
[0:44:08] SPEAKER_00: So we have to play with it in ourselves.
[0:44:10] SPEAKER_00: And I think you use the phrase like what's alive in the moment.
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_00: The alive relationship to ourselves and our lives and these patterns and how they move in us and
[0:44:24] Unknown: how they shift and how they don't shift is such a close and intimate thing that can't be prescribed.
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_00: We can't give the blueprint fix all for anyone.
[0:44:36] Unknown: Thank God, you know, that it gets to be everyone's individual journey instead of somebody who has all
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_00: the answers for everyone because we've seen plenty of people pretend that that's true.
[0:44:47] SPEAKER_00: And it doesn't work out great.
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, I guess it's like the way I picture it in my mind is
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_00: how close is it?
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_00: Do you believe you are it?
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_00: Is it an identity?
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_00: Or is it taking the small world ride instead of being the animatronic in the small world ride where
[0:45:09] SPEAKER_00: you're like, I am watching this and I'm a human being.
[0:45:13] Unknown: I don't just feel like, you know, because I can see the pattern, I just feel endlessly great inside
[0:45:23] SPEAKER_00: because it's just a pattern.
[0:45:25] SPEAKER_00: You know, in my experience, that's not true.
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_00: Sometimes patterns are really, really light like that and they let go very easily and it does feel
[0:45:32] SPEAKER_00: quite soft.
[0:45:33] SPEAKER_00: But we all have the ones that are more entrenched for each of us.
[0:45:36] Unknown: I think even that differentiation, which was great, you know, won't always be true.
[0:45:44] SPEAKER_00: So that's where it circles back to the fine tuning for you because there will be moments when,
[0:45:51] Unknown: even though, let's say, I believe I'm a burden in a moment where me sharing that identity will be
[0:45:59] SPEAKER_00: helpful and healing.
[0:46:01] Unknown: There'll be many moments, maybe with your lover, maybe with a family member, you know, maybe with
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_00: a friend or with your therapist or whomever.
[0:46:10] SPEAKER_00: There's going to be moments when bringing that out into the light has its own intelligence in it,
[0:46:16] Unknown: you know, speaking those words.
[0:46:17] SPEAKER_00: Because sometimes, too, when you say something, you yourself begin to see like, that can't
[0:46:23] SPEAKER_00: possibly be true.
[0:46:25] Unknown: But the thought when it was like inside my head had more like heft to it.
[0:46:31] SPEAKER_00: And then I verbalize like, I have to apologize for my existence.
[0:46:36] SPEAKER_00: And like, even as I say it, I'm like, that can't possibly be true.
[0:46:39] SPEAKER_00: I get I feel that way.
[0:46:42] Unknown: But, you know, so there's always going to be a time and place.
[0:46:45] Unknown: I suppose what was interesting to me about this conversation is just when they become
[0:46:52] SPEAKER_00: the ways we go to like our default ways of engaging with the world, right?
[0:46:58] Unknown: Like, how have we been taught with other people's words and other people's actions and other
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_00: people's lack of words to show up?
[0:47:09] Unknown: And how does that influence then what we choose to share?
[0:47:13] SPEAKER_00: How we share?
[0:47:14] SPEAKER_00: What about us we share?
[0:47:17] SPEAKER_00: How we share?
[0:47:18] SPEAKER_00: What about us we share?
[0:47:20] Unknown: When we are like these miracles who are full of so much we could.
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_00: And so where it gets most interesting to me is simply where you see patterns.
[0:47:30] Unknown: You know, so if like divine intelligence in one moment says, you know, open up and share
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_00: with this human you're getting to know that sometimes you feel like the piece of crap
[0:47:42] SPEAKER_00: who's never figuring it out, right?
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_00: Then there might be some real intimacy to be born from that moment or some real healing
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_00: right around the corner from it.
[0:47:52] SPEAKER_00: But if you notice that, you know, every time you meet someone or every time you go on a
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_00: first date, you're already telling that story.
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_00: Yes, right.
[0:48:01] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:48:02] SPEAKER_00: Like kind of persona is coming out.
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_00: I have a friend of mine, she's so dear to my heart.
[0:48:10] SPEAKER_00: And she was struggling a lot about dating around dating.
[0:48:13] SPEAKER_00: And one of the things I noticed when I was sitting with her one night, two guys started
[0:48:17] SPEAKER_00: talking to us and they were very, you know, eligible looking men and you know, cute and
[0:48:22] SPEAKER_00: they were talking to us.
[0:48:24] SPEAKER_00: Within 15 minutes, she told the story about how she was super drunk last night.
[0:48:29] Unknown: You know, she had like been hung over and like basically a story about her promiscuity.
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_00: And it happened in the span of 15 minutes.
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_00: Now, this woman has a lot to offer a human being that goes beyond that.
[0:48:44] SPEAKER_00: But you can see, I don't think people should judge.
[0:48:47] SPEAKER_00: I certainly don't judge promiscuity like hello.
[0:48:50] SPEAKER_00: And I certainly don't judge drinking.
[0:48:53] SPEAKER_00: But you can see how if you're just meeting someone, depending on what story you tell,
[0:49:00] SPEAKER_00: it changes how they're looking at you, right?
[0:49:02] SPEAKER_00: Because everyone's trying to figure out like, oh, who is this person?
[0:49:06] SPEAKER_00: What did they require of me?
[0:49:07] SPEAKER_00: What is it they may want?
[0:49:09] SPEAKER_00: What would make them feel good?
[0:49:10] SPEAKER_00: Everyone's just innately trying to figure that out.
[0:49:13] SPEAKER_00: That's like an intrinsic mechanism of a human body that is trying to assess that.
[0:49:19] SPEAKER_00: So I thought, well, if within the first 10 minutes she said that, they're already now
[0:49:24] SPEAKER_00: putting, they're like, oh, do you want to do shots?
[0:49:26] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:49:27] SPEAKER_00: They're filing it into a certain compartment.
[0:49:30] Unknown: Again, I don't judge if anyone does that.
[0:49:32] SPEAKER_00: I have drank and I have slept around.
[0:49:35] SPEAKER_00: Just saying, right?
[0:49:37] SPEAKER_00: You're putting yourself into a certain kind of persona.
[0:49:40] SPEAKER_00: And the hard part for her is all she wanted was like love in a relationship.
[0:49:46] SPEAKER_00: And then she's like, how come people are only seeing me as the fun party girl
[0:49:51] SPEAKER_00: that they go out with and they have a good time with?
[0:49:55] SPEAKER_00: So anyway, that's obviously not all to the story.
[0:49:58] SPEAKER_00: But it was an interesting moment for me to observe and to be able to talk about with her.
[0:50:04] Unknown: And anytime we see those moments, like, I don't know, let's say you and I have the
[0:50:08] SPEAKER_00: opportunity now to speak to teachers, right?
[0:50:13] SPEAKER_00: When we do.
[0:50:13] SPEAKER_00: So let's say for the first time we met them, we were like, oh my God, we don't even know
[0:50:17] SPEAKER_00: what we're doing.
[0:50:18] SPEAKER_00: We're so sorry.
[0:50:20] SPEAKER_00: Bear with us.
[0:50:21] SPEAKER_00: I'm not good at this.
[0:50:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: Like, then do they want to talk for 75 minutes to us?
[0:50:27] SPEAKER_00: Like when we're at the Science and Nonduality Conference, if we're introducing ourselves,
[0:50:31] SPEAKER_00: it's like we're newbies.
[0:50:32] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[0:50:33] SPEAKER_00: We'd be so like humbled if you even came on because we barely know what we're doing.
[0:50:37] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:50:38] SPEAKER_00: We're probably not going to get people to want to book.
[0:50:43] SPEAKER_00: And I'm being sort of light about it, but like we do that in some way, shape or form.
[0:50:48] SPEAKER_00: So what I think is most interesting is just bringing your own mindfulness on a really
[0:50:55] SPEAKER_00: nice loving experiment, which is probably where self-love at the base is always the
[0:51:00] SPEAKER_00: most important thing because then you don't have to shame yourself when you notice the
[0:51:03] SPEAKER_00: pattern.
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_00: So always with that, but where you go, oh my God, that's so interesting.
[0:51:08] SPEAKER_00: What did I just tell this new human I met?
[0:51:10] Unknown: Or what did I just write in like 10 out of 15 of my texts?
[0:51:15] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:51:16] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:51:16] SPEAKER_00: Like that's so interesting.
[0:51:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:51:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm not a big Wayne Dyer person.
[0:51:21] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I'm not against the guy.
[0:51:22] SPEAKER_00: I'm just saying I haven't read his work very much, but a quote of his has stuck in my mind
[0:51:27] Unknown: for years.
[0:51:28] SPEAKER_00: I feel like I heard it 15 years ago or something, which is just that you teach people how to
[0:51:33] SPEAKER_00: treat you.
[0:51:34] SPEAKER_00: It's so succinct.
[0:51:35] SPEAKER_00: It's so simple and it's so true and it's always stuck with me because then it can just
[0:51:39] Unknown: become an inquiry.
[0:51:43] SPEAKER_00: If we all are teaching people how to treat us, what am I teaching people?
[0:51:48] SPEAKER_00: And that is the alive exploration where it shifts and changes over the minutes, days
[0:51:54] SPEAKER_00: and years.
[0:51:56] SPEAKER_00: But it's interesting.
[0:51:57] SPEAKER_00: It's interesting to live that inquiry.
[0:52:00] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:52:01] SPEAKER_00: And to allow it to be an inquiry because what gets tricky is it's not about necessarily
[0:52:08] SPEAKER_00: then trying to find the good things to teach people because then that can arise from just
[0:52:13] SPEAKER_00: another feeling of deficit.
[0:52:15] SPEAKER_00: It can arise from you...
[0:52:16] SPEAKER_00: I need to be the optimistic one.
[0:52:18] SPEAKER_00: ...shallacking yourself into a person.
[0:52:20] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[0:52:21] Unknown: Right.
[0:52:22] Unknown: Yet, if we can have a really open hand of awareness and curiosity and play, at first,
[0:52:31] SPEAKER_00: just recognize you don't have to do anything.
[0:52:33] SPEAKER_00: Start with what Brooke said in the beginning.
[0:52:35] Unknown: Start with don't do anything and then just be curious.
[0:52:38] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:52:39] SPEAKER_00: Like, oh, that's interesting.
[0:52:40] SPEAKER_00: I'm observing, aware.
[0:52:42] SPEAKER_00: And then at some point, the awareness may bubble enough where you're like, I'm going
[0:52:45] SPEAKER_00: to try a fun little experiment.
[0:52:47] Unknown: I'm going to try a fun little experiment where when I meet this person, I'm going to
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_00: tell them about what I'm really proud of instead of tell them about what's really hard for
[0:52:57] SPEAKER_00: me.
[0:52:58] SPEAKER_00: Just as an experiment, how does that feel?
[0:53:01] SPEAKER_00: Does it feel genuine?
[0:53:02] SPEAKER_00: Can I stay in my body while I talk about that?
[0:53:05] SPEAKER_00: How did they respond?
[0:53:07] SPEAKER_00: Does it feel good?
[0:53:08] SPEAKER_00: Does it shift something?
[0:53:09] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[0:53:10] SPEAKER_00: Well, I did that thing again where I talked about how hard it was for me.
[0:53:14] SPEAKER_00: Cool.
[0:53:14] SPEAKER_00: How was that in that moment?
[0:53:16] SPEAKER_00: Did I feel in my body?
[0:53:17] SPEAKER_00: Did I feel present?
[0:53:19] SPEAKER_00: How did they respond?
[0:53:20] SPEAKER_00: How did they treat me?
[0:53:21] SPEAKER_00: Did it feel good?
[0:53:22] SPEAKER_00: Did it feel aligned?
[0:53:23] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[0:53:24] SPEAKER_00: So it's like, gosh, we have to just be gently curious, gently curious, gently curious,
[0:53:30] Unknown: super inquisitive, and be really alive with the whole experiment because I think it's true
[0:53:38] SPEAKER_00: for what we always talk about.
[0:53:40] SPEAKER_00: There's no actual rule book, but there really isn't.
[0:53:43] SPEAKER_00: It's why they talk about spiritual materialism or why Matt Konzo is changing his teaching
[0:53:49] SPEAKER_00: so that the ego can't quite grab onto it is because these things, everyone wants it to
[0:53:54] SPEAKER_00: go, okay, great.
[0:53:56] SPEAKER_00: So I never say what I feel.
[0:53:57] Unknown: Okay, great.
[0:53:59] SPEAKER_00: So I only say the positive things like that's what we all want.
[0:54:03] SPEAKER_00: Bless us.
[0:54:04] SPEAKER_00: Mercy to the humans.
[0:54:07] SPEAKER_00: But that's not going to get you in a live experience.
[0:54:09] Unknown: The live experience is saying open, curious, self-loving, other loving, inquisitive, observing,
[0:54:18] Unknown: conscious, aware, and then playing with reality a little bit.
[0:54:27] SPEAKER_00: Thank you so very much for listening to today's show.

[0:54:35] SPEAKER_00: and the specifics for this show will be within this episode's post.
[0:54:40] SPEAKER_00: One bit of news, we'll be taking a summer integration break.
[0:54:44] SPEAKER_00: So we should have at least one more episode coming at you after this, but then we're going
[0:54:48] SPEAKER_00: to be on break for the very end of July through the month of August, and that will include
[0:54:53] SPEAKER_00: a social media break.
[0:54:55] Unknown: It's always nice to have some time to pause and let everything deeply marinate or get
[0:55:00] SPEAKER_00: the hell away from the iPhone or both.
[0:55:03] SPEAKER_00: So while we do that, you can have some integration time for yourselves too.
[0:55:06] SPEAKER_00: We will be back for sure in the fall, right around about the two-year anniversary of the
[0:55:11] SPEAKER_00: show, which is exciting.
[0:55:12] SPEAKER_00: If you want a little connection and support from us during that break, just remember there's
[0:55:16] SPEAKER_00: always the Patreon private forum for supporting members.
[0:55:19] SPEAKER_00: That's patreon.com forward slash bliss and grit.
[0:55:22] SPEAKER_00: And Vanessa and I also both work privately with clients all over the world.
[0:55:26] SPEAKER_00: Thank you to the magic of the intro webs.
[0:55:30] SPEAKER_00: So information about that and how to find our private practices, that's also linked
[0:55:33] SPEAKER_00: on the bliss and grit website.
[0:55:34] SPEAKER_00: Or you can go to vannessascotto.com or brookthomas.me.
[0:55:39] SPEAKER_00: We are so grateful for all of you.
[0:55:41] SPEAKER_00: As we head towards two years, it's just so sweet to see that there's been this amazing
[0:55:45] Unknown: community to get your emails, your notes, your thoughtful feedback and how much this
[0:55:54] SPEAKER_00: has meant to you.
[0:55:55] SPEAKER_00: And just to meet all of you, I mean, it's crazy.
