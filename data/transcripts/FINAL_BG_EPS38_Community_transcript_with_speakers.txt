[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Brooke Thomas. I'm going to
[0:00:10] SPEAKER_00: be joined soon by my very dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scato. On the show, we're
[0:00:15] SPEAKER_00: talking about being on the embodied spiritual path and what does that even mean? So what's
[0:00:19] SPEAKER_00: a real evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? The beauty and crazy,
[0:00:25] SPEAKER_00: the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. We're attempting
[0:00:29] Unknown: to sort it out for ourselves here on the show. In today's episode, we're talking about the
[0:00:34] SPEAKER_00: importance of having your people with you on the spiritual path. So if you're somebody
[0:00:39] SPEAKER_00: who is getting curious about and in many ways no longer fully living by the conditioning
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_00: of your own life and of your culture's preferences, it can be strange and it can be lonely sometimes.
[0:00:51] SPEAKER_00: And you know, in Buddhism, one of the key jewels of the path is called the Sangha. For
[0:00:55] SPEAKER_00: those of you who don't skew Buddhist, it's basically about having a community of people
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_00: who can be with you on the path. So people who are committed to being with reality, people
[0:01:06] SPEAKER_00: who get the journey that you're undertaking. And today Vanessa and I are talking about
[0:01:11] SPEAKER_00: a number of things related to this. Things like coming out of the spiritual closet, all
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_00: the typical human things that come up in real sanghas, how to find your people or even just
[0:01:21] SPEAKER_00: one person and why supportive community is so important. A quick bit of news, we're actually
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_00: hosting our own quasi digital sangha, kind of, sort of, for six weeks beginning at the
[0:01:34] SPEAKER_00: end of June. We're calling it the Being Human series. So if you want to deepen the conversation
[0:01:38] SPEAKER_00: with us and other Bliss and Grit listeners, you can check out all the details at blissandgrit.com
[0:01:44] Unknown: forward slash being human. And you can also just click on the events tab of the website
[0:01:49] Unknown: if you want to scope out what we're up to. The last thing before we head into the conversation,
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_00: we have potty mouths. If you've listened before, you know that. If you haven't, you're probably
[0:01:58] SPEAKER_00: going to want to wear some headphones if you're hanging out with your kids. Okay, here we go.
[0:02:02] Unknown: Hello, beautiful. Hello, darling. I was listening recently to a Dharma Ocean podcast. So that's
[0:02:13] Unknown: Reggie Ray. And Dharma Ocean is the lineage that we practice in, although it's gone all
[0:02:19] SPEAKER_00: kinds of places from there. But in any case, I will put in the show notes the link to this
[0:02:24] SPEAKER_00: specific episode because the name of it is escaping me. But he was talking about several
[0:02:30] Unknown: things including the sangha. So for those of you listening who are not like in Buddhist-ish
[0:02:36] SPEAKER_00: orbits, the sangha just means the community of people who are on the path with you, like
[0:02:42] SPEAKER_00: who you actually know and interact with and talk to about being on the path. So it occurred
[0:02:47] SPEAKER_00: to me like we haven't talked about the sangha so much and we are just kicking off the Being
[0:02:53] SPEAKER_00: Human series, which is like our own six-week digital version kind of sort of a sangha. I was
[0:02:59] SPEAKER_00: like, oh, we should kind of talk-ish. I mean, it's a bunch of things, but it's interesting to talk
[0:03:05] SPEAKER_00: about the community piece. So I have a couple of quotes from the episode that I'd like to read.
[0:03:09] SPEAKER_00: And then we can, you know, riff off those, talk about what we think about the importance of
[0:03:16] SPEAKER_00: community on the path. So the first quote is, the sangha is people who are committed to not
[0:03:21] Unknown: hiding, which I love. And the second quote, you know, because when you hear that, I think a lot
[0:03:28] SPEAKER_00: of people hear that it's sharp and fierce as Reggie is. And the second quote is, the mark of
[0:03:34] SPEAKER_00: the sangha is joy, the joyfulness of people who do not have to pretend to be anything other than
[0:03:40] Unknown: who they are. And I think those two things taken together provide all kinds of rich reflection
[0:03:49] Unknown: about why do we, why is it useful to endeavor to do this with a community with some kind of group?
[0:03:57] SPEAKER_00: Well, the first thing that occurs to me is how rare it is to find either of those things.
[0:04:04] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, even in the designated places called the sangha.
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_00: I mean, everywhere, you know, it's just such a rich idea to think that you're in a group of people
[0:04:13] SPEAKER_00: who are genuinely committed to not hiding, you know, like just that starting there. And then to
[0:04:20] SPEAKER_00: think furthermore, that everyone gets to be themselves and kind of bathe in this beautiful
[0:04:25] Unknown: joy that comes from spontaneous being. And I guess maybe one thing that it highlighted for me is just,
[0:04:33] Unknown: I think we all crave that. And it's a little bit rare. It's very rare. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. And
[0:04:41] SPEAKER_00: even before you get into the context of like a spiritual community, as in like a formalized
[0:04:47] SPEAKER_00: group that we practice in and meditate in, like what a sangha really is. So many people, even like
[0:04:55] SPEAKER_00: listeners that email us or message us, so many of my clients, so many of my friends, feel really
[0:05:01] Unknown: alone in their journey. Sometimes, obviously, people feel very alone in their life. But
[0:05:08] SPEAKER_00: even if they have a rich network of friends, they'll feel like they have no one to talk about
[0:05:13] Unknown: their spiritual path with and that they have, I guess, no one to share all those deep,
[0:05:20] SPEAKER_00: thinky things that we do, all those sensey things, all those like, existential kind of
[0:05:26] Unknown: convos that we have. And so I guess before we even get into like those layers of the sangha,
[0:05:34] Unknown: we could just reflect on why being with a group of people when you're on this journey
[0:05:41] Unknown: can be essential. Yeah, and I think it comes down to acknowledging that this is not what's up in the
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_00: dominant culture. The dominant culture is about whatever we've been domesticated to believe,
[0:05:58] SPEAKER_00: which is being polite or achieving success. And success means this, or even all the much, much
[0:06:05] SPEAKER_00: tinier contortions of wearing the kinds of masks that you got feedback were appealing masks versus
[0:06:11] Unknown: things that were unappealing. But we're essentially not being our true selves. We're not being our
[0:06:18] SPEAKER_00: genuine selves. And I would say that the journey to enlightenment is just really being yourself.
[0:06:23] SPEAKER_00: And I know people would agree. And then you realize certain things, like, oh, whatever,
[0:06:31] SPEAKER_00: all is one, blah, blah, blah. We don't need to go down that road. But I'm just saying that because
[0:06:36] Unknown: people can hear like, oh, just being myself. And the journey to what that actually is,
[0:06:41] SPEAKER_00: is really quite something, especially in the container of a culture that does not want you
[0:06:46] Unknown: to do that, or does not have a ton of models of people who are doing that. So, you know, in theory,
[0:06:55] SPEAKER_00: ideally, Sangha is a place where you're all acknowledging we're on the path. And on the path
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_00: doesn't mean I know a bunch of fancy Sanskrit words. Plenty of people think that is what it is.
[0:07:11] SPEAKER_00: And on the path doesn't mean, you know, that I'm having mystical experiences or whatever.
[0:07:16] SPEAKER_00: Or that I'm grabbing the brass ring of enlightenment, because the ego likes to turn
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_00: that into a project to for sure for sure. It's just like we're all saying we're taking this
[0:07:25] SPEAKER_00: journey towards real genuineness and really being here, you know, really being present and not
[0:07:33] SPEAKER_00: toggling between past and future. And that's a big deal. And it is lonely, because we're doing it in a
[0:07:39] SPEAKER_00: world that doesn't understand that. And it's so funny, as you were talking, I was like, oh, my god,
[0:07:44] SPEAKER_00: I was remembering, so it's Memorial Day weekend that we're recording. So lots of gatherings of
[0:07:50] SPEAKER_00: friends and stuff. And I'm having this experience lately, where I'm realizing how much I have been
[0:07:55] Unknown: in the closet as a person on the path as in my New Haven life. So I have a very dear group of
[0:08:06] SPEAKER_00: friends, and I and some of them are starting to listen to the show. And what what happens for me,
[0:08:13] Unknown: Hi, friends. I'm like, Oh, like, I get scared when they tell me they're listening or like,
[0:08:18] SPEAKER_00: I'm a little embarrassed. Or it's so funny, like, you and I have been doing this together forever.
[0:08:25] SPEAKER_00: And so it's just like, we've always said all the things to each other about this. But then suddenly,
[0:08:31] SPEAKER_00: like I was at a big barbecue on Friday night, tons of my friends, all the kids running around like
[0:08:37] SPEAKER_00: that kind of like very joyful gathering with people who haven't seen a long time. And
[0:08:43] SPEAKER_00: one of them sat next to me at dinner. And he was just like, telling me how we'd listened to the
[0:08:49] SPEAKER_00: Judith Blackstone episode on liberated body. I know he's listened to liberated body for a long
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_00: time. And he's like, and I'm starting to listen to Bliss and Grit too. And I was like, oh,
[0:08:59] Unknown: the one where I say words like, God, and
[0:09:03] SPEAKER_00: enlightenment.
[0:09:05] SPEAKER_00: Waking up, I'm like, oh, and I said, you know, and I just had to kind of come clean,
[0:09:10] SPEAKER_00: because I noticed that little like flinch in myself. And I said, you know, it's so funny,
[0:09:14] SPEAKER_00: because people in my life are starting to tell me this, who I haven't, I'm realizing it's like
[0:09:21] Unknown: coming out of the closet for me. And it's actually a process of, of linking up my own
[0:09:27] Unknown: genuineness and acknowledging like just how much this is everything to me. And that I have to
[0:09:36] SPEAKER_00: connect that to the people in my life who aren't necessarily on the path, because who cares? Like,
[0:09:40] SPEAKER_00: I don't need the people in my life to be on the path. But I certainly can't hide something that
[0:09:45] SPEAKER_00: has become such a fundamentally huge part of my life. And it's kind of all I care about,
[0:09:54] SPEAKER_00: which sounds terrible. Because then people are like, what do you mean about your kid?
[0:09:57] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, well, no, no, no, like, everything else goes great if this comes first. So it's what
[0:10:01] SPEAKER_00: I care about the most. But it's, it's fascinating, like, I've had to watch myself,
[0:10:08] SPEAKER_00: how I'm compartmentalizing, right? And there's this shyness about like, acknowledging that this
[0:10:14] Unknown: is my priority is coming home to reality, giving birth to myself, whatever you want to call it,
[0:10:23] SPEAKER_00: because all the other words, spirituality and enlightenment stuff have been corrupted so much.
[0:10:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm shy just hearing those words giving birth to myself.
[0:10:33] SPEAKER_00: I don't say that at the barbecue.
[0:10:37] Unknown: That's what I'm saying now. I was thinking that. So okay, just to let you all in on what I'm about
[0:10:46] SPEAKER_00: to say. So Brooke and I all like send each other ideas for the episode as things happen in our own
[0:10:50] SPEAKER_00: lives. So Brooke this morning sent me this idea like, okay, let's talk about the song. But before
[0:10:55] Unknown: you sent me that one of the things that was on my mind, that I hadn't texted you yet, and the thread
[0:11:01] SPEAKER_00: of things I was texting you was coming out of the spiritual closet and why that's so hard for people.
[0:11:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's really I'm realizing I'm like, oh, shit, I put this, I just didn't think that anyone in
[0:11:10] SPEAKER_00: my real life would listen to this. Yes, but we but that's like a whole episode, I think, but I do
[0:11:16] SPEAKER_00: think it's relevant here. But I think we could talk a lot about why that's so hard, because it's
[0:11:19] SPEAKER_00: actually gooey and gooey and very rich. But it is interesting. What did he say? I mean, you gave all
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_00: that caveat, I just want to know. You know, it's so funny is that like what he said, which is not at
[0:11:30] SPEAKER_00: all what I expected him to say. He said, you know what, it's been it's been something I've done
[0:11:37] SPEAKER_00: really quietly and on my own to being on the spiritual path, he said, and so maybe we'll both
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_00: come out of the closet together. I'm so glad to know that you feel that way, too. So I just
[0:11:49] SPEAKER_00: know that's always going to be the answer in some way. Yeah, I don't know. I think some of my friends
[0:11:54] Unknown: are like, wow, Brooke says God a lot more than she is. And they adore me to pieces still. And I adore
[0:12:01] SPEAKER_00: them too. But I don't know that they're ever going to be like, let's talk about God. But that's okay.
[0:12:07] SPEAKER_00: But in that case, I was like, it was this really sweet moment where it was like, you know, neither
[0:12:13] Unknown: one of us had to feel alone in being on the path and like being at this big, noisy, super fun barbecue
[0:12:21] SPEAKER_00: totally out of the context, right? Like it's not serious deep thoughts time.
[0:12:26] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Talking about this kind of stuff. I know I always get most embarrassed when I think
[0:12:31] SPEAKER_00: like my family is going to hear. But I grew up in like a family of teasers, you know, everybody
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_00: teases everybody. And like, it is very shy and vulnerable. And I guess this is speaking to why
[0:12:42] Unknown: you need a song because because a lot of the ways in which we're healing is learning to be vulnerable,
[0:12:51] SPEAKER_00: right? Learning to experience all those painful feelings that we felt were too vulnerable to
[0:12:56] SPEAKER_00: experience. Learning to do it in communion with others. You know, that's a lot of how
[0:13:03] SPEAKER_00: the healing path looks. That's a lot of what's being generated. And so we can do it alone to
[0:13:10] Unknown: a certain extent, right? Like, maybe you have a teacher or a mentor, maybe you just read books,
[0:13:17] Unknown: or you practice via headspace or something. And we could do a lot alone. But ultimately,
[0:13:23] SPEAKER_00: this wound, where we're embarrassed to be ourselves in front of people, or like mine,
[0:13:29] SPEAKER_00: where I think everybody's going to think I'm weird, I'm like literally going through it right now.
[0:13:35] Unknown: In the trenches with it.
[0:13:39] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, like not nowish, but like right now where you perceive that people are going to see you as
[0:13:44] Unknown: different or other or weird, or like we've talked about in the Sensi episode, like too much,
[0:13:51] SPEAKER_00: you know, this wound that those belief systems are the very ones that the sangha is there
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_00: to, I don't know if heal is right, but to reflect.
[0:14:03] Unknown: Yeah. Yeah. Like, there's things that happen when you go along in the path where you,
[0:14:10] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you don't fit in. There are many ways where you start to not fit in. And it can be
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_00: quite uncomfortable. Like I think about just simple things, you know. So again, party weekend,
[0:14:22] SPEAKER_00: right? Like Friday and Saturday was a bunch of time with two different friend groups. And
[0:14:25] Unknown: you know, people would ask me about like future plans of mine, or ask me if I was feeling upset
[0:14:37] SPEAKER_00: or worried about current stuff going on with me, you know, in a very sweet, very genuine,
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_00: like it's a friend check-in, right? And my answer, like my genuine answer was just like,
[0:14:50] SPEAKER_00: I just don't think it's a problem. Like I just feel fine about it. Like I couldn't find,
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_00: I could see how me in the past would have had all kinds of thoughts and ideas and feelings about
[0:15:04] SPEAKER_00: problems, you know, like it is a problem and I need to jump out into the future and kind of
[0:15:08] SPEAKER_00: plan for this and, or like, or this is hitting on in the past, this other thing happened and oh,
[0:15:14] SPEAKER_00: it's happening again and I couldn't feel any of those things. I just felt like everything was
[0:15:21] SPEAKER_00: fine. Like none of the stories held, none of the pain bodies were getting triggered. They still do.
[0:15:25] SPEAKER_00: But like here I am having this moment where it's like, the expectation is all the stories and all
[0:15:32] SPEAKER_00: of the emotion and maybe drama or anxiety or worry. And I just, I was just like, I just feel like it's
[0:15:38] SPEAKER_00: all fine. And so of course there's this moment where like genuine friends would, it's like,
[0:15:44] Unknown: is this really what's going on for her or is like, or is she in denial or is she blah, blah, blah?
[0:15:51] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's all fine and good and valid in the sense of like friends check in on you.
[0:15:58] SPEAKER_00: But if you have people who are on the path with you, you know, something that you and I do
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_00: for each other, obviously, it's why we started the show is because we have these conversations,
[0:16:07] SPEAKER_00: just the two of us all the time is like, I can talk to you and be like, I don't know, like I'm
[0:16:13] SPEAKER_00: in this place where I can't believe that any of my pain bodies are true for this particular
[0:16:19] Unknown: period of time. And it's so interesting, because I can't get hooked by drama, I can't think about
[0:16:25] SPEAKER_00: the past or the future. And so I'm just like this person that's like, yeah, no, it's fine.
[0:16:30] SPEAKER_00: It's good. I don't know what you're talking about. And that's a completely different conversation
[0:16:36] Unknown: than what's going to happen in like normal, polite society conversation, because it's oriented
[0:16:42] SPEAKER_00: around the past and the future. And things are problems and pain bodies are real. And you are
[0:16:46] SPEAKER_00: your thoughts. And like once all that stuff starts to shift, you need to feel like there are these
[0:16:52] SPEAKER_00: pockets of people who don't just think that you're going crazy. Yeah, yeah, I know. And also, I mean,
[0:17:00] SPEAKER_00: I remember even further back simple things like, you know, when someone, let's say, would complain
[0:17:05] SPEAKER_00: about someone and then you would give the other side like, well, maybe they're going through this,
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_00: you know, oh, we ever thought like the kind of thing that I just can't help but do reflexively
[0:17:15] SPEAKER_00: because of the way I'm wired is like, towards empathy and compassion and towards like trying
[0:17:19] SPEAKER_00: to understand human nature. And it's like, yeah, that's probably not what anyone wants to hear,
[0:17:24] SPEAKER_00: right? They want to hear you be like, they're such a dick. You know, I hate that. Right, of course.
[0:17:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And like, get incensed or whatever. Like even at one point at the party, some
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_00: wonder what happened at them. Oh, I know. Don't you have compassion for them? My heart just moves
[0:17:40] SPEAKER_00: towards compassion. Or like at one point, everyone was talking about what projects they were working
[0:17:45] SPEAKER_00: on. I'm not bitching about my friends, by the way, it was actually this super lovely time, of course.
[0:17:49] SPEAKER_00: But it was no me noticing that like, I'm a part of this lovely social event. And I'm noticing that I
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_00: just am not participating in the way that I have in the past, not in a shutdown, reckless way. It's
[0:18:04] SPEAKER_00: like, I just, I'm just noticing I feel really different. That's strange. Like it's like, at some
[0:18:10] SPEAKER_00: point, someone asked me, everyone was talking about their projects that they're working on. And
[0:18:14] SPEAKER_00: sweetly, like a friend, what are you working on right now? Because I know I'm a project person.
[0:18:18] Unknown: And I was like, I don't know. And I and I realized I can list things, of course, I can list things,
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_00: you know, like we're starting to be in human series, and I have one more interview with
[0:18:27] Unknown: liberated body, like I could list things. And I'm just like, I don't know. Is it okay, if I just
[0:18:32] SPEAKER_00: don't think it's that interesting, and I just don't want to talk about it right now. And they
[0:18:35] Unknown: were like, yes, because normally, I'm the project queen. Like the reason why they're asking me is
[0:18:42] SPEAKER_00: because they're my friend. Yeah, they're like, they know me, they know that I want to be like,
[0:18:46] SPEAKER_00: and then and then and then and I'm just like, I just don't think it's really interesting right
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_00: now. I'm sorry. Like I might think it's interesting tomorrow. But right now I'm just like, I don't know.
[0:18:55] Unknown: And it's helpful to, I don't know, have the other people on the alien planet that you can hang with.
[0:19:05] SPEAKER_00: Well, and I think you're describing something your friends sound very dear, because they're riding
[0:19:09] SPEAKER_00: all these waves with you. But it is true that certain less open people will try to hold you
[0:19:17] SPEAKER_00: back. Right? Sure. And I'm not going through that. I'm lucky. Yeah, yes. And there's a couple of
[0:19:22] SPEAKER_00: things people can confront. One is not meeting people that they can have these conversations
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_00: with. The other is that the people they are in relationship with start to try to hold you back.
[0:19:33] SPEAKER_00: So I've heard so many stories that shocked me, like, let's say someone becomes a vegan,
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_00: because all of a sudden, they realize that animal rights really matters to them.
[0:19:42] SPEAKER_00: And then people like tell them they're being a baby, or they should get over it, or they should
[0:19:47] Unknown: just eat this meat. I've heard people who are sober, tell me, like, people are like,
[0:19:53] SPEAKER_00: you should just have a drink. Like, I find that astonishing. Yeah, that that happens so much.
[0:19:59] SPEAKER_00: Or I don't know, maybe you're trying to like, eat clean and eat paleo. And someone's like,
[0:20:03] Unknown: you should live more and eat cake. Like, that kind of stuff is actually happening. And I can
[0:20:09] SPEAKER_00: only assume the same thing. Like people are like, I'm going to go on a meditation retreat. And it's
[0:20:13] SPEAKER_00: like, why don't you go on a vacation, have some fun. Your problem is you don't have enough fun
[0:20:17] Unknown: in life, right? Right. So there's one dilemma where you don't have anyone to talk to the about
[0:20:24] SPEAKER_00: these kinds of deep existential experiences. And then you have this other thing where there
[0:20:28] Unknown: might be someone in your life who's like, actively pushing against your evolving process,
[0:20:37] SPEAKER_00: right, which can then be really triggering of all those belief systems. I'm weird. It's not okay.
[0:20:44] SPEAKER_00: I'm not okay as I am. Why can't I just be quote unquote, normal? Yes. Oh, God. The mantra I've
[0:20:54] SPEAKER_00: said to myself since I was a child. Why can't I be normal? Why can't I be normal? Sometimes I say,
[0:20:59] Unknown: I don't know why, but why can't I be simpler? Like, and I don't know who's simple. You know,
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_00: that's the funny thing. Like if you had to really point out normal, it's like, I don't know who I'd
[0:21:10] Unknown: point out, but that's like the kind of thought process you have. So all that is to say is,
[0:21:17] SPEAKER_00: I guess one of the areas I have been lucky is, yeah, of course I have old friends who may not
[0:21:22] SPEAKER_00: want to converse about God and all these things to the same level that you and I do. But luckily
[0:21:28] SPEAKER_00: enough, I've had so many friends in my life where that is possible as you do too, right? You are
[0:21:33] Unknown: one point, but I have like a rich network of people that I could call up and have these deep
[0:21:39] SPEAKER_00: talks with. And I don't know if you and I realized when we started this show, like I know we wanted
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_00: to have conversations that we thought were meaningful, but did we realize when we started
[0:21:51] SPEAKER_00: how many people had no one to talk about? No, I think that that was really one of the surprises
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_00: and like all the feedback we get from people about how much it helps them to feel not alone,
[0:22:02] SPEAKER_00: which is like so great to hear, you know? Yeah, I hadn't realized like quite the extent of
[0:22:10] SPEAKER_00: difficulty that many of you were having and making connections with people who want to talk about
[0:22:17] Unknown: what matters to you. Yeah. Right. And who may also be committed to their own evolution, whatever we
[0:22:25] SPEAKER_00: call that, their own unfolding. And that can be really isolating. And so let's talk about the
[0:22:31] SPEAKER_00: sangha now. So the sangha is, okay, so if we just get like dorky for a second and talk about
[0:22:37] Unknown: Buddhism, just to put it into perspective, Buddha always said to people, you need the Buddha, the
[0:22:43] Unknown: Dharma, and he called it the noble sangha. And the Buddha was the teacher, right? And the teacher can
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_00: be Buddha, but it can be any teacher, any mentor, but it could even be a mountain in Buddhism, like
[0:23:00] SPEAKER_00: you can sit in front of Arunachala, they think is an enlightened being, it's just a mountain,
[0:23:04] SPEAKER_00: and like learn everything, but you need this being that you're learning with.
[0:23:11] Unknown: Then you have the Dharma, which is the teachings, right? So it's like the practices, the wisdom,
[0:23:16] SPEAKER_00: the understanding, the fingers pointing at the moon to help you find clarity, even though you
[0:23:22] SPEAKER_00: always had it, but somehow we can't see it and we need the finger pointing at the moon.
[0:23:26] SPEAKER_00: And then the last piece was the sangha, like this community of friends. So as it comes down,
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_00: at least the Buddhist lineages, it was like, you can't do it without these three things,
[0:23:38] SPEAKER_00: right? Like you need some being helping you because it's so easy to get lost in your own murky
[0:23:46] SPEAKER_00: pain body or psychology. You need some pointers, you need some guidance, you need some tools and
[0:23:52] SPEAKER_00: skills to kind of help you find that place of clarity within. And then the last thing is you
[0:23:57] Unknown: need support. You need to not be alone. And there's one other piece is you need people to hold you
[0:24:03] Unknown: accountable and to kind of hold that mirror up to you. So, I mean, geez, we've had some rich
[0:24:11] Unknown: sangha experiences lately, haven't we? Yes, we have. Yeah, yes, we have. It's interesting,
[0:24:23] SPEAKER_00: the mix that comes up. But as you were talking, I was thinking, like when you're saying people to
[0:24:26] SPEAKER_00: hold you accountable, and actually, I was talking with one of my dear friends this week, and
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_00: somebody who doesn't listen to the show, but who knows somebody who I do talk with about being on
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_00: the spiritual path, and who knows me quite well and knows that we do this. And she was like,
[0:24:40] Unknown: you're so lucky to have Vanessa. Like you're so lucky to have a friend that you can always call
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_00: up when you're in need or something like that. She put it like that. And I was like, I am.
[0:24:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm crazy lucky. And I also, you know, the other thing that's great that I have in Vanessa is that
[0:24:59] SPEAKER_00: she'll call me out when I'm full of shit. Like not in a harsh way, but like I remember when I was,
[0:25:05] SPEAKER_00: so I was in an abusive relationship, something I try and talk openly about,
[0:25:09] Unknown: which I got into when I was an adult, 35, 36, something like that. Anyway, and I'll never
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_00: forget the moment sitting across from you at brunch in Brooklyn towards the end of it. And you were
[0:25:21] SPEAKER_00: just like, it was so helpful. It was one of the most helpful moments of my whole life, because
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_00: instead of saying, oh, honey, I'm so sorry you're suffering so much. I'm so sorry you're hurt,
[0:25:30] SPEAKER_00: because I was just a train wreck. You were like, sweetheart, I've known you for a long time, and
[0:25:34] Unknown: you are not a crazy person. And in this relationship, you are being a crazy person.
[0:25:44] SPEAKER_00: And it was one of the most relieving things anyone has ever said to me, because it was holding my
[0:25:50] Unknown: feet to the fire. And that is like, if, if the path is about making friends with reality,
[0:25:57] Unknown: the Sangha is keeping you connected to reality, which is not the same as flinging feces in someone's
[0:26:05] SPEAKER_00: face. It is not the same as sharpening your knives and being harmful with it. It's just that when
[0:26:11] SPEAKER_00: there's an opening to really show somebody that they are being consumed by their stories of why
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_00: they need to be in this horrible situation, in my case, you can just offer them reality and be
[0:26:25] SPEAKER_00: reality and be like, I just need to show you, I know you're not crazy, and you're acting crazy.
[0:26:33] SPEAKER_00: So something's going on. And I after you said that, I said to you, I just want to go back
[0:26:40] Unknown: to being able to enjoy my life. And all you said was, yeah. And it was like, permission. I was like,
[0:26:48] SPEAKER_00: oh, I could just make that choice, you know, which of course, when you're in an abusive
[0:26:53] SPEAKER_00: relationship, that doesn't feel true, because you're fearing for your safety. And you've really
[0:26:57] SPEAKER_00: gotten yourself in quite a mess. When you're in something that deep, you've been listening to
[0:27:01] SPEAKER_00: some very loud pain bodies for a long time. But it was like, suddenly, there was just this breath
[0:27:05] Unknown: of fresh air of like, oh, like, there's permission for me to just engage with basic, sane reality,
[0:27:15] Unknown: which right now is at branch, sitting across from one of my dearest friends who I trust
[0:27:22] SPEAKER_00: with my life. And she's just offering up to me this reflection of like,
[0:27:29] SPEAKER_00: a way that wasn't going along with being hooked by the pain and the stories and the fear, terror,
[0:27:35] Unknown: just total terror when you're in a situation like that. That's what sangha is for too,
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_00: is not just like a place where you can go and feel all your feelings and be in catharsis and
[0:27:49] SPEAKER_00: kind of fall apart or alternatively, be the the super put together spiritual person who's got it
[0:27:55] SPEAKER_00: all figured out and really understands and oh, those people down there when they're at this point
[0:27:58] SPEAKER_00: on the path that I'm on, then they'll really see, you know, but somebody who's just engaging with
[0:28:03] Unknown: that, that real place in the middle of just reality right now. To have people like that with you on
[0:28:11] Unknown: the path, if and when you can find them is, I think the most precious resource we can have in
[0:28:18] Unknown: our lives. You're making me think about the difference between compassion and idiot compassion.
[0:28:25] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, girl. I still don't remember if we've talked about on this show. I don't know. I'm sure we've
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_00: talked about it in passing. We really should do a whole episode. Let's just say it again out loud.
[0:28:33] SPEAKER_00: I know. It's so critical. So it's a thing in Buddhism, they call it idiot compassion.
[0:28:41] SPEAKER_00: It's so kind, those Buddhists, but ultimately it is the kind of compassion where you're
[0:28:47] Unknown: sympathizing in a way that enables somebody, that enables their pain body, let's say.
[0:28:55] SPEAKER_00: Let's say I have a pain body that's like, I'm always victimized by life, like life doesn't
[0:29:01] SPEAKER_00: love me. And then if I was to talk to Brooke about it or life doesn't love me and like, you know,
[0:29:06] SPEAKER_00: I must have done something wrong. I'm never going to find someone, you know, whatever I think life
[0:29:10] SPEAKER_00: is withholding on me. And Brooke was to say, oh yes, you poor thing. I don't know why life is so
[0:29:15] SPEAKER_00: hard on you. Life really is so hard on you. That always happens, right? That that kind of
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_00: compassion is actually just stoking the fire of my pathology. It's like feeding my pain body,
[0:29:27] SPEAKER_00: you know, where it's enabling me. Like, let's say I'm like, could you loan me money so I can go on
[0:29:32] SPEAKER_00: that bender that I've been dying to go on? You should have some fun. Right. You all get,
[0:29:37] SPEAKER_00: you get the point that there's a way that can compassion can slip into a pattern of enabling
[0:29:45] SPEAKER_00: something that's actually painful for someone. And in Buddhism, they'll talk about the opposite,
[0:29:50] SPEAKER_00: which is the sword of prajna, which is this other kind of compassion besides the beautiful sitting
[0:29:57] SPEAKER_00: and holding of one's experiences and Oh, Brooke, yes, tell me more. There's this other level that's
[0:30:02] SPEAKER_00: like the cutting through of illusion, which is like, Oh, no, this isn't real, darling, dear. Oh,
[0:30:08] SPEAKER_00: no, that's not you see, see there, see where you're going. No, that's not the path. Right.
[0:30:14] SPEAKER_00: And I feel like sometimes in our friendships, like in the modern world, we could have people
[0:30:20] SPEAKER_00: who are either really good at idiot compassion. Like that's what I was saying before, like,
[0:30:24] SPEAKER_00: Oh, you're right. He's such a dick. Like, yeah, I know. Oh, my God. I can't believe that happened.
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_00: It's like drama and gossip is a big way you see that one. Yeah. So there's like that, or people
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_00: can be honest, but like so hurtful and not necessarily helpful. Like there's this honesty
[0:30:42] SPEAKER_00: that serves and then there's this honesty that's just like, I don't know, pushing at someone's
[0:30:47] SPEAKER_00: buttons. I don't even know how to describe it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So in the sangha, this
[0:30:54] SPEAKER_00: is what you're meant to get is that there's people who are capable of genuine compassion, which
[0:31:00] SPEAKER_00: we could say in this circumstance means aligning with who you are, like aligning with who you
[0:31:05] SPEAKER_00: really are, your whole self and like holding the view for you when you can't hold the view.
[0:31:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's a really good way of putting it because I think that's critically it like,
[0:31:17] Unknown: you just have a much broader support net than just yourself and your own thoughts. And you know,
[0:31:23] SPEAKER_00: what's that quote? Like the mind is a scary place. Don't go in there alone. Well, you know,
[0:31:29] Unknown: the view. Okay, so a little bit ago, I'm hooked in a pain body. And I know for a fact, like I've
[0:31:38] Unknown: talked about pain bodies with people before. Okay, let me give you a really too intimate example
[0:31:45] SPEAKER_00: for my life. But I was doing, I'm not going to give it all the details. I just talked about
[0:31:49] SPEAKER_00: relationship, but it's in the past. It's very cozy back there. This is still in the past. No,
[0:31:54] SPEAKER_00: this is in the past, but it was not. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Well, okay. Here's what was
[0:32:00] SPEAKER_00: happening. I was, I was in the middle of a relationship ending and it had been dying on
[0:32:04] SPEAKER_00: the vine. I talked about this relationship a little bit on the show and it was dying on the
[0:32:08] Unknown: vine, but Vanessa was hooked. Like I did not want to let go boy. Like I was grabby hands times 10
[0:32:18] SPEAKER_00: with this thing, right? But I knew it had to end. I had this very clear forethought
[0:32:23] SPEAKER_00: and towards the, the die, like it was gasping. I mean, it was in its dying breaths and I'm clinging
[0:32:28] SPEAKER_00: to it, but I know better. And in the end, I reconnect with my husband, Mario. And like,
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_00: you know, we're friends. We were long time friends and we reconnect and we're friends.
[0:32:40] Unknown: I don't cheat on my boyfriend or anything, but we're flirting, right? And I know that's not right.
[0:32:46] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I know very clearly that's not right and flirting and it's nothing dramatic. And pretty
[0:32:51] Unknown: quickly, I just break up with my boyfriend, right? But in that phase where I was flirting with Mario,
[0:32:58] SPEAKER_00: which I did apologize to this man, this man knows. So God forbid someone's listening.
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_00: I'm clear, but as if he's like really listening to bliss and grit, but he might, you never know.
[0:33:09] Unknown: So in that moment, when I was flirting, so many of my friends were like, well, don't worry about it.
[0:33:17] SPEAKER_00: You're doing your best. It's not like you cheated on him. Like, you know, you're, and that was nice.
[0:33:24] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's nice. Like I was strangely enough doing my best, which sounds really shitty, but
[0:33:29] SPEAKER_00: there was something about that relationship that had me so like turned upside down that it really
[0:33:33] SPEAKER_00: was the best I could do to get myself out of the relationship. However, my ex-husband, Frank, who's
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_00: my dear friend, who you've all heard me talk about was like, you're doing a shitty thing.
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_00: Frank is good with the sword of prajna. Oh, great. And he's like, and you're going to feel shitty
[0:33:51] SPEAKER_00: about it. And I was like, you know what, Frank? I know it. I know I'm doing a shitty thing and I
[0:33:58] SPEAKER_00: know I'm going to feel shitty about it. I know it. And I'm just going to do the best I can to kind of
[0:34:02] Unknown: like deal with this. But I thought like, thank you because I was, I was, I knew that that was my truth.
[0:34:11] SPEAKER_00: It was my truth. And so even though my friends were being so kind and so loving and it had its own
[0:34:16] SPEAKER_00: kernel of truth, it's like, it felt so much better to just have my truth validated.
[0:34:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, truth is relieving. Like that's the same.
[0:34:24] SPEAKER_00: It's very relieving. I was like, I know I'm doing this shitty thing. And then like that got to stay
[0:34:30] SPEAKER_00: in my mind. So later, like my, you know, my boyfriend and I broke up pretty close after that. And then
[0:34:36] SPEAKER_00: later I went to him and I, and I talked to him about it and I apologized. I actually did ho'oponopono
[0:34:41] SPEAKER_00: and I did this beautiful thing. I wrote him a letter and I apologized. And it was like,
[0:34:45] SPEAKER_00: Frank's words had kind of stayed in the background and like supported me because I was scared to do
[0:34:50] SPEAKER_00: that. Right. And so when you're afraid, it would be easy for me to have bought my own delusion that
[0:34:56] SPEAKER_00: my other friends were selling me. That's like, well, I didn't do, I mean, actually I'm kind of great.
[0:35:00] SPEAKER_00: I didn't cheat on him. It was ending anyway, but like, you know, there's something chasing at you.
[0:35:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Like he didn't treat me right. Like I could have gone into any kind of rationalization,
[0:35:12] SPEAKER_00: even though I knew what was true and what was true was what was true. And I knew what felt right.
[0:35:17] SPEAKER_00: Like what felt like ease or rightness to me was like, I was doing something wrong. I should own
[0:35:23] SPEAKER_00: it and I have to be clear and I have to apologize and like clear the decks for this man. And Frank's
[0:35:28] Unknown: words helped me do that. Cause I felt like I could always hold on to that if I wanted to pop into a
[0:35:35] SPEAKER_00: delusion. Like, no, you did a shitty thing and you knew you were going to feel shitty.
[0:35:40] SPEAKER_00: Now let's go, let's deal with it. And I think that's what a Sangha does. So whether or not you have
[0:35:48] SPEAKER_00: like a formal community, which we have a couple of formal communities, but none of them always
[0:35:52] SPEAKER_00: in touch with you have one that you're in touch with more than me probably, but, or it's just this
[0:35:59] SPEAKER_00: special group of friends that are different. Like I go to my friends if I'm upset, all of my friends
[0:36:05] SPEAKER_00: are really good human beings, but you know who you're going to go to when you have a Sangha problem.
[0:36:11] SPEAKER_00: Right. And who's going to deliver reality to you? Like who's capable? Like who's had enough
[0:36:18] SPEAKER_00: practice hours logged with reality that they're going to be able to deliver that in that moment.
[0:36:25] SPEAKER_00: Yes. Cause that kind of shit is like pretty scary. So let's talk about real Sanghas and like
[0:36:31] SPEAKER_00: experience with real Sanghas. Because, yeah, we should, you know, like, oh, all right. So one
[0:36:35] SPEAKER_00: thing I'll say is a lot of times when they talk to clients, unfortunately it's not uncommon that
[0:36:41] SPEAKER_00: people are humans are lonely these days, at least in the modern culture. It's a lonely world right
[0:36:47] SPEAKER_00: now. It's a very lonely world. So A people are lonely. Now B if you're an introvert or a sensi
[0:36:52] SPEAKER_00: or a spiritual seeker, you know, or a medium, a clairvoyant, any of these things, and you haven't
[0:36:58] SPEAKER_00: yet felt comfortable owning them. Now that can like double your opportunity for loneliness. Right. So
[0:37:06] SPEAKER_00: a lot of times I'll say to people, and I've seen this in clients, like consistently you're swimming
[0:37:11] SPEAKER_00: in the wrong pond. Like you just need to get up and get into a different pond, whatever that means,
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_00: go to a meditation studio, do a yoga teacher training, if that's what's calling you,
[0:37:23] SPEAKER_00: move to a different city. Like Austin and Miami are very different in terms of how they're making
[0:37:29] SPEAKER_00: space for the type of person I am. Right. Like you need to get into a different pond because
[0:37:35] SPEAKER_00: yes, of course, when you're alone all of the time and you're in your own head and the people you do
[0:37:40] SPEAKER_00: try to talk to either rebuff you or they lack interest in what you're talking about, it's going
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_00: to keep all those pain bodies circulating. It's like trigger, trigger, trigger, trigger.
[0:37:48] SPEAKER_00: And I would say the mask you're wearing, like the not being out of the closet is just making you be
[0:37:54] Unknown: around people. You know, like if I only am like, or those stupid dating advice things, right? Like
[0:38:02] SPEAKER_00: if I followed the rules and went on dates and acted like, I don't know, a vapid princess or
[0:38:07] SPEAKER_00: whatever the advice is that they give, like I would attract people who like vapid princesses
[0:38:11] SPEAKER_00: and I would hate them. So it's like the same thing with the people in your community. If you
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: just feel really lonely and no one can connect with you, probably there's some part of you that
[0:38:19] SPEAKER_00: you're really not letting come forward enough that there's that people are going to glimpse
[0:38:24] SPEAKER_00: the truth of you and go, Ooh, and even have an opportunity to be attracted to that and to
[0:38:29] SPEAKER_00: resonate with that in a way where you can find truth buddies. Yeah. If you go, you're hiding out
[0:38:36] SPEAKER_00: too much, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, some of it can come from how much you let show
[0:38:41] SPEAKER_00: so that you're like a beacon, right? Like you just let that show to this guy that you're already
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_00: friends with, but like now you have a whole new area to go into and you never know, right? When
[0:38:51] SPEAKER_00: you have the courage, you never know what's on the other side. Like I believe people are a lot more
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_00: curious about spirituality than we fear they are when we're stuck in that closet feeling.
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_00: But then the second thing is sometimes you just need to go to places where people who think like
[0:39:08] Unknown: this or feel like this or interested in this exist. Yeah. Right. And that's what a Buddhist
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_00: sangha was. I mean, I think they have sanghas and in yogic traditions too. I think actually it's the
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_00: same word. It's a sangha and they existed because spiritual seekers were not always part of the
[0:39:29] SPEAKER_00: mainstream culture. I think at any time per se. Yeah. Right. And they would go and join
[0:39:35] Unknown: another group. I mean, church, if you are Catholic, temple, mosque, these places are
[0:39:44] SPEAKER_00: sanghas for different traditions, right? They're communities of people who come together,
[0:39:50] SPEAKER_00: who are meant to elevate one another, support one another and kind of hold each other on the path.
[0:39:56] SPEAKER_00: Would you agree? Yeah. I think that's idealistically what they're designed for. I think
[0:40:01] SPEAKER_00: that's why they came into being. Yes. Yeah. That was the original goal. So we can see kind of
[0:40:07] SPEAKER_00: cross-culturally there was this calling for, it's hard to do this alone. When you look at a desk
[0:40:14] SPEAKER_00: and you knock on wood, you believe that's wood, right? And if everybody else in the world believes
[0:40:21] SPEAKER_00: that's wood and all of a sudden you're like Judith Blackstone, you start to see it's light,
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_00: but everyone around you is going, no, it's wood. No, it's wood. No, it's wood. It's definitely
[0:40:28] SPEAKER_00: wood. Like I can feel Judith being so mad at you for saying, Hey, she should have shared it in her
[0:40:34] Unknown: book that she saw light. That's true. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. I'm not calling her out.
[0:40:42] Unknown: Yeah. I mean, you know, then it's hard to get out of your own. It's hard to get out of the collective
[0:40:51] SPEAKER_00: view of reality. Yeah. If you don't have a group of people who are like, yeah, I kind of get where
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_00: you're going. Oh, I see where you're going. Oh, I don't know, but I believe it. You know? Yes,
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_00: absolutely. Or even just like one person or, or yeah, or whatever. Yeah. One person is a great
[0:41:06] Unknown: start. It is a fantastic start. It's so handy. And then, you know, I think that the piece that
[0:41:12] Unknown: we should probably talk about a little bit is that when you do say, go to a Sangha, like an actual
[0:41:20] SPEAKER_00: place, a meeting for people, or even if it's like a power of now book club or whatever,
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_00: you've decided you're going to kind of immerse yourself more in spiritual people, like you're
[0:41:28] Unknown: going to find humans. When you go there, you're going to find human beings, and human beings come
[0:41:34] SPEAKER_00: with all of their stuff and all of their flavors and all of their triggers. And so you're not going
[0:41:40] SPEAKER_00: to automatically resonate with everyone. There will be people there who piss you off and push
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_00: your buttons, at least historically for me, that has been the case. And, and you don't have to give
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_00: yourself over to them. You know what I mean? Like, it's not like joining a cult. It's not like, okay,
[0:41:55] SPEAKER_00: but this is my Sangha. And so I need to share everything that's like the most close to the
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_00: bone for me right now with all of these people in the room. Like I would say, you know, not
[0:42:06] SPEAKER_00: necessarily. It's an opportunity to connect in a very genuine way with people on the path. And then
[0:42:11] SPEAKER_00: when you get there, you'll discover, like, who are the people who you really do resonate with?
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_00: And who are the people who you don't? And like, great. So now you have some people who you
[0:42:22] Unknown: resonate with, as opposed to none or very few. So there's still, you know, discernment comes into
[0:42:28] SPEAKER_00: play, and there's still humans being humans everywhere you go. Well, and then you have the
[0:42:32] SPEAKER_00: second part, I mean, because part of the Sangha is to mirror to you where you're still hooked.
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_00: Oh, well, everything's a chance to just push on the wounds, get everything up through the soil.
[0:42:45] SPEAKER_00: Community so potentially overwhelming to people. I mean, historically, I've always been the person,
[0:42:52] SPEAKER_00: and I say historically as in, you know, as of yesterday,
[0:42:59] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to box myself in. But no, historically, I'm always the person like,
[0:43:04] SPEAKER_00: okay, so when I went to grad school in San Francisco, it's coming from New York. And before
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_00: we go to class, because I went to a spiritual psychology program, you had like a retreat,
[0:43:15] SPEAKER_00: like a kind of meditation, he touchy feely retreat. And they're like, okay, who wants to carpool?
[0:43:21] SPEAKER_00: They're like, there's a carpool board where strangers are shining up. And it's like a three
[0:43:26] SPEAKER_00: hour drive. Oh, hell no, I'll take the room by myself. And definitely not carpooling. God forbid,
[0:43:32] Unknown: I get stuck with some stranger for three hours, right? Like, that is me at every community thing.
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_00: And then the funny thing is I do this at every community thing. And then I'm like, no one's
[0:43:43] Unknown: talking. I know. I've seen you do it a million times. No, but this time, I was trying so hard.
[0:43:51] SPEAKER_00: No, yeah, no, you were good. I was thinking about Dharma Ocean. Like I remember it. So Dharma Ocean
[0:43:56] SPEAKER_00: at the end of a week of retreat, you have a what they call the banquet, which is a big party,
[0:44:00] SPEAKER_00: you know, and you guys have been through a lot together. And you've also been through days of
[0:44:03] Unknown: silence. So there's this like very bubbly, lively uplifted feeling, which is quite delightful.
[0:44:08] SPEAKER_00: And I remember walking in with you, I was your Zongo wingman. And at some point, I was talking
[0:44:15] SPEAKER_00: with another friend of ours, Annika, who we met through Dharma Ocean and hi Annika. And I saw you
[0:44:22] SPEAKER_00: across the room or something. And like you gave me some like signal, like a little bit of a like,
[0:44:27] Unknown: help me a little bit. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I should go see how this is doing. Sometimes she
[0:44:35] SPEAKER_00: hates these community things when they first get started or something, because it was Annika. So
[0:44:39] SPEAKER_00: I feel like I could say that. And she was like, really, she seems so extroverted and so like
[0:44:43] SPEAKER_00: comfortable in her skin. I was like, I know everyone always says the same thing. And she
[0:44:47] Unknown: always does the same thing. I'll be right back. Yeah. And really, she's a sensitive extrovert with
[0:44:53] SPEAKER_00: people issues. And so this is what happens to me every time. I really like Dharma Ocean
[0:44:59] SPEAKER_00: Sangha because you're silent. And so it's delightful. Right. And you know, and then it's a
[0:45:04] SPEAKER_00: party. And then it's a party and I get to be with people. But I don't have any of my belief systems
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_00: getting stirred quite the same way. Although a lot of people when they're silent do have their
[0:45:14] SPEAKER_00: belief systems stirred still. That's just not what was like, yeah, some people. Yeah, have a
[0:45:19] SPEAKER_00: very hard time with silence. I think you and I feel very comfortable in silence.
[0:45:23] SPEAKER_00: Very comfortable. So it's like, Oh, I'm with everybody. And I could just love everybody
[0:45:26] Unknown: because there's not a single button being pushed. Anyway, the moral of that story was that
[0:45:33] Unknown: the community becomes a mirror for me, right? To see where I'm afraid, where I think, you know,
[0:45:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm too much, where I think I'm not enough, where I take on responsibility for people's feelings,
[0:45:45] Unknown: right? So that, you know, I've said it before on the on the show that group therapy was like,
[0:45:51] Unknown: you know, such a helpful thing to do. Because the only way I knew how to perceive myself was
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: inside of myself inside of myself, I feel like a very shy person. In a group, I'm getting a lot
[0:46:04] SPEAKER_00: different feedback. I mean, it's changed over the years dramatically. But but still, you know,
[0:46:09] SPEAKER_00: you're going to get something different. It's like what happened to the man in our group at the at
[0:46:14] Unknown: our facilitator training, you know, it's like, he sees himself different inside than how we were
[0:46:20] Unknown: experiencing him, right? He must I know he does. And so then what happens is, the song was a place
[0:46:29] SPEAKER_00: and a contained place, because there are facilitators, and there are certain codes that
[0:46:34] SPEAKER_00: we're all going to follow. So it was a really contained and gentle place for him to start to
[0:46:40] Unknown: see something he couldn't see. Yeah. And it's an invitation, at least, at the at the very least,
[0:46:47] Unknown: yes, it's an invitation. Because imagine, most of us want more connection, you know, even in this
[0:46:53] SPEAKER_00: conversation, we want genuine connection. I mean, that's what a song is there for. We want people
[0:46:58] SPEAKER_00: who really see us and, you know, point point shit out to us if they have to like they they love us
[0:47:04] SPEAKER_00: enough, they have to do that, right. And so we want that kind of deep connection. And a lot of
[0:47:10] SPEAKER_00: times, because of our own wounding in life, our own pain, our own psychology, we ourselves are
[0:47:16] SPEAKER_00: thwarting ourselves from having that connection. Just like the story I told you, I mean, what do
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_00: you think Vanessa wants? Like, she wants connection, supposed to be loved as she is, right? It's like,
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_00: I'm no different than any human. But if I show up, and I won't sign up for any activities, and I
[0:47:31] SPEAKER_00: won't really talk to anyone, like not more than one person at a time. And, you know, I have a room
[0:47:35] Unknown: to myself, because I'm too cool to stay in the dorms. They're getting a different experience than
[0:47:42] SPEAKER_00: that. And then here I am, I could just as easily go home and be like, Well, I don't know what was
[0:47:47] SPEAKER_00: the matter with me, I knew there was something the matter, no one talked to me, right. And I
[0:47:52] SPEAKER_00: could stay spiraling in my own painful belief systems and not realize the way that my wounds
[0:47:58] SPEAKER_00: or my pain bodies are having me engage in relationship. It's like wounds were formed
[0:48:04] SPEAKER_00: in relationship. So wounds are acted out in relationship, right? Right. They can be acted
[0:48:11] SPEAKER_00: out on your cushion. But usually they're acted out in relationship. So the sangha becomes this
[0:48:17] SPEAKER_00: really rich place that I, I love and I hate and I push and I pull because you'll find,
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_00: oh, I mean, everyone will, everyone will find some really sweet support. The combo platter,
[0:48:31] Unknown: but everything comes together. Yeah. It's like in the washing machine. And there's like, you know,
[0:48:37] SPEAKER_00: no, no stop button. But without them, I guess it is to say that without people with you, as you're
[0:48:46] SPEAKER_00: in this journey of life and on this path and looking at what matters to you, without people
[0:48:50] SPEAKER_00: with you, not only can you feel very alone and sort of confused and lost sometimes, because
[0:48:58] SPEAKER_00: like if I get lost and I'm like, God broke this pain body so bad, you're like, hey, here's the way
[0:49:03] SPEAKER_00: that's just a pain body. And you can point, right? Yeah. So you can hold it when I can't. And that's
[0:49:10] Unknown: huge. So it's all of that. And then it's also a great place to see how you're engaging with life
[0:49:19] SPEAKER_00: that might be keeping some of the things that you don't want anymore running. Yeah. And then
[0:49:24] SPEAKER_00: you have a chance to have different thoughts and different experiences and life starts to show up
[0:49:29] Unknown: quite differently. So how many of these they don't run? Yeah, the Sangha doesn't run, right?
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_00: They can't ditch you. Yeah, it's very helpful. Like, and you can say the really,
[0:49:42] SPEAKER_00: whatever the really true, really raw, at some points, things might be coming up and they don't
[0:49:47] Unknown: go anywhere. Like I remember when I was on retreat with Kieran last fall, and I met my friend
[0:49:53] SPEAKER_00: Christina, who's local to me now. So she and I talk, you know, somewhat regularly. But
[0:49:59] SPEAKER_00: at some point, it just came up that feeling in the solar plexus of waking up in the morning,
[0:50:03] Unknown: oh my God, I'm going to die. And she was like, oh, yeah, just cash, right? Like, I can say this to
[0:50:10] SPEAKER_00: this person who I've just met, because she's in my Sangha now, because we're on retreat, we know
[0:50:14] SPEAKER_00: we're here committed to truth. And also, I can just feel that I resonate with her and I can trust
[0:50:19] SPEAKER_00: her and she's a really genuine human being. And I can say that it was so helpful because she was
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_00: like, oh my God, I remember that for years. I remember that for years. And she was like,
[0:50:26] SPEAKER_00: it's just, you know, don't don't buy it. It's just the ego realizing that it, you know,
[0:50:31] SPEAKER_00: it's losing ground. And like, I've heard that in spiritual teachings other places, but there was
[0:50:36] SPEAKER_00: something about this moment, like I'm gathered and with the Sangha, I offer this piece of something
[0:50:41] SPEAKER_00: that's really challenging to me, has been really challenging to me. And this person come and it
[0:50:46] SPEAKER_00: just I was like, oh, God, that's so true. Like, it's just anxiety. It's just a physical feeling
[0:50:51] Unknown: I wake up with. It's not true. It's just fear wearing a different hat, you know. That's when
[0:50:58] SPEAKER_00: Sangha is like, ah, so relieving. This isn't somebody who I had, you know, 20 years of friendship
[0:51:04] Unknown: with. We met on a long weekend. But yeah, in the Sangha. And there is a container set. I mean,
[0:51:11] SPEAKER_00: anywhere that you go. And generally, the people who are attracted to these kinds of things,
[0:51:16] SPEAKER_00: right, especially if it's a good teacher, but they'll set the container. So it may feel like
[0:51:21] SPEAKER_00: a risk to kind of come out and say something like that or say anything else that might be on your
[0:51:26] SPEAKER_00: mind. But the container is set like no one's going to ridicule you. No one can turn away. They can't
[0:51:33] Unknown: just leave, you know, like, there's this kind of built in safety. And everyone's going for the same
[0:51:40] Unknown: thing, which is to find truth and to find connection to themselves to life to others. So it's like,
[0:51:47] SPEAKER_00: everyone wants that same kindness. So people are so ready to give it even if in a different
[0:51:53] SPEAKER_00: circumstance. They're not that way. Yeah, I always find like, in in conscious gatherings,
[0:51:59] Unknown: this aspect of people come through. So I don't know what's moral of the story. Go find a Sangha.
[0:52:07] Unknown: Okay, moral of the story. You're not alone. You're not alone. There are all these really great places
[0:52:14] SPEAKER_00: where you can go and just start putting out your own little feelers about what feels like it
[0:52:18] SPEAKER_00: resonates to you. And you know, if I can also end with a hope, or something I'm grateful for, like I
[0:52:24] SPEAKER_00: really didn't anticipate when we started doing the show that people would listen to these and feel
[0:52:27] SPEAKER_00: not alone and feel supported. And so I hope that continues. And I also hope that we can find ways to
[0:52:36] SPEAKER_00: you know, have people connected more and more because it is it's just so relieving.
[0:52:40] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's amazing the power of a conversation. It can't be undermined. No.
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_00: Thank you so much for listening to today's show. The show notes including any of the resources

[0:53:49] SPEAKER_00: is I like you better than Nico K's, which is great. Here's the review. This podcast is turning
[0:53:55] SPEAKER_00: out to be very important to me. I often listen multiple times to an episode and reference it
[0:54:00] SPEAKER_00: almost comically regularly in meaningful conversation. These two very smart, curious
[0:54:06] SPEAKER_00: and well studied people complement each other beautifully in straightforward, honest conversations
[0:54:11] SPEAKER_00: about the mysteries of being human. It feels like finding friends in the dark amidst all our
[0:54:16] SPEAKER_00: stumbling and searching and getting a leg up on the journey. Thanks for doing your work,
[0:54:21] SPEAKER_00: Brooke and Vanessa, and especially for sharing it so openly. You speak to my soul and I'm grateful.
[0:54:26] SPEAKER_00: That review makes me tear up a little bit. It's very sweet. And I can't even tell you guys how
[0:54:31] SPEAKER_00: much it means to us to know that you're all out there and that this work is meaningful and that
[0:54:36] SPEAKER_00: we're not just being goofy, vulnerable people in a vacuum, and that it's actually helpful in the
[0:54:44] SPEAKER_00: world. So thank you so much and we'll be back next week.
