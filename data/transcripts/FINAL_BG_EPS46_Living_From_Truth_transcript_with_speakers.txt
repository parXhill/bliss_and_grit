[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls.
[0:00:08] SPEAKER_01: You're listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:09] SPEAKER_01: I'm Brooke Thomas and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto.
[0:00:15] SPEAKER_01: On the show, we are talking about being on the embodied spiritual path and what does
[0:00:19] SPEAKER_01: that even mean?
[0:00:20] SPEAKER_01: So, what is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:24] SPEAKER_01: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:26] SPEAKER_01: And whether you're new to the show or if you've been listening along for a while, just a note
[0:00:36] SPEAKER_01: about the frame here.
[0:00:38] SPEAKER_01: So, we're not putting these conversations forward as the word.
[0:00:41] SPEAKER_01: We certainly do not think of ourselves as gurus.
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_01: We're really just a couple of regular old humans sharing our personal experiences as
[0:00:48] SPEAKER_01: we follow our paths.
[0:00:49] SPEAKER_01: So, if that sounds fun and useful for you, then come play.
[0:00:55] SPEAKER_01: In today's episode, we are talking about a recent weekend we got to spend together in
[0:00:59] SPEAKER_01: Ithaca going to an event Adyashanti was having there.
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_01: So, that was actually our first time for both of us to be with Adyashanti.
[0:01:08] SPEAKER_01: We do a general download on what it was like to be with him and what we got out of the
[0:01:12] SPEAKER_01: weekend, but more specifically, we dial into his lens on what it means to trust your life,
[0:01:19] SPEAKER_01: which is a thread that runs through all of the teachers that Vanessa and I love.
[0:01:24] SPEAKER_01: And really, it's the heart of this path.
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_01: So, in so many ways, you could say that it is the journey that we're making here.
[0:01:30] SPEAKER_01: And Adyashanti also talked about how, in many ways, awakening is you becoming the most you,
[0:01:36] SPEAKER_01: which seems paradoxical because a lot of people talk about it being you disappearing.
[0:01:42] SPEAKER_01: So, on the path, we wind up recognizing how often we're in conflict both with who we are,
[0:01:48] SPEAKER_01: really who we are, underneath all the conditioning, and also with what is showing up in our lives.
[0:01:54] SPEAKER_01: So, what are some of the complexities of that?
[0:01:56] SPEAKER_01: What are some of the complexities of how we turn away from the truth?
[0:01:59] SPEAKER_01: And another one of my very favorite topics of conversation, how is the body our most
[0:02:06] SPEAKER_01: accurate truth-sensing device?
[0:02:09] SPEAKER_01: If you're enjoying the show, we would be thrilled if you left a review for us.
[0:02:12] SPEAKER_01: You can do that on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit.
[0:02:16] SPEAKER_01: And you can also head over to blissandgrit.com and subscribe if you want to hear updates
[0:02:19] SPEAKER_01: on any things we might have percolating in the future.
[0:02:23] SPEAKER_01: And the very last thing before we head into the conversation, Vanessa and I do curse,
[0:02:27] SPEAKER_01: swear, have potty mouths.
[0:02:29] SPEAKER_01: So, if you're in mixed non-sweary company, you might want to wear some headphones.
[0:02:33] Unknown: Okay, here we go.
[0:02:38] SPEAKER_01: Hello, everyone.
[0:02:39] SPEAKER_01: This is Brooke.
[0:02:41] SPEAKER_01: And this is Vanessa.
[0:02:42] SPEAKER_01: And we are actually sitting in the same room at the same time recording.
[0:02:47] SPEAKER_01: It's so amazing.
[0:02:48] SPEAKER_01: So, we are here together in Ithaca.
[0:02:51] SPEAKER_01: The audio might sound different because we're not over Skype.
[0:02:54] SPEAKER_01: Maybe it'll be better.
[0:02:55] SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
[0:02:56] SPEAKER_01: We'll find out.
[0:02:57] SPEAKER_01: But we're in Ithaca because we're here for an Adyashanti weekend, which has been totally
[0:03:03] SPEAKER_01: delightful.
[0:03:04] SPEAKER_01: We're actually about to head into day two of that.
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_01: And Adyashanti is a teacher, if you don't know that.
[0:03:10] SPEAKER_01: If that's an unfamiliar word for you.
[0:03:12] SPEAKER_01: Certainly linked to him in the show notes.
[0:03:13] SPEAKER_01: He's somebody who is a very, very clear, very sane, very ordinary, ordinary in the most
[0:03:23] Unknown: wonderful way teacher.
[0:03:26] SPEAKER_01: So, Vanessa and I have both read a number of his books and listened to his recordings.
[0:03:30] Unknown: And this is our first time for both of us to be actually in his presence.
[0:03:35] SPEAKER_01: And we're not doing like a big old week-long retreat or anything, but we are doing this
[0:03:38] SPEAKER_01: nice weekend satsang basically where there's a little bit of time meditating, but also
[0:03:42] Unknown: some time with him giving talks.
[0:03:46] SPEAKER_01: And then people have a chance to ask questions about things that are up for them in their
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_01: lives.
[0:03:50] Unknown: So, basically, we're going to freestyle it and go through some of the things that came
[0:03:55] SPEAKER_01: up for us yesterday and some of the things we're finding interesting.
[0:04:00] SPEAKER_01: And of course, I think for both of us, it's just totally delightful to see how many times
[0:04:07] Unknown: of different teachers, the same thing gets mentioned, the same essence of what is this
[0:04:14] SPEAKER_01: thing that we're doing?
[0:04:15] SPEAKER_01: What is the path?
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_01: What is being on a spiritual path?
[0:04:19] SPEAKER_01: Which also includes some of what is it not?
[0:04:21] SPEAKER_01: Because I think there's a lot of weird ideas out there about what it is.
[0:04:26] SPEAKER_01: So, I don't know, maybe we just scroll through some notes from yesterday and freestyle.
[0:04:31] SPEAKER_01: It turns out sitting across from you is a lot more trippy.
[0:04:34] SPEAKER_01: I know, it's weird actually being in the same room.
[0:04:37] SPEAKER_01: I keep looking at the computer like you're there, but you're here.
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_01: And I'm actually tripping out a little bit when I look at you.
[0:04:43] SPEAKER_01: So, let's see if I can't concentrate.
[0:04:45] SPEAKER_01: I want to add to what you were just saying how cool it is to be in the presence of a
[0:04:50] SPEAKER_01: teacher.
[0:04:51] SPEAKER_01: It does just occur to me.
[0:04:52] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's funny what you get from these experiences, intensives, retreats, sanghas.
[0:04:59] SPEAKER_01: So there's the content, which I'm going to scroll through and sort of highlight some
[0:05:03] SPEAKER_01: of the things that I found really fascinating and we'll talk about them.
[0:05:07] SPEAKER_01: So, there's the content level.
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_01: But then there's also just the experience level of what it's like to be in the presence
[0:05:15] SPEAKER_01: of someone.
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_01: And it's amazing how much that non-verbal level is the alchemical agent.
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's like the words have this really beautiful way of sometimes popping something
[0:05:27] Unknown: open in you.
[0:05:30] SPEAKER_01: Words do have power, but so much of it is in the experience.
[0:05:35] SPEAKER_01: And that's the hard part to name.
[0:05:38] SPEAKER_01: Because I've read Adi Ashanti's work before.
[0:05:40] SPEAKER_01: I read Falling into Grace.
[0:05:41] SPEAKER_01: I thought it was lovely.
[0:05:42] SPEAKER_01: I actually was never entranced by it though.
[0:05:46] SPEAKER_01: It was like, oh, this is really lovely.
[0:05:47] SPEAKER_01: This is interesting.
[0:05:49] SPEAKER_01: The end of your world I found a little more fascinating.
[0:05:51] SPEAKER_01: I think some of it is just in the ripeness of when you're ready for these things.
[0:05:57] Unknown: But sitting in his presence and feeling his sanity and his joy and his ease and his simplicity
[0:06:07] SPEAKER_01: had this kind of medicinal quality for me of like untangling some of the things in my
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_01: brain that were complicating things.
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_01: Like, oh, if I didn't rest in my ego and all of my belief systems, that's a very scary
[0:06:21] SPEAKER_01: death, right?
[0:06:22] SPEAKER_01: Like, oh, that's so scary.
[0:06:24] SPEAKER_01: I can't let go of control.
[0:06:26] SPEAKER_01: And if you don't function at the level at which you believe you have to in this world
[0:06:32] SPEAKER_01: in order to be also successful and feed yourself and have relationships, then there's some
[0:06:38] SPEAKER_01: falling apart process.
[0:06:41] SPEAKER_01: Maybe I picture something like Ram Dass's guru who was this really evolved human being
[0:06:46] SPEAKER_01: but maybe couldn't feed himself so well.
[0:06:50] SPEAKER_01: And I'm not 100% sure that that was true for Ram Dass's guru.
[0:06:55] SPEAKER_01: There are plenty of Indian saints that were like that, but please don't quote me on that
[0:06:59] SPEAKER_01: part.
[0:07:00] SPEAKER_01: But it's like that's maybe in the background of my imagination.
[0:07:03] SPEAKER_01: So just sitting in the room with Adi Ashanti, who's just normal, quote unquote.
[0:07:10] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he's wearing his little plaid button down and loafers and he doesn't have any pomp
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_01: and circumstance about arriving in the room.
[0:07:17] SPEAKER_01: He's really just like a guy.
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he walks in real softly.
[0:07:21] SPEAKER_01: He cracks jokes.
[0:07:22] SPEAKER_01: He's really easy.
[0:07:25] SPEAKER_01: You know, the material is very sane and yet powerful.
[0:07:29] SPEAKER_01: And yet there was this moment for all of you listening where Brooke and I are sitting in
[0:07:35] SPEAKER_01: like the third row because like dorks, if you were watching social media, we got there
[0:07:40] SPEAKER_01: two hours early because we didn't have tickets in a little bit of fairness to us.
[0:07:45] SPEAKER_01: But even still, I guarantee Brooke would have made me get there at least 90 minutes early.
[0:07:50] SPEAKER_00: And it's my fault.
[0:07:52] SPEAKER_00: You would have.
[0:07:53] SPEAKER_00: I know I would have.
[0:07:54] Unknown: But I'm not the only one.
[0:07:56] SPEAKER_01: I'm like an hour and 15.
[0:07:58] SPEAKER_01: You're a solid 90.
[0:08:02] SPEAKER_01: So he's we're sitting in the third row and he looks what feels like at us, towards us,
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_01: vicinity of us, but feels like at us.
[0:08:14] SPEAKER_01: And I swear time stops.
[0:08:17] SPEAKER_01: It is the most unusual sensation.
[0:08:21] SPEAKER_01: I almost grabbed Brooke and said, is he dead?
[0:08:24] SPEAKER_01: Because it was like he wasn't blinking, the energy just like a vortex or something, just
[0:08:30] SPEAKER_01: like right at us.
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_01: Let Brooke give her own words for the experience.
[0:08:34] SPEAKER_01: But it was the strangest, most powerful sensation.
[0:08:38] SPEAKER_01: And it's not that I'm ascribing meaning to it, right?
[0:08:41] SPEAKER_01: It's just, whoa, something's happening that's beyond this thinking mind conversation, you
[0:08:48] SPEAKER_01: know, that's beyond the normal data that's always flowing through this computer mind.
[0:08:53] SPEAKER_01: Something else is happening.
[0:08:55] SPEAKER_01: There's some real felt experience.
[0:08:59] SPEAKER_01: Right. Yeah.
[0:09:00] Unknown: I mean, for me this weekend, but in general, going and physically being in person with
[0:09:09] SPEAKER_01: my teachers, like I recently had a retreat with Kieran Trace.
[0:09:12] SPEAKER_01: You and I started this whole path by doing the Meditating with the Body program at Dharma
[0:09:15] Unknown: Ocean. Like there's something critical about going and being in the presence of teachers,
[0:09:23] SPEAKER_01: but also in the presence of your community.
[0:09:25] SPEAKER_01: Right. That is not just about some important authoritative figure.
[0:09:29] SPEAKER_01: Right. That's not what I'm trying to say.
[0:09:31] SPEAKER_01: I'm just saying that the actual lived experience of showing up and you're with these other
[0:09:37] SPEAKER_01: people who are we're all on different places on the path, but we really care about this
[0:09:43] Unknown: or else we wouldn't be in this room in the first place.
[0:09:48] Unknown: I would say that if you're really serious about this journey, and I think based on what
[0:09:55] SPEAKER_01: we got out of yesterday, we can talk about what does that even mean?
[0:09:57] Unknown: What is this journey?
[0:10:00] SPEAKER_01: This is the game changer is to go and be in the presence of the teachers that you resonate
[0:10:05] Unknown: with, you know, you listening, whoever your people are.
[0:10:10] SPEAKER_01: Because there is something you just can't convey.
[0:10:12] SPEAKER_01: There's just not that many words.
[0:10:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there's something you can't convey.
[0:10:16] SPEAKER_01: And having gone to different teachers, all of who we respect and resonate with and learn
[0:10:22] Unknown: from and grow with, they each have a different flavor.
[0:10:26] SPEAKER_01: And that was extremely relieving.
[0:10:29] SPEAKER_01: There's something for us that I think is relieving to recognize.
[0:10:33] SPEAKER_01: Like these people are in deep contact with oneness and they're their own selves.
[0:10:41] SPEAKER_01: And it's really uniquely wonderful to experience that.
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_01: And the more you're around people and you can tune in and you can resonate with, is
[0:10:48] SPEAKER_01: this the vibe for me?
[0:10:50] SPEAKER_01: Do I get to a deeper level of revelation when I'm sitting in the experience of this container?
[0:10:56] SPEAKER_01: Or don't I?
[0:10:57] Unknown: You know, it's like this wonderful trying things on so you can feel into like this.
[0:11:06] SPEAKER_01: This is the thing.
[0:11:08] SPEAKER_01: I just wanted to say that part.
[0:11:09] Unknown: And maybe now we can scroll through some we can start to scroll through some of the things
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_01: that kind of popped up.
[0:11:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[0:11:22] SPEAKER_01: OK, let's talk about trust.
[0:11:24] SPEAKER_01: What do you think?
[0:11:25] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because I feel like that's the theme that, first of all, I kept repeating yesterday
[0:11:30] SPEAKER_01: and then also it keeps repeating.
[0:11:31] Unknown: Of course, these are the teachers that you and I are really drawn to working with.
[0:11:36] SPEAKER_01: Is the ones who clarify that's what's up here.
[0:11:39] Unknown: You know, they remove so much of the pomp and circumstance, the rituals and the fancy
[0:11:46] SPEAKER_01: long Sanskrit words that aren't from our culture.
[0:11:49] SPEAKER_01: And there's none.
[0:11:51] SPEAKER_01: It's just what is it we're actually doing here?
[0:11:54] Unknown: And I think it always comes down to living from truth or what we would say, which we
[0:12:00] SPEAKER_01: got from the Dharma Ocean lineage, trusting your life.
[0:12:05] SPEAKER_01: And it sounds so sweet and so simple and so obvious when you hear it.
[0:12:10] SPEAKER_01: It's like, well, sure, like I'm a good person and I care about the path and I'm going to
[0:12:14] SPEAKER_01: trust my life.
[0:12:15] SPEAKER_01: And then you do it.
[0:12:18] SPEAKER_01: And then you have to go.
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_01: Step by step into the lived experience of it, you discover that that's quite a journey.
[0:12:26] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, that's good.
[0:12:27] SPEAKER_01: You didn't use any scary language like I was about to like walking through the fire and,
[0:12:32] SPEAKER_01: you know, all of this scary imagery, which it shouldn't really be.
[0:12:35] SPEAKER_01: You know, there was two themes.
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_01: So there was the trust your life, which I have so much on because he was really weaving
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_01: that in his own language so often.
[0:12:43] SPEAKER_01: And then the other part that I thought was really interesting, just to give you guys
[0:12:47] SPEAKER_01: like my own take on Adyashanti, you know, just look him up and get your own experience
[0:12:53] SPEAKER_01: of him. But he is talking about awakening.
[0:12:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he's an awakening teacher.
[0:12:57] SPEAKER_01: Like, that's clear. He identifies as an awakening.
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he wants humanity to awaken.
[0:13:02] SPEAKER_01: He's awakened.
[0:13:03] SPEAKER_01: And and one the other thread that I thought that was very interesting was this idea that
[0:13:09] SPEAKER_01: awakening, which some of you may know as enlightenment or realization, you know, there's
[0:13:14] SPEAKER_01: all sorts of different words for it that have gotten sort of corrupted and confusing.
[0:13:20] SPEAKER_01: But what he said was it's simply.
[0:13:25] SPEAKER_01: Gosh, I'm going to misquote this, but it's simply you becoming the most you.
[0:13:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. It's like you becoming the truest you.
[0:13:32] SPEAKER_01: Right. You without all the distortions, without all the shoulds and shouldn'ts.
[0:13:38] SPEAKER_01: And you're a good person if you do X, you're a bad person if you do Y.
[0:13:42] SPEAKER_01: Just the most genuine natural.
[0:13:47] SPEAKER_01: Thing you move towards when you're not distorting yourself with harmful, painful
[0:13:53] SPEAKER_01: belief systems and.
[0:13:55] SPEAKER_01: Programs, I guess we could say.
[0:13:57] SPEAKER_01: OK, did find a great quote.
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_01: Sweet. Oh, my gosh.
[0:13:59] SPEAKER_01: Here goes Adyashanti notes.
[0:14:01] SPEAKER_01: I love a great quote that he said to that awakening is the liberation of the individual.
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_00: Oh, so good.
[0:14:09] SPEAKER_01: And he also moved on to say awakening is feeling unity and individuality at the same
[0:14:12] SPEAKER_01: moment. Right. That's where it gets confusing.
[0:14:15] SPEAKER_01: And we don't even need to unpack that paradox because you just can't.
[0:14:17] SPEAKER_01: Doesn't matter. Just read Adyashanti or go see him.
[0:14:21] SPEAKER_01: But but that's what's really fascinating is like.
[0:14:24] SPEAKER_01: Is that it is this path of removing the obstacles to us recognizing who we are.
[0:14:31] Unknown: When you when you study psychology, you're kind of aiming at something similar.
[0:14:37] Unknown: Right. You don't call it spiritual, but you know, when we've gone to therapy in the
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_01: past or worked with coaches or all the different things we've done, it's like, well,
[0:14:47] SPEAKER_01: what were we looking at reducing suffering?
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_01: Well, what is suffering?
[0:14:51] SPEAKER_01: It's believing stuff that's not true.
[0:14:53] SPEAKER_01: And operating from a place of fear and limitation.
[0:14:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And believing that's something that something different from what's actually
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_01: occurring in reality should be happening.
[0:15:04] Unknown: Then what's actually happening?
[0:15:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Meeting what's actually happening.
[0:15:07] SPEAKER_01: Right. So that's what it begins.
[0:15:09] SPEAKER_01: I get almost it's funny.
[0:15:10] SPEAKER_01: Weren't you and I talking about when did this path quote unquote begin for us?
[0:15:14] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, we can start looking back at, you know, what we did meditating with the
[0:15:18] SPEAKER_01: body two years ago.
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_01: We had this big explosive kind of movement.
[0:15:21] SPEAKER_01: The stream started to move really quickly from there.
[0:15:24] SPEAKER_01: Yes. And then we could look all well, when did I start meditating?
[0:15:27] SPEAKER_01: But really, I believe a lot of my psychological unfolding, you know, working with therapists,
[0:15:33] SPEAKER_01: working with coaches like our first coach and all of that as part of it, like all of
[0:15:38] SPEAKER_01: it, because it was all me trying to understand who am I really and how do I reduce suffering?
[0:15:44] SPEAKER_01: And what is the way that I'm interacting with myself in life?
[0:15:47] SPEAKER_01: That is creating inhibition.
[0:15:49] SPEAKER_01: Right. But limitation.
[0:15:52] Unknown: Yeah. So I think that that idea that even the spiritual path is this liberation of yourself.
[0:16:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Which is so often not spoken about that way, because in so many Eastern traditions,
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_01: it may be like the negation of the self is really fascinating.
[0:16:13] Unknown: And I don't want to add to too many of my own words to this.
[0:16:16] SPEAKER_01: I think it's just like pointing at it.
[0:16:18] SPEAKER_01: And y'all can look up people who have more in-depth things to say about it.
[0:16:24] Unknown: But I just think that this idea of recognizing how often we're in conflict with who we are
[0:16:34] SPEAKER_01: and that that's a lot of suffering.
[0:16:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. You know, trusting life is also trusting ourselves.
[0:16:40] SPEAKER_01: Right. Yeah. And a lot of what he talked about.
[0:16:44] SPEAKER_01: So how do you trust life?
[0:16:47] Unknown: And one of the things he brought up that keeps being repeated with all of our teachers, you
[0:16:51] SPEAKER_01: get to see all these different flavors of person conveying the same thing in a different
[0:16:56] Unknown: way, is that the body is this profound guide to what is true for you.
[0:17:07] SPEAKER_01: In any given moment, like I saw, I did a two day satsang with Sat Sri recently.
[0:17:13] SPEAKER_01: I don't know if I said this on the show before, but at some point he said, enlightenment is
[0:17:18] SPEAKER_01: just a fire in the body, like a literal sensation in the body.
[0:17:21] SPEAKER_01: And when you move towards things that are true, it feels good.
[0:17:26] Unknown: And when you try and do things that are not true, it hurts.
[0:17:30] SPEAKER_01: That's it. You know, like that's all.
[0:17:33] SPEAKER_01: And then I just think that's the way to do it.
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_01: You know, like that's all.
[0:17:36] SPEAKER_01: And then Adyashanti is saying the body is this amazing, what truth, very sensitive,
[0:17:41] SPEAKER_01: truth seeking instrument.
[0:17:44] SPEAKER_01: And he just kept coming back to you like these things that we live in, these bodies that
[0:17:48] Unknown: we are, are just remarkably fine tuned.
[0:17:53] SPEAKER_01: What was the one where he said we normally think of the body as?
[0:17:57] SPEAKER_01: He said these instruments of our bodies are calibrated to truths.
[0:18:01] SPEAKER_01: Usually what we think of as our bodies are just appetites, but the body doesn't lie.
[0:18:07] SPEAKER_01: But we just have to get more subtle in our relationship to what the body is and how it
[0:18:13] SPEAKER_01: conveys messages. And he said the more conscious you get, the more acute the information
[0:18:19] SPEAKER_01: from the body gets.
[0:18:21] Unknown: And then you can't ignore it in the way that maybe you could have gotten away with before.
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_01: So we have if we're if what we're talking about just as a concept is that there's
[0:18:32] SPEAKER_01: thinking mind, separate self, egoic self, whatever you want to call it, and then the
[0:18:39] SPEAKER_01: truth of the body.
[0:18:41] SPEAKER_01: And for a long time, if we think that we are our thoughts about ourselves and about the
[0:18:48] SPEAKER_01: world, it makes sense that if we're completely consumed by that, that we can just live from
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_01: that place. Once we get a little peek at truth and we start to deepen into our bodies
[0:18:58] SPEAKER_01: and listen to our bodies more and realize like, oh, you know, even though it makes
[0:19:02] SPEAKER_01: perfect logical sense that I would take this job that I went to a job interview on, I
[0:19:08] SPEAKER_01: just can't seem to move in the direction of accepting the job.
[0:19:13] SPEAKER_01: There's something that says no.
[0:19:14] SPEAKER_01: And the something that says no is just some sensation of I just can't seem to make
[0:19:20] Unknown: myself go that way.
[0:19:24] SPEAKER_01: Once we start to get more in tune to those kinds of sensations, just as an example,
[0:19:30] Unknown: then we. We can't really ignore it anymore.
[0:19:35] SPEAKER_01: Well, we can, but it hurts and then we have to judge ourselves for ignoring it, which
[0:19:40] SPEAKER_01: is a super shitty phase.
[0:19:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Is when like you can feel it, yet you still keep overriding it somehow with your
[0:19:49] Unknown: programming and your thoughts and then you feel shitty that you did that, because in
[0:19:57] SPEAKER_01: retrospect, you do have some ability to have tracked it.
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_01: You know, it's like what I don't know if I gave the stupid bookcase example here.
[0:20:05] SPEAKER_01: I think I did. And I know I did in our Being Human series.
[0:20:08] Unknown: But OK, here's an example from what happened over the last week.
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_01: If you've been listening, you know, I got sick from mold poisoning.
[0:20:17] SPEAKER_01: What one of the things mold does is it secretes a toxin and it gets into your furniture, too.
[0:20:22] SPEAKER_01: OK, so when I lived in Austin, I get all my new my old furniture from Miami.
[0:20:26] SPEAKER_01: There's a chance I was going to be reactive to it.
[0:20:29] SPEAKER_01: Long story short, there was a bookcase I was reactive to.
[0:20:32] SPEAKER_01: I seem to be invested in not acknowledging that, even though my body was showing symptoms,
[0:20:37] SPEAKER_01: because I would have these threads of thought like, shouldn't it be mind over matter?
[0:20:42] SPEAKER_01: Shouldn't you be able to get over it?
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_01: I think maybe you should be able to get over it.
[0:20:45] SPEAKER_01: And then I would think like, I don't really want to cost my husband more,
[0:20:49] SPEAKER_01: not financially, emotionally, because it was a sentimental piece,
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_01: because I've already had to make him move.
[0:20:55] SPEAKER_01: And I want to be done with my illness.
[0:20:57] SPEAKER_01: So can't I just pretend that it's mind over matter?
[0:21:00] SPEAKER_01: So all of these things are operating.
[0:21:02] SPEAKER_01: And even though my body gave me the clearest indication
[0:21:06] SPEAKER_01: that I had a problem with this piece of furniture, it took me
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_01: three to four days to sort through and finally admit that
[0:21:14] SPEAKER_01: and move towards truth.
[0:21:16] SPEAKER_01: So Brooke and I then come to Ithaca to see Adi Ashanti.
[0:21:19] SPEAKER_01: We have a beautiful road trip.
[0:21:22] SPEAKER_01: We roll up into our hotel, walk into our room.
[0:21:25] SPEAKER_01: First thing that happens, we get smacked into the face with the smell of mildew.
[0:21:29] SPEAKER_01: Really strong, gross mildew.
[0:21:32] SPEAKER_01: Gross mildew. Go to the front desk.
[0:21:34] SPEAKER_01: They know it's mildew.
[0:21:34] SPEAKER_01: They send us to another room that doesn't smell like mildew.
[0:21:38] SPEAKER_01: But 10 minutes into sitting there, I start to get my symptoms.
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, oh, Brooke, I'm not feeling well.
[0:21:44] SPEAKER_01: Now, for me, this is complicated.
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_01: We didn't know if we can get our money back because there was no manager on site.
[0:21:49] SPEAKER_01: So how good is this setup?
[0:21:50] SPEAKER_01: All of the prepaid.
[0:21:52] SPEAKER_01: So I can trust my body, but then I might have to pay extra money.
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_01: I don't know if I can get a new hotel.
[0:22:00] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to be this weird one.
[0:22:01] SPEAKER_01: What if I'm wrong and I'm putting me and Brooke out and I'm wrong and like,
[0:22:05] SPEAKER_01: you know, maybe it's just in my mind and it's psychosomatic
[0:22:08] SPEAKER_01: and because I smelled the mildew.
[0:22:10] SPEAKER_01: So all of these things are racing through my head.
[0:22:12] SPEAKER_01: But luckily, now in this moment, because I am learning and things are shifting.
[0:22:17] SPEAKER_01: Brooke and I have enough clarity to say, let's just leave.
[0:22:21] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Right. Let's just leave.
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_01: We do. We find a brilliant hotel that's clean and new and fresh.
[0:22:27] SPEAKER_01: We actually get our money back.
[0:22:29] SPEAKER_01: Everything is fine.
[0:22:30] SPEAKER_01: This simple, stupid little vignette
[0:22:34] SPEAKER_01: is the whole process of trusting life
[0:22:37] SPEAKER_01: and the complexity that we create for ourselves
[0:22:42] SPEAKER_01: around just trusting the information that's coming to us
[0:22:45] SPEAKER_01: because we don't want to identify a certain way
[0:22:48] SPEAKER_01: or because we don't want to let go of a certain identity
[0:22:51] SPEAKER_01: identity we have or because we don't want to confront
[0:22:55] SPEAKER_01: a pain body or a painful belief system.
[0:22:58] SPEAKER_01: Like for me, example, I don't want to burden anyone.
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to be weird.
[0:23:02] SPEAKER_01: I don't want to be weak, you know, whatever the case is.
[0:23:05] SPEAKER_01: Now, this isn't even us talking about
[0:23:07] SPEAKER_01: feeling like if you don't take a job, you can't put food on your table
[0:23:12] SPEAKER_01: for your family or talking about getting a divorce
[0:23:15] SPEAKER_01: from someone you've been with for 15 years.
[0:23:18] SPEAKER_01: But something's just not feeling right anymore.
[0:23:20] SPEAKER_01: You know, the stakes are so much higher
[0:23:24] SPEAKER_01: than getting rid of a bookcase that ultimately is a six hundred dollar
[0:23:28] SPEAKER_01: investment and a little sentimental.
[0:23:30] SPEAKER_01: But for crying out loud, it's not like that big a deal.
[0:23:34] SPEAKER_01: And even with that, someone was as much practice as me with clarity.
[0:23:39] SPEAKER_01: Had to go through a whole process around it.
[0:23:41] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So that's the complexity we bump into when we start to work
[0:23:47] SPEAKER_01: with trusting our lives. It's a beautiful idea.
[0:23:50] SPEAKER_01: And as long as things are flowing in a stream, it's a lovely feeling.
[0:23:54] SPEAKER_01: And it's simple enough.
[0:23:56] SPEAKER_01: But when we get really honest.
[0:24:01] SPEAKER_01: The things that life will invite.
[0:24:04] SPEAKER_01: When we're available to truth, don't always fit into our egos.
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_01: Idea of what safety or happiness or good would look and feel like.
[0:24:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think they very rarely do because it's this opportunity.
[0:24:18] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of a little wink of.
[0:24:22] SPEAKER_01: Such an obnoxiously overused term, the universe, the source, whatever.
[0:24:27] SPEAKER_01: Giving you this opportunity, will you
[0:24:31] SPEAKER_01: do you have the availability to choose different this time?
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_01: You know, so for with the bookcase.
[0:24:37] SPEAKER_01: So in Miami, it took what years?
[0:24:39] SPEAKER_01: Oh, God, years with the bookcase.
[0:24:41] SPEAKER_01: It took days with the hotel room.
[0:24:44] SPEAKER_01: It took minutes.
[0:24:45] SPEAKER_01: And it was perfectly pressurized for both of us because I have money pain body.
[0:24:49] SPEAKER_01: I could have easily been like, oh, my God.
[0:24:51] SPEAKER_01: And I and even though we made the choice to leave, I could have been up all night
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_01: waiting to hear from the hotel manager.
[0:24:57] SPEAKER_01: Oh, my God. If we don't get that money back.
[0:24:59] SPEAKER_01: I don't have an extra six hundred dollars like that, you know.
[0:25:03] SPEAKER_01: And I just didn't feel that way because I've but only because I've developed
[0:25:07] SPEAKER_01: enough facility with moving from truth that it's like, you know what?
[0:25:10] SPEAKER_01: It's just it's not an option to stay.
[0:25:12] SPEAKER_01: It's just not an option. You're sick.
[0:25:14] SPEAKER_01: It's just not going to work.
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_01: So I trust that that's exactly the current is taking us there.
[0:25:22] SPEAKER_01: Something it's going to work out. It's going to be fine.
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_01: And I didn't stress and it did work out just fine.
[0:25:27] SPEAKER_01: The current was taking us to this
[0:25:29] SPEAKER_01: very clear place and to your point about
[0:25:33] SPEAKER_01: there's the big high stakes things.
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_01: Something I really appreciated that Adyashanti said yesterday is
[0:25:40] SPEAKER_01: do it with the stuff that's low stakes.
[0:25:42] SPEAKER_01: If you if we're working on trusting your life, if we're working on living
[0:25:46] SPEAKER_01: from truth, living from clarity, just start with the little things.
[0:25:51] SPEAKER_01: Don't say I'm just learning to walk and I have to.
[0:25:54] SPEAKER_01: This is a quote from Adyashanti.
[0:25:55] SPEAKER_01: I'm just learning to walk and I have to run a marathon tomorrow.
[0:25:58] SPEAKER_01: Please help me.
[0:25:59] SPEAKER_01: No, don't run a marathon tomorrow if you're just learning to walk.
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_01: I mean, sometimes there are things that are like really pressurized
[0:26:05] SPEAKER_01: and right up in our face
[0:26:08] SPEAKER_01: that we've been ignoring for a long time.
[0:26:10] SPEAKER_01: And it is an invitation to say, OK, I need to really face.
[0:26:14] SPEAKER_01: I can't work at this job anymore.
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_01: I can't stay in this marriage anymore. OK.
[0:26:17] SPEAKER_01: But in general, can we do it with the things initially where it's
[0:26:21] SPEAKER_01: this playful exploration to see, can I just
[0:26:26] SPEAKER_01: go to the grocery store and only buy the things that feel
[0:26:31] SPEAKER_01: really like a yes and not know I'm doing this diet right now
[0:26:37] SPEAKER_01: and I can't possibly and but how can we do it for the lower stakes things
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_01: to build it is building a muscle in a certain way.
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_01: It's you have to have enough experience with anything to trust.
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I wouldn't go do a gymnastics competition.
[0:26:53] SPEAKER_01: I would have to build the experience of being able to do anything related
[0:26:57] Unknown: to something bendy, something springy, start with having some flexibility
[0:27:02] SPEAKER_01: and touching your toes.
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_01: Maybe I'm on it.
[0:27:05] SPEAKER_01: It took me 20 years, but I'm there.
[0:27:07] SPEAKER_01: So I just thought that was a very sane thing, too, that I would love to pass along.
[0:27:12] SPEAKER_01: We don't have to. Oh, my God. OK.
[0:27:14] SPEAKER_01: And become hyper vigilant.
[0:27:15] SPEAKER_01: How am I screwing up?
[0:27:17] SPEAKER_01: Because the mind likes to do that, too, to make us bad and wrong
[0:27:20] SPEAKER_01: for not 100 percent living from truth.
[0:27:22] SPEAKER_01: Living from truth is a very, very, very big, beautiful,
[0:27:26] SPEAKER_01: but challenging and unfamiliar journey, and it's not one that our culture supports.
[0:27:31] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was thinking two things.
[0:27:33] SPEAKER_01: One is that like part of it is OK.
[0:27:37] SPEAKER_01: So in this case, it worked out.
[0:27:38] SPEAKER_01: And that was a really lovely experience for us to see it all worked out.
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, pretty much like a bow was on it.
[0:27:44] SPEAKER_01: So that's cool.
[0:27:46] Unknown: But even if we didn't know if it would write,
[0:27:50] SPEAKER_01: that was part of the upshot of what we're saying.
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_01: And yet there's still no arguing with life.
[0:27:56] SPEAKER_01: And I think this is what maturity is, right, is recognizing
[0:28:02] SPEAKER_01: me crossing my arms against life never works.
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_01: And Adia said something like to be present is to be available
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_01: to life, which is to be available to truth, just to recognize like, well,
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_01: it's no longer an option for me to stay here.
[0:28:20] SPEAKER_01: Now, I don't know what else is going to come next.
[0:28:24] SPEAKER_01: But what I can tell with my discernment when I admit truth
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_01: is it was no longer an option to stay in the hotel.
[0:28:31] SPEAKER_01: And that's the only thing I could know.
[0:28:33] SPEAKER_01: Right. This is not an option.
[0:28:35] SPEAKER_01: And then what options could open for me were still to be revealed.
[0:28:41] SPEAKER_01: So I can be mad about that because I can't play it out
[0:28:43] SPEAKER_01: and know I'm going to be safe. Right.
[0:28:45] SPEAKER_01: Like, what are the odds there's no manager in a hotel?
[0:28:48] SPEAKER_01: That was the weirdest.
[0:28:49] SPEAKER_01: I know. And.
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_01: Well, I just have to take this business card and trust that if you call tomorrow,
[0:28:53] SPEAKER_01: you'll probably get your almost seven hundred dollars back.
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_01: But I don't know. I don't know.
[0:28:58] SPEAKER_01: Like that is so rare and almost unheard of that it was set up like that.
[0:29:04] SPEAKER_01: But thank you. That was a wonderful like learning experience.
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_01: So we couldn't know that we were going to be safe.
[0:29:13] SPEAKER_01: Right. Safety looks like we call Orbit.
[0:29:16] SPEAKER_01: So whoever you booked with and we yell at them and we get it straight
[0:29:20] SPEAKER_01: and this hotel has Meldo and, you know.
[0:29:24] SPEAKER_01: But the only thing we knew is we couldn't argue with life.
[0:29:26] Unknown: And I think that's a really important point.
[0:29:31] SPEAKER_01: You know, that to be present is to be available to the truth.
[0:29:35] SPEAKER_01: And the funny thing I said is like, the more you are on this path,
[0:29:41] SPEAKER_01: whatever it is, listening to us going to teachers,
[0:29:45] SPEAKER_01: reading, meditating, yoga, whatever it is y'all are doing
[0:29:49] SPEAKER_01: that you consider to be your path, that not only is your mind learning,
[0:29:54] SPEAKER_01: but your body's learning.
[0:29:56] SPEAKER_01: So at a certain point, your egoic strategy may try to push away
[0:30:04] SPEAKER_01: what it doesn't feel safe with, like, oh, this is all well and good
[0:30:07] SPEAKER_01: to trust my life, except for when it comes to leaving this job.
[0:30:13] SPEAKER_01: And yet your body, then, will keep holding.
[0:30:18] SPEAKER_01: It'll keep holding you to task.
[0:30:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. It won't let you get away with it.
[0:30:22] SPEAKER_01: Hurt enough.
[0:30:23] SPEAKER_01: It'll hurt enough that you have to turn towards reality.
[0:30:27] SPEAKER_01: What's actually happening?
[0:30:29] SPEAKER_01: That's just a I mean, we've both seen that.
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_01: It's just a really interesting thing, especially when we're talking
[0:30:34] SPEAKER_01: to a bunch of people who a lot of you are very sensitive.
[0:30:37] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, oh, my God, my body is going to become an even more
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: sensitive instrument.
[0:30:41] SPEAKER_01: It's like, holy crap, you better get on the truth train.
[0:30:44] SPEAKER_01: I know. Well, that's the thing, right?
[0:30:46] SPEAKER_01: Because it is my body is very, very, very sensitive right now.
[0:30:50] SPEAKER_01: And I'm going through this phase of learning how to pilot that ship.
[0:30:54] SPEAKER_01: And and it can be overwhelming.
[0:30:57] SPEAKER_01: But if you come back to the basic instruction and then the multiple
[0:31:02] Unknown: times lived experience of, well, when I just turn towards truth,
[0:31:08] SPEAKER_01: it doesn't hurt.
[0:31:10] Unknown: You know, the hurt sensation hurt, meaning
[0:31:14] SPEAKER_01: a myriad of things could be, like you said, an illness,
[0:31:16] SPEAKER_01: but it could also just be overwhelm or just a lot of energy moving
[0:31:19] SPEAKER_01: or anxiety or frequent thinking and like all those dramas in your brain.
[0:31:27] SPEAKER_01: That when I turn towards.
[0:31:30] Unknown: Truth that that doesn't hurt,
[0:31:33] SPEAKER_01: that's it's like such a great, actually very, very straightforward compass.
[0:31:37] SPEAKER_01: But damn, if it isn't hard to do, even though you know it,
[0:31:41] SPEAKER_01: even though you've lived it, it's like there's this it is like this actual
[0:31:46] SPEAKER_01: literal wiring or something in your system.
[0:31:48] SPEAKER_01: It's just run this program for so long that it takes a while to.
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: Unpattern it.
[0:31:54] SPEAKER_01: It takes a while to pull to see all the different wires and pull them out and go,
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_01: oh, now I'm doing that exact same thing, exact same story over in this category
[0:32:03] SPEAKER_01: where I never saw that in operation before, and I see it now.
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_01: And then, well, for me, I'm dealing with them
[0:32:10] SPEAKER_01: without going into this too much, but a loss of strength in my hands and my job.
[0:32:15] SPEAKER_01: My work is as a ropher where I have to have the ability to work with my hands.
[0:32:20] SPEAKER_01: So that can be really scary.
[0:32:21] SPEAKER_01: It's got all kinds of stuff tied up in it.
[0:32:23] SPEAKER_01: Identity, work, paying the bills, money story.
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_01: Tons of stuff.
[0:32:29] SPEAKER_01: And it's like all I can do is just navigate little step by step.
[0:32:33] SPEAKER_01: It could be telling me a multitude of things, and so I can run off
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_01: and it doesn't mean I'm not supposed to be a ropher anymore.
[0:32:38] SPEAKER_01: Does it mean?
[0:32:39] SPEAKER_01: And all I can do is whatever is the just next step.
[0:32:42] SPEAKER_01: OK, I need to take a week off from work.
[0:32:44] SPEAKER_01: The only thing I know right now is I can't just suffer through another week of work
[0:32:49] SPEAKER_01: really hurting myself. OK, week off.
[0:32:52] SPEAKER_01: Next thing. OK, I have these practitioners who I haven't been seeing
[0:32:55] Unknown: who can help me. I can get input. Go there. All right.
[0:32:58] SPEAKER_01: And there's all these different avenues to look at.
[0:33:01] SPEAKER_01: But it's really this what's right here, step by step.
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_01: What's right here and keep trusting.
[0:33:07] SPEAKER_01: Because the reality is, if my hands are super weak and it hurts to work,
[0:33:11] Unknown: I can't just abuse myself and go, well, you know.
[0:33:16] SPEAKER_01: Well, eventually the gig is up. Right.
[0:33:19] SPEAKER_01: You can't push past truth.
[0:33:21] SPEAKER_01: I think this was the interesting quote
[0:33:25] SPEAKER_01: that's in alignment with what we're saying.
[0:33:27] SPEAKER_01: Having a thought that opposes what is, is the prescription for suffering.
[0:33:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's such a good one. Right.
[0:33:35] SPEAKER_01: So here we are.
[0:33:36] SPEAKER_01: Why do we take so many of the paths we take, whether you're interested
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_01: in psychology or personal development or spirituality?
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_01: It's like, why do we begin these things?
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_01: Well, either we're moving towards something beautiful,
[0:33:50] SPEAKER_01: like I want more of these yummy experiences of oneness or something along those lines.
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_01: But by and large, we're moving away from suffering.
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_01: So we want to suffer less.
[0:34:00] SPEAKER_01: And that's a very human movement.
[0:34:02] SPEAKER_01: And yet we create our own suffering by opposing life.
[0:34:06] SPEAKER_01: So what we did when we left that hotel had really no suffering.
[0:34:12] SPEAKER_01: That hotel was dank anyway.
[0:34:13] SPEAKER_01: We got to this really now we're in a super nice one.
[0:34:15] SPEAKER_01: We're sitting in the room right now.
[0:34:17] SPEAKER_01: It's like really comfy.
[0:34:18] SPEAKER_01: And and immediately we had no suffering.
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_01: Luckily, we've evolved past our brains doing a lot of the dance with the stories.
[0:34:26] SPEAKER_01: But if I was to have posed what was.
[0:34:30] SPEAKER_01: You would have been watching me because you have a caretaking heart, too.
[0:34:33] SPEAKER_01: And like, is she OK? Is she OK?
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_01: Oh, she's anxious.
[0:34:35] SPEAKER_01: Like, I would. I mean, I was spiraling down.
[0:34:37] SPEAKER_01: So actually, it would have gotten really bad.
[0:34:40] SPEAKER_01: And I would have been worried and I had been thinking and I would have been second
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_01: thinking and then I'd been like, oh, my God, I got to talk to Karen about this.
[0:34:45] SPEAKER_01: Like, and all of this suffering would have happened.
[0:34:48] SPEAKER_01: And what really happened was we went to our hotel, we watched Rick and Morty
[0:34:51] SPEAKER_01: and we went to sleep and it was delightful.
[0:34:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we got to see how to shine.
[0:34:55] SPEAKER_01: So it's not the story of the weekend where you were throwing up
[0:34:58] SPEAKER_01: and passing out all weekend or the story of the weekend where I had to pay six
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_01: hundred dollars I don't have and I have to take extra time off of work
[0:35:04] SPEAKER_01: because my hands are fucked up.
[0:35:07] SPEAKER_01: No, just it was just flowed.
[0:35:09] SPEAKER_01: Relief. And I think that just noticing the amount of time
[0:35:14] SPEAKER_01: lapse that happens between it hurts.
[0:35:17] SPEAKER_01: There's something I'm not turning towards in reality
[0:35:20] SPEAKER_01: and turning towards it and it flowing smoother.
[0:35:23] SPEAKER_01: Just being able to see the shorter time interval.
[0:35:27] SPEAKER_01: Because really, I mean, I've spent decades turning away from certain truths we all have.
[0:35:31] SPEAKER_01: That's just a part of the human experience.
[0:35:33] SPEAKER_01: That's totally normal.
[0:35:34] SPEAKER_01: But seeing that I can sort of trip the switch of, no, that's not what's happening
[0:35:39] SPEAKER_01: in reality is what's happening in reality.
[0:35:41] SPEAKER_01: It's only going to hurt more the more I turn away.
[0:35:44] SPEAKER_01: And I think that there's so much to be said for what he brought up that
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_01: once your body is hip to truth, once you've turned towards it enough, it's like, OK.
[0:35:54] SPEAKER_01: It starts to run the ship.
[0:35:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it does. It starts to run the ship and you have to learn how to pilot that ship,
[0:36:00] SPEAKER_01: which is very different than all of the separate self strategies
[0:36:03] SPEAKER_01: that we've all learned how to get by with.
[0:36:05] SPEAKER_01: I kind of think that's the hallmark of the ego, right?
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_01: Like the hallmark of the ego is it thinks it can do it better than God
[0:36:12] SPEAKER_01: or reality or life or the universe.
[0:36:14] SPEAKER_01: Fill in your choice.
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_01: And my strategies are going to do this.
[0:36:20] SPEAKER_01: You know? Yeah.
[0:36:21] SPEAKER_01: I just have to figure out the right angle or behave the right way
[0:36:25] SPEAKER_01: or go on the right diet or exercise my way there.
[0:36:28] SPEAKER_01: Do the right persona. Yeah.
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_01: Or find the right lover.
[0:36:32] SPEAKER_01: Like it fill in the blanks.
[0:36:33] SPEAKER_01: Yes. Like my ego strategy is and I want to be.
[0:36:38] SPEAKER_01: Oh, my God. He had such a good line. Wait. Hold on.
[0:36:40] SPEAKER_01: Oh, we will fail at being the person we imagine ourselves to be
[0:36:46] SPEAKER_01: because we can't fucking be a concept.
[0:36:49] SPEAKER_01: No, because we're these alive beings who are constantly becoming.
[0:36:54] SPEAKER_01: We were talking about this in the car and this comes from our teacher,
[0:36:57] SPEAKER_01: Karen Trace.
[0:36:58] SPEAKER_01: She walked through the normal human lifespan,
[0:37:02] SPEAKER_01: developmental stages, and it was so illuminating for me.
[0:37:05] SPEAKER_01: Like if you think about yourself, so first you're an infant,
[0:37:07] SPEAKER_01: then you're a toddler, then you're a child, then you're a tween,
[0:37:11] SPEAKER_01: then you're an adolescent, then you're a young adult.
[0:37:12] SPEAKER_01: You know, and if you just think about these normal developmental stages
[0:37:15] SPEAKER_01: that we all go through, God willing.
[0:37:19] Unknown: We three year old Brooke.
[0:37:24] SPEAKER_01: Has a certain essence of brookness that I still have,
[0:37:28] SPEAKER_01: but I'm not at all like three year old Brooke.
[0:37:31] SPEAKER_01: You know, 14 year old Brooke has a certain essence of brookness,
[0:37:35] SPEAKER_01: but 14 year old Brooke and 42 year old Brooke are so different.
[0:37:41] SPEAKER_01: Even if I think about, you know, 35 year old Brooke,
[0:37:46] SPEAKER_01: if I were to meet her, if she were a separate person for me,
[0:37:49] Unknown: if I were to meet her at a retreat weekend, she would probably annoy me.
[0:37:55] SPEAKER_01: She would also endear me.
[0:37:57] SPEAKER_01: There would be certain things, but I there's so much of that
[0:38:00] SPEAKER_01: that's shifted because as long as we're alive,
[0:38:04] SPEAKER_01: we're in a developmental process.
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_01: These stages of becoming, of developing, which we can think of
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_01: in just physiological terms, adolescence, young adulthood.
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_01: They don't they're not sealed off pods and like, well, now I did this
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_01: and now I'm this solid person that's trapped in this.
[0:38:24] SPEAKER_01: You know, we're always becoming, we're always evolving.
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_01: So they I mean, didn't even I I might misquote idea here,
[0:38:31] SPEAKER_01: but he said something like that's the paradox being is always becoming.
[0:38:35] SPEAKER_01: Yes. And and that's it's like that Zen quote.
[0:38:39] SPEAKER_01: That's something like you're perfectly imperfect.
[0:38:41] SPEAKER_01: And then there's one that's like, you're right where you need to be
[0:38:44] SPEAKER_01: and you need to be, you know, evolving.
[0:38:47] SPEAKER_01: Like there's all these kinds of quotes that point at these paradoxes
[0:38:50] SPEAKER_01: that it's like, yes, this is there is an essential nature.
[0:38:54] Unknown: There is a brook ish and there's a Vanessa ish.
[0:38:58] SPEAKER_01: And they're very different.
[0:38:59] SPEAKER_01: It's what we were pointing to at the beginning of the talk.
[0:39:03] SPEAKER_01: Adia points to, let's say, looking at Jesus and Buddha.
[0:39:07] SPEAKER_01: And there's these two very, quote, unquote, enlightened,
[0:39:11] SPEAKER_01: you know, aware of the light people.
[0:39:14] SPEAKER_01: And yet their flavor was very different.
[0:39:16] SPEAKER_01: And you can look around the world at all global traditions and see the same thing.
[0:39:20] SPEAKER_01: And so there's this brookness and there's this Vanessa Ness.
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_01: And it is alive and it is a being and it is in itself already there.
[0:39:28] SPEAKER_01: And it's also always becoming.
[0:39:31] Unknown: And we have to hold that paradox, which isn't so complicated.
[0:39:35] SPEAKER_01: Like Adia Shanti was saying yesterday, because everything is paradox.
[0:39:38] SPEAKER_01: We're always holding paradox.
[0:39:39] SPEAKER_01: So not so complicated.
[0:39:40] SPEAKER_01: We've always been becoming like I can look back and go, yeah, I was a teenager once.
[0:39:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And we've always been being because most of us never sat down
[0:39:48] Unknown: and decided what to think, feel, you know, like, who will I be?
[0:39:52] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'm going to be somebody with a lot of self-esteem issues.
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: Because that sounds like a really fucking great plan.
[0:39:56] SPEAKER_01: I never decided. No, that got coded into the system at a time
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_01: when you didn't get to to pick and choose and say, actually, no, thanks.
[0:40:04] SPEAKER_01: Mom and dad, don't program me with that based on your programming.
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_01: Pass on that. No, there's a the other thing I thought was interesting is
[0:40:14] SPEAKER_01: then this is where I'm going to butcher him.
[0:40:16] Unknown: And by the way, the weekend intensive we're at is going to be available for audio.
[0:40:22] SPEAKER_01: I think they said in like three or four weeks.
[0:40:24] SPEAKER_01: So that's cool. We'll try to link it there if we can.
[0:40:27] Unknown: We'll at least link to his site so you can listen in for yourselves.
[0:40:30] SPEAKER_01: But he said something like people come to him and they're like,
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_01: how do I live more from truth?
[0:40:36] SPEAKER_01: This is the orientation that is the same for all of our teachers
[0:40:39] SPEAKER_01: that we've really resonated towards, which is truth.
[0:40:43] SPEAKER_01: Trusting your life and truth. That's that's always there for us.
[0:40:47] SPEAKER_01: So they said, how do I do that?
[0:40:48] Unknown: And he's like, well, live more honestly.
[0:40:53] SPEAKER_01: And and he's like, and no one wants to really hear that because, you know,
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_01: he's talking about telling the truth, living the truth, deciding from truth,
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: admitting the truth to yourself.
[0:41:03] SPEAKER_01: And everyone's like, oh, but that's going to get really uncomfortable
[0:41:06] SPEAKER_01: when I have to tell my partner I no longer want to have this job.
[0:41:10] Unknown: And I want to instead, I don't know what, become a painter.
[0:41:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't know to make something up like that's great.
[0:41:17] SPEAKER_01: The idea, but that's not going to lead to the happiness I was looking for.
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_01: Quote, unquote, thinking out of jail free card.
[0:41:23] SPEAKER_01: What do I call it? Getting your enlightenment certificate.
[0:41:26] SPEAKER_01: And you're done. Here you go.
[0:41:27] SPEAKER_01: Ta da. God, I always wanted an enlightenment certificate.
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_01: Doesn't everyone still wish it existed?
[0:41:33] SPEAKER_01: So so I think he, you know, and he was saying,
[0:41:37] SPEAKER_01: don't equate that with garbage, jumping your brain onto someone
[0:41:40] SPEAKER_01: because that's not living the truth.
[0:41:41] SPEAKER_01: Like, here's all the the like the garbage I've been accumulating
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_01: for 20 something years. Yeah.
[0:41:47] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to vent it on you.
[0:41:49] SPEAKER_01: You know, ideas about you in the world, but I'm just going to now throw it out.
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_01: Throw it up on you. Yeah, it's more,
[0:41:57] SPEAKER_01: you know, what's in alignment for me, what's in alignment for me
[0:41:59] SPEAKER_01: is to have a conversation with you for now.
[0:42:01] SPEAKER_01: What's in alignment for me is not to speak right now.
[0:42:03] Unknown: What's in alignment for me is to eat food.
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_01: What's in alignment for me is to go to a meditation retreat,
[0:42:10] SPEAKER_01: not to go to my family reunion.
[0:42:12] SPEAKER_01: You know, what's in alignment?
[0:42:13] SPEAKER_01: And it's like those levels of the truth, which take a lot of subtle discernment.
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_01: And this is the whole practice is trying to recover.
[0:42:21] SPEAKER_01: Which true for you, since most of our setup
[0:42:25] SPEAKER_01: has been to operate from strategy rather than follow.
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that subtle knowing.
[0:42:32] SPEAKER_01: And so it's just really funny that you can practice,
[0:42:35] SPEAKER_01: especially with what Brooke said before, low stakes things
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_01: with like what would be more honest.
[0:42:42] SPEAKER_01: And you can practice with the simple things like if someone asks you how you are.
[0:42:47] SPEAKER_01: And it feels right to say, I'm kind of struggling lately, as opposed to good.
[0:42:52] SPEAKER_01: How are you? You know, or you can practice with
[0:42:55] SPEAKER_01: actually one of my old therapists, Stella Resnick,
[0:42:59] SPEAKER_01: who I loved, she's such an alive lady.
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_01: She said when she was working through her earlier childhood shame,
[0:43:07] SPEAKER_01: she used to practice saying it out loud a lot.
[0:43:10] SPEAKER_01: So if she went, I don't know, let's say she went to the grocery store
[0:43:13] SPEAKER_01: and she forgot her wallet and she was like about to pay.
[0:43:15] SPEAKER_01: She'd be like, I'm so ashamed. I forgot my wallet.
[0:43:18] SPEAKER_01: And it was just this way of practicing,
[0:43:22] SPEAKER_01: recognizing that she could experience that and say that and be in that
[0:43:27] SPEAKER_01: and not have the world fall apart around her, not have her crumble,
[0:43:31] SPEAKER_01: which is a lot of what we're afraid of.
[0:43:32] SPEAKER_01: So there's these like really small bits of low hanging fruit
[0:43:38] Unknown: where you can practice orienting towards what's honest for you.
[0:43:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And that is the path.
[0:43:47] SPEAKER_01: You know, that seems so coachy or so.
[0:43:52] SPEAKER_01: Psychology, but there's no differentiation
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_01: because it is really about you removing the obstacles to truth.
[0:43:59] SPEAKER_01: Right. And I feel like there's a way that the spiritual path
[0:44:03] SPEAKER_01: takes the psychology path as far as it can go.
[0:44:07] SPEAKER_01: And then it pierces through that veil. Right.
[0:44:09] SPEAKER_01: Because the psychological path could end at, oh, because my childhood was like this,
[0:44:14] SPEAKER_01: I'm the kind of person that is like this.
[0:44:16] SPEAKER_01: But that can be more about an identity than a true flavor.
[0:44:19] SPEAKER_01: So it just takes you into that inquiry of like, is that true? Right.
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_01: And then I just want to put in a bid that Vanessa and I also really love boundaries.
[0:44:29] SPEAKER_01: So while living from truth is not garbage dumping,
[0:44:33] SPEAKER_01: it's also not taking off your skin where you have to.
[0:44:37] SPEAKER_01: If someone says, how are you doing today?
[0:44:38] SPEAKER_01: Well, I have to tell them I'm really struggling.
[0:44:41] SPEAKER_01: No, you can like, let's say my mother asks me, how are you doing?
[0:44:44] SPEAKER_01: And I'm really struggling.
[0:44:44] SPEAKER_01: But I know if I tell my mother, I'm really struggling.
[0:44:46] SPEAKER_01: She's not going to sleep for the next two nights.
[0:44:48] SPEAKER_01: And she's going to make me crazy about what's going on in my life.
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_01: I'm allowed to draw a boundary and say, I'm pretty good.
[0:44:53] SPEAKER_01: How are you? That would be like a.
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_01: But there will be the discernment, because I would be keeping track of that
[0:44:58] SPEAKER_01: in myself instead of like, oh, I'm I'm drawing a boundary for myself
[0:45:03] SPEAKER_01: by choice, by telling my mother that because that would be actually true to you.
[0:45:08] SPEAKER_01: Exactly. As opposed to what's not to expose your skin.
[0:45:11] SPEAKER_01: You have to leak out towards my mom and then deal with all the fallout
[0:45:15] SPEAKER_01: about her anxiety.
[0:45:17] SPEAKER_01: So I'm keeping track in myself.
[0:45:19] SPEAKER_01: I am following truth, which is a boundary.
[0:45:22] SPEAKER_01: So just to put out a little.
[0:45:23] SPEAKER_01: That's the subtle refinement.
[0:45:26] SPEAKER_01: There is layers of refinement.
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mean admitting everything about yourself in every moment.
[0:45:32] SPEAKER_01: Naked all the time.
[0:45:34] SPEAKER_01: That's right. It's following what feels true to me.
[0:45:37] SPEAKER_01: Like this feels comfortable to share with this friend.
[0:45:40] SPEAKER_01: And this doesn't feel safe to share with this friend.
[0:45:43] SPEAKER_01: That doesn't even have to be a judgment or an analysis.
[0:45:46] SPEAKER_01: It can just be whatever is true.
[0:45:48] SPEAKER_01: It's about the mystery, right?
[0:45:50] SPEAKER_01: Who knows in the mystery why that would or wouldn't be a useful
[0:45:53] SPEAKER_01: conversation to have with this person right now.
[0:45:54] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of giving yourself over to the mystery and just navigating
[0:45:58] SPEAKER_01: through the pilot of like this feels like, yes, this feels like, no, thank you.
[0:46:02] SPEAKER_01: Can I add one more thing on this conversation of trust?
[0:46:05] SPEAKER_01: That's a quote.
[0:46:07] SPEAKER_01: Trust that you can operate in the absence of the shoulds and shouldn'ts.
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_01: Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_01: And then you get to notice how much of your day is made up of the shoulds
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_01: and the shouldn'ts.
[0:46:20] Unknown: Well, everything.
[0:46:22] SPEAKER_01: I know it's fucking insanity
[0:46:25] SPEAKER_01: because I should be like this.
[0:46:27] SPEAKER_01: I shouldn't be like that.
[0:46:28] SPEAKER_01: I should share with that person.
[0:46:30] SPEAKER_01: That person would feel so good if they heard that's all they really wanted
[0:46:33] SPEAKER_01: was to get intimate with me.
[0:46:34] SPEAKER_01: So I should do that.
[0:46:35] SPEAKER_01: Or my friend called.
[0:46:37] SPEAKER_01: I should respond to me.
[0:46:38] SPEAKER_01: They're they're wanting, you know, my attention right now.
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_01: And that's the nice thing to do.
[0:46:43] SPEAKER_01: And I shouldn't care that somebody like did this to me.
[0:46:47] SPEAKER_01: I should be a compassionate person.
[0:46:50] SPEAKER_01: It's the dominant thought stream is loaded with shoulds and shouldn'ts.
[0:46:57] SPEAKER_01: So, again, to take some of the examples,
[0:47:00] SPEAKER_01: let's say just even with your hands, what was happening,
[0:47:03] SPEAKER_01: it'd be very easy to say, I should keep working, though,
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_01: because so and so really needed me this week.
[0:47:08] SPEAKER_01: Their back was really hurting.
[0:47:10] SPEAKER_01: Or I have bills to pay and I have a child to support, so I should do it.
[0:47:15] SPEAKER_01: That is the the most common movement of our mind
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_01: and of our thought stream is to should and shouldn't.
[0:47:24] SPEAKER_01: And why we face this, I don't know, because I was just telling Brooke
[0:47:28] SPEAKER_01: yesterday, you guys, I'm like, sometimes I'm afraid
[0:47:32] SPEAKER_01: of letting go of my ego strategies.
[0:47:34] SPEAKER_01: Like, who would I be?
[0:47:36] SPEAKER_01: You know, what am I going to be just this like empty blob?
[0:47:38] SPEAKER_01: Or am I going to just be this like insane person
[0:47:42] SPEAKER_01: that can't have a business and can't be married?
[0:47:46] SPEAKER_01: And I don't know.
[0:47:47] SPEAKER_01: These fears are so weird and sort of irrational and yet so present.
[0:47:52] SPEAKER_01: And here I have all this fear.
[0:47:55] SPEAKER_01: And yet the moments I live without shoulds and shouldn'ts,
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_01: delightful moments, I know, like the most yummy,
[0:48:05] SPEAKER_01: cherished things you all can think back, like walking, like hiking on a mountain
[0:48:09] SPEAKER_01: or talking to a dear friend or sitting like with a book
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_01: and some cozy place or meditating, you know, whatever your moments are.
[0:48:17] SPEAKER_01: But we all have these moments of real sanity where there's not a should
[0:48:21] SPEAKER_01: or a shouldn't and there's not a self analysis and there's not a conflict
[0:48:26] SPEAKER_01: with what is there's this real immersion into direct experience.
[0:48:33] Unknown: And it's. Wonderful.
[0:48:35] SPEAKER_01: And even if it's, you know, I saying also to you,
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_01: Brooke, before like, yeah, there are some truths that don't have that yummy ring,
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_01: because most of the time, truth feels like relief to me.
[0:48:45] Unknown: But sometimes, like when I realized how much was still kinked in my system,
[0:48:50] SPEAKER_01: that truth felt like a disaster, you know, hard realizations.
[0:48:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And it was, you know, so there is that.
[0:49:00] SPEAKER_01: But it's nice to remember that all of these things we're afraid of,
[0:49:03] SPEAKER_01: like if I was to let go of my shoulds and shouldn'ts, I'd be some kind of a mess
[0:49:07] SPEAKER_01: of a human being that would be wreaking havoc or blobbing into nothing
[0:49:11] SPEAKER_01: and contributing nothing.
[0:49:13] SPEAKER_01: And no one would want to be in relationship with me.
[0:49:15] SPEAKER_01: That fear stream is the most untrue thing I can connect with.
[0:49:21] Unknown: Yeah. Yet it's there.
[0:49:25] SPEAKER_01: But contact direct experience, that's not at all.
[0:49:28] SPEAKER_01: And that's why it's good for me to have tracked that in myself,
[0:49:31] SPEAKER_01: like having that revelation, like, oh, my God, I'm so delightful.
[0:49:35] SPEAKER_01: I really am.
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_01: And then seeing it in teachers that it's like these people have had direct
[0:49:40] Unknown: realization and they're lovely to be around.
[0:49:45] SPEAKER_01: They're really sane, too. Guess what?
[0:49:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, very sane because they're not running all the static
[0:49:51] SPEAKER_01: that keeps you from saying, keeps you from reality.
[0:49:56] SPEAKER_01: And one of the main things they're lacking is the shoulds and shouldn'ts,
[0:49:59] SPEAKER_01: right, that they have to be something or that life has to be a certain way.
[0:50:03] SPEAKER_01: That's the whole thing, right?
[0:50:05] SPEAKER_01: It's lacking the this this identification with the way the world has to be.
[0:50:10] SPEAKER_01: The universe has to be benevolent and it has to be like manifestation
[0:50:14] SPEAKER_01: where I put a positive thought out and it comes back.
[0:50:16] SPEAKER_01: And when that's not happening, then I have to be a bad person.
[0:50:19] SPEAKER_01: Like all of these setups that we have
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_01: is the ultimate thing that they're lacking.
[0:50:25] SPEAKER_01: And then when you contact them, it's like, holy crap, you are so sane.
[0:50:31] SPEAKER_01: I want more.
[0:50:32] SPEAKER_01: It's why people want to be around people who've tasted this kind of direct
[0:50:36] SPEAKER_01: experience, because it's a gateway for them to remember and trust.
[0:50:40] SPEAKER_01: This is good. Yeah, this is OK.
[0:50:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, the only thing that says it's scary is the thing that's scared.
[0:50:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Is the problem mechanism.
[0:50:52] SPEAKER_01: Right. And there's something by resisting the truth underneath that.
[0:50:56] SPEAKER_01: That is just
[0:50:58] SPEAKER_01: and navigating life through direct experience and moving towards the truth
[0:51:03] SPEAKER_01: and moving away from all the shoulds and shouldn'ts and.
[0:51:07] SPEAKER_01: That just direct being.
[0:51:11] SPEAKER_01: It's a trust fall, which, of course, sounds scary.
[0:51:16] SPEAKER_01: But in the end, you're caught by life because we're we're not separate from life.
[0:51:20] SPEAKER_01: We are life. It's just that we have this funny idea that we're separate from life.
[0:51:24] SPEAKER_01: And so if I the separate thing, trust falls,
[0:51:27] SPEAKER_01: what is the other separate thing that's there to catch me?
[0:51:29] Unknown: And it's like, no, it's all just life.
[0:51:33] SPEAKER_01: God, it's so funny, the separate thing,
[0:51:35] SPEAKER_01: like even that conversation of how we're talking to ourselves in our brain,
[0:51:39] SPEAKER_01: like we're two separate people, like there's two of us there,
[0:51:41] SPEAKER_01: the one to talk and the one to listen. Yeah.
[0:51:43] SPEAKER_01: And it always is like that.
[0:51:45] SPEAKER_01: That's why we had done coaching with our coach earlier.
[0:51:47] SPEAKER_01: I loved him as a human being, but he used to make you do this, like
[0:51:51] SPEAKER_01: dialectic journaling, where you would talk to parts of yourself like.
[0:51:55] SPEAKER_01: And it was useful sometimes to unearth things as journaling always can be,
[0:51:59] SPEAKER_01: because it's a process of self-reflection.
[0:52:00] SPEAKER_01: But just that division. Yes.
[0:52:02] SPEAKER_01: Like the emphasis of the division that there's a listener and a listener,
[0:52:06] SPEAKER_01: you know, and that your thoughts are telling you something worth listening to.
[0:52:09] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like all of that is actually creating more insanity than
[0:52:13] SPEAKER_01: sanity at a certain point. But.
[0:52:17] SPEAKER_01: Anyway, speaking of listening,
[0:52:20] SPEAKER_01: I don't know if you have anything more you want to say,
[0:52:21] SPEAKER_01: but one thing I was thinking I'd like to bring forward before we end it
[0:52:25] SPEAKER_01: and kind of wrap it up is
[0:52:29] SPEAKER_01: just that simplicity of Adia saying that listening is the orientation.
[0:52:34] SPEAKER_01: Right. So let's say, OK, what's our aim is truth.
[0:52:38] SPEAKER_01: Right. And that has to just be a natural calling.
[0:52:42] SPEAKER_01: It's a natural calling for Brooke and I as towards truth.
[0:52:45] SPEAKER_01: And for many of you, that may be the case.
[0:52:47] SPEAKER_01: And then, OK, so how do I get how do I point myself in that direction?
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_01: Well, I trust life. That's a big part of it. Right.
[0:52:54] SPEAKER_01: And we've given a couple of ways you tune into your body.
[0:52:58] SPEAKER_01: You follow your gut instincts. You listen for the still small voice.
[0:53:02] SPEAKER_01: You practice being honest in your choices and in your words.
[0:53:06] SPEAKER_01: OK, all of these things.
[0:53:07] SPEAKER_01: And he said, and the orientation to take along with you is listening.
[0:53:12] SPEAKER_01: So that's the attitude. It's the movement is I'm going to listen.
[0:53:16] SPEAKER_01: The more you listen, the more truth becomes apparent.
[0:53:19] SPEAKER_01: It's just the way it goes.
[0:53:21] SPEAKER_01: It's like building a muscle. Right.
[0:53:23] SPEAKER_01: And that's, I think, what we were talking about earlier, like these.
[0:53:26] SPEAKER_01: How do I live more in alignment with my truth is like this whole process,
[0:53:31] SPEAKER_01: because you have to build the muscle of how to listen and discern. Yes.
[0:53:35] SPEAKER_01: What is in alignment for me?
[0:53:37] SPEAKER_01: So I thought that was just really lovely.
[0:53:38] SPEAKER_01: And it's like, if you keep listening, you can't go off like eventually.
[0:53:43] SPEAKER_01: You'll always come back into alignment if there's that
[0:53:46] SPEAKER_01: what I do called level of sincerity. Yes.
[0:53:49] SPEAKER_01: Don't worry so much.
[0:53:50] SPEAKER_01: You'll always come back if you're sincere in listening for truth,
[0:53:55] SPEAKER_01: whether that is an embodiment practice where you're listening to the body
[0:53:59] SPEAKER_01: with this careful attention or we're tuned attention, I should say,
[0:54:05] SPEAKER_01: whether it's listening to the the the way your mind works,
[0:54:10] SPEAKER_01: like this keen observation to observe the architecture
[0:54:14] SPEAKER_01: of your thought streams and your belief systems,
[0:54:17] SPEAKER_01: or whether it's listening to what's happening in the mirror of your life,
[0:54:20] SPEAKER_01: as Kieran Trace would point us towards.
[0:54:23] SPEAKER_01: It's all just listening
[0:54:26] SPEAKER_01: and attuning to your inner experience as the teacher.
[0:54:31] Unknown: Yeah. Through listening.
[0:54:35] SPEAKER_01: Amen to that.
