[0:00:19] SPEAKER_00: about the awakening spiritual path. And what does that even mean? What is a real evolution
[0:00:25] SPEAKER_00: of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? The beauty and the crazy, the
[0:00:30] SPEAKER_00: joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. So just a little update on this

[0:01:09] Unknown: curse. So if you're in non-swearing company, you may want to wear headphones. Okay, here we go.
[0:01:15] SPEAKER_01: Well, hello, Brooke. Hey, Vanessa. Oh, my gosh, it's been so long since we've recorded that,
[0:01:24] Unknown: full disclosure for you listening. I'm nervous. I know. Well, I feel like, and I feel like right
[0:01:32] SPEAKER_00: now we're living through a time where so much changes in any given day or week or whatever,
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_00: that I feel like I'm time traveling to the past. And I'm like, right, podcast Vanessa on my screen.
[0:01:44] SPEAKER_01: Yes, it's super, it's super funny. Nervous simply everyone, because it's been so long. I haven't
[0:01:51] SPEAKER_01: been speaking in public in so long. And so here we are. And Brooke, it's about our four-year
[0:01:58] SPEAKER_00: anniversary. I know. We looked at that right before we started, because we couldn't remember
[0:02:02] SPEAKER_00: our three years, four years, five years, and we're just about at exactly four years. Yeah. So it's
[0:02:08] SPEAKER_01: been a really amazing four years. And thank you all, so many of you for listening literally that
[0:02:16] SPEAKER_01: whole time. You know what that means for years? That means like what? Well over a hundred hours of
[0:02:23] SPEAKER_00: us talking. Yeah, that's a good point. I would have to look that up. It's a lot of talking. Yeah,
[0:02:30] SPEAKER_00: because we've done a hundred and something episodes. Yeah. 50, I don't know. Oh, a hundred and
[0:02:36] SPEAKER_01: something, which means over a hundred hours. And so, wow, we have had quite a bit to say over the
[0:02:43] Unknown: years, huh? Apparently, yeah. There was stuff to talk about and stuff to learn. Yeah. So everyone
[0:02:50] Unknown: listening, we wanted to share something that's really exciting and personal and sentimental for
[0:02:58] SPEAKER_01: us today, which is that this will, for now, for as far as we can see into the future, this will be
[0:03:04] Unknown: our final episode. Yeah. I'm just leaving a pause for what I imagine might be, I don't think I'm
[0:03:12] Unknown: being just self-absorbed here. I think some groans, you know. I think about all of the lovely emails
[0:03:20] SPEAKER_00: and notes, things that we've gotten even recently, as recent as yesterday. You know, I had somebody
[0:03:25] SPEAKER_00: write me and say, I've listened to every single episode of Bliss and Grit, changed my life, it
[0:03:30] Unknown: made me see patterns I'd never seen before. Can't thank you and Vanessa enough. And hearing those
[0:03:35] SPEAKER_00: things is just profound and surprising, right? Like in our reality, I'm sitting in my office closet
[0:03:43] SPEAKER_00: right now because it has the best sound when I live on a busy street. You're sitting in your guest
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_00: bedroom and like, we're friends for 15 years or so. And so hearing that from people always reminds
[0:03:55] Unknown: me like, yeah, this is having a useful impact and it lives in the world. Yeah, it's so well said,
[0:04:03] SPEAKER_01: because I feel the same way. Oftentimes you're just like, wait, huh? What me? I'm, you know,
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_01: someone's looking up to this experience or they're really savoring the words that are coming out of
[0:04:15] SPEAKER_01: our mouth. And it's such a beautiful thing. It's been one of the more touching things in my life,
[0:04:20] SPEAKER_01: I would say. And I've had a life dedicated to people. So for all of you listening, who've sent
[0:04:26] SPEAKER_01: us notes and letters and social media comments, and for all of our clients and your liberated being,
[0:04:33] SPEAKER_01: members, it's been just such an honor. We have been so touched. Well, I would say probably equally
[0:04:41] Unknown: by all of you as you may have been by us. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. You know, when Brooke and I were
[0:04:48] Unknown: talking before, we were just saying that you've heard us say this before in episodes, probably,
[0:04:55] Unknown: but who knows if you'd remember. This was a journey. I mean, when we started this, it's hard to
[0:05:03] SPEAKER_00: remember back like what the mindset was or the frame was. Yeah. Outside of, you know, it did have
[0:05:09] SPEAKER_00: that spontaneous nature of, well, we're having these conversations all the time. And we've said
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: this on the show before, but truly when we get on the phone, it's a lot like an episode. Like we,
[0:05:19] SPEAKER_00: we drop right into what we're, what thread we're following and what we're experiencing. And it just
[0:05:27] SPEAKER_00: seemed like we could have them in public and maybe people almost listening in on us having coffee or
[0:05:34] SPEAKER_00: phone conversation with each other. And selfishly, it was a way to hang out with you more because
[0:05:39] SPEAKER_00: when we started, I've been in Connecticut the whole time. Were you in Miami or? You were in Miami and
[0:05:45] SPEAKER_00: now you're in Austin. So we've been long distance this whole time. So selfishly, it's a little extra
[0:05:49] Unknown: Vanessa time for me. Um, but yeah, it's hard to remember the full frame that I had in mind besides
[0:05:59] SPEAKER_00: those core things that haven't changed when we started it. Yeah. I think it was that we didn't
[0:06:04] SPEAKER_01: want people to feel so alone on their path. We felt like we had to come together across the country
[0:06:11] SPEAKER_01: just to have the kind of conversations we were having. You know, it wasn't so readily available
[0:06:17] SPEAKER_01: right next door to us at the time. And I think also Brooke, I think it was because you and I have
[0:06:25] SPEAKER_01: always had a compass that said, stop making spirituality seem like you're escaping being
[0:06:31] SPEAKER_01: human. And I think we wanted to have conversations with real humans who have studied deeply,
[0:06:41] Unknown: practiced, you know, devotedly, but we're still having very human struggles. We didn't want to
[0:06:47] SPEAKER_01: just present the after we wanted to present the during so that, you know, at that time we were
[0:06:55] SPEAKER_01: saying really hashtag be human. Right. Just be human. Yeah. I think even at the time, you know,
[0:07:02] SPEAKER_01: when, when we started this, we were going to Dharma ocean, right? We did this five month long
[0:07:07] Unknown: meditating with the body training. That was part of where this idea was birthed. And one of the
[0:07:13] SPEAKER_01: teachers on the training fell in love with one of the students. And, you know, there was controversy
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_01: and there was drama. And it was like, right from the beginning, right from the inception of us
[0:07:22] Unknown: deepening into our path we saw, and people are just human teachers can be great. Teachers can
[0:07:29] SPEAKER_01: point the way to unseen realities and to essential nature. And they're still subject
[0:07:38] SPEAKER_01: to the conditions of being human. And so I think that was really important to us. And I
[0:07:43] SPEAKER_00: think we did a pretty good job with that part. Yeah, I sure, I sure hope so. It was definitely
[0:07:47] SPEAKER_00: what was in our hearts doing the work and what continues very much to be in our hearts is the old
[0:07:55] SPEAKER_00: just be human. Like we're never not human as long as we're in a human body. It's what we got,
[0:08:00] Unknown: you know, is the human experience as a particular person. So yeah, that was very much important
[0:08:07] Unknown: as well that we bring that forward and it felt really alive and in flow. And, and I think
[0:08:15] SPEAKER_00: what it sounded like to people is what it felt like to us, which was that it was truly a
[0:08:21] Unknown: conversation between friends, you know, that we weren't trying to posture present ourselves as
[0:08:27] SPEAKER_00: teachers. It was really just like, let's have these conversations we're always having except
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_00: record them and put them in public. And of course, there's some little frame that comes in, right,
[0:08:35] Unknown: where you're you're aware, like, who are we talking to right now, right? We're talking to
[0:08:40] SPEAKER_00: people who are listening, you're aware that we're not, I'm not the only one with you in this
[0:08:43] SPEAKER_00: conversation. But those conversations felt very alive. And I remember at some point,
[0:08:51] Unknown: I don't remember how far into the process we were. We've, it occurred to us, like a year,
[0:08:59] Unknown: at least a year in, like, oh, we're just recording our own unfolding experience. Like we're just
[0:09:08] SPEAKER_00: talking about our path, which to anyone who was listening was da, you know, but to us, it was
[0:09:13] SPEAKER_00: that's, for whatever reason, what the call is of doing this show is to be real people in public,
[0:09:21] Unknown: you know, talking about their process. And that felt really right for a long time. And I think
[0:09:28] SPEAKER_00: it served based on what I'm hearing from listeners who've contacted us. And then at some point,
[0:09:35] Unknown: you know, that, that process continued to, I don't know if deepen is the right word,
[0:09:42] Unknown: because it was always deep, but it hit layers that weren't quite so articulate. And I'm just
[0:09:49] Unknown: speaking for me in my experience. And that needed to be, I needed to be with them in that
[0:09:55] SPEAKER_00: inarticulate space, and to go really slowly, and really somatically and experientially with them.
[0:10:03] Unknown: And that continues to be the case for me. And so we had done an episode not too long ago,
[0:10:11] Unknown: what did we call it? We're talking about the river. Like, was it the one where you're letting go of
[0:10:15] Unknown: what you love? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was one we were talking about doing less frequent
[0:10:22] SPEAKER_00: episodes, we I think we wind up talking about that very little, but it was also at the time when we
[0:10:27] SPEAKER_00: were going to do less frequent episodes. And honestly, it was about that time that I think
[0:10:31] Unknown: you and I both, I don't want to speak for you, but just dropped into a different layer of experience
[0:10:39] Unknown: that no longer wanted to be about capturing it every week. And publish publishing it on a platform
[0:10:50] Unknown: every week. Yeah, for sure. You know, Matt Conn once said to me, I think I was talking to him about
[0:10:57] SPEAKER_01: confidence and stepping into teaching more again, because I had always taught in my, as I call it
[0:11:03] SPEAKER_01: prior incarnation. But it was like, you know, stress management or, you know, self help kind
[0:11:09] Unknown: of style. And I felt really comfortable with that. But, but more like what could I offer in teaching
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_01: now, you know, you and I have had such right, alive paths and stepping into the role in this moment.
[0:11:21] SPEAKER_01: And I was talking to him about my trepidations about it. And he said, you know, you will find
[0:11:28] SPEAKER_01: confidence in silence. He said, when you sit in silence enough, confidence will be born
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_01: out of that. You will know who you are essentially in the silence and, and you'll trust it. And,
[0:11:41] SPEAKER_01: and that struck a note with me, you know, you all relate, like, this is such a time of sharing,
[0:11:47] SPEAKER_01: right? I mean, it's so good. So many of us on this path, like so many of you all listening,
[0:11:52] Unknown: you're so like minded and like spirited. We we've tried to share, we've tried to be open,
[0:11:59] SPEAKER_01: we've tried to be vulnerable, because really culture wasn't built like that, at least not in
[0:12:04] Unknown: the United States, I'm sure in many places, our culture was, was built on superficial conversation,
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_01: right? And then being grossly general. So so much medicine came from going deep in and then daring
[0:12:18] SPEAKER_01: to share, like, how many vulnerability hangovers did we get? It's been four years worth of
[0:12:25] SPEAKER_00: vulnerability hangovers, and I'm sure today will be no exception. And we you know, we we didn't do
[0:12:31] SPEAKER_01: everything right. There were things we regretted, there were mistakes we've made, there were
[0:12:36] SPEAKER_01: secrets we've shared about ourselves that we talk about with literally nobody in our personal lives.
[0:12:43] SPEAKER_01: Yes, my husband still doesn't listen. So he's missed out on details that you all have.
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_01: And we've had many a vulnerability hangover. And it's been powerful, actually very healing,
[0:12:56] SPEAKER_01: because sometimes going through a process that's humbling is so invite so much of you forward,
[0:13:02] SPEAKER_01: it's really so powerful. But also, there is power to be gained in in going inward and coming into
[0:13:10] SPEAKER_01: some silence and, you know, letting your process have its own life without any stimuli, without any
[0:13:19] SPEAKER_01: feedback. And that's really where you and I both happened to land. And, you know, we've always
[0:13:26] SPEAKER_01: operated intuitively, you all know that about us, we started it intuitively, we barely remember why,
[0:13:33] SPEAKER_01: we're ending it intuitively, we're just learning why after already wanting to end it, right?
[0:13:40] SPEAKER_01: As it goes. But certainly part of it is, we were no longer called to share our private process. And
[0:13:48] SPEAKER_01: we were like, should we pivot? Didn't quite feel right. It was just like, okay, sometimes it's time
[0:13:56] Unknown: to close a door. And, you know, follow whatever that alive impulses. Yeah. Yeah. So that said,
[0:14:06] SPEAKER_00: maybe we can share a little bit of the alive impulse as it currently is.
[0:14:11] SPEAKER_00: So you go first. What feels alive and juicy to you right now?
[0:14:17] Unknown: You know, so funny, so quiet. I mean, God, this has been for all of us, like, let us just acknowledge
[0:14:25] SPEAKER_01: the times we're in, right? Historical times, really historical times. And
[0:14:30] SPEAKER_01: so being silent has been new for me. I mean, if any of you were on our social media, I've been
[0:14:36] SPEAKER_01: running that and I am talking, talking, talking always out in public. And so it's been really
[0:14:44] SPEAKER_01: a delight to challenge my own first technology addiction that I know I have. But if you're on
[0:14:50] SPEAKER_01: social media enough, like you might want to check in, you might be, you might be falling into that
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_01: too. So, so that was really lovely. And getting quiet has been lovely. Oh my God. I mean, I'm
[0:15:05] SPEAKER_01: verbose and I've been a public figure for a while now, four years. And, and I was teaching before
[0:15:12] Unknown: that to build my business. So it's been really fun to be quiet and, and deeply reflective and
[0:15:22] SPEAKER_01: deeply reflective and introspective. And then I would say, Oh my God, in typical
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_01: Vanessa fashion, my love for the mystical and unseen has only grown, only deepened and widened.
[0:15:41] SPEAKER_01: So it's like, you know, really deepening my exploration around energy and the body.
[0:15:49] Unknown: Um, like I was saying to you before, Brooke, like I am obsessed. Okay. One day I was sitting
[0:15:55] Unknown: and meditating and I just got this clear thing. Like everyone talks about how we are the light,
[0:16:02] SPEAKER_01: like, are we, what does that mean? And you know, I'm down a rabbit hole on it. I know the concept,
[0:16:09] SPEAKER_01: I can get it intellectually. I can get it from spiritual lingo, but like, what would that mean?
[0:16:15] SPEAKER_01: Are we really energy bodies? And you know, we've had so many great people we've interviewed on that.
[0:16:22] SPEAKER_01: You and I both believe in it, but to allow myself to go tripping down the rabbit hole of like,
[0:16:31] SPEAKER_01: how the cells are biofotonic and what does that mean? And what does sound vibration do to the
[0:16:37] SPEAKER_01: cells and what is our DNA? And what does it mean when people say DNA activation? And can we
[0:16:43] SPEAKER_01: activate some kind of what the mystics would call divine blueprint? So this stuff has me
[0:16:51] Unknown: ever fascinated my meditations or like that. I'm doing yoga. I haven't done yoga in years. Like
[0:16:59] SPEAKER_01: it's been just not calling to me, but I started doing yoga with Dr. Sue, like the Egyptian cell
[0:17:05] Unknown: yoga and I'm in love with it. I mean, I am in love with feeling into my body in a whole new way.
[0:17:13] Unknown: This kind of visceral power coming in a new way. I think that was one of the things I realized,
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_01: you know, one of the revelations I've had about myself recently was, wow, you know,
[0:17:27] SPEAKER_01: embodying power has never felt particularly safe to me. And that may not be obvious from the outside.
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_01: You don't know how people perceive you, but from the inside. And that's for reasons in my life and
[0:17:40] SPEAKER_01: my childhood and everything, but recovering a sense that I can trust in my own viscerality
[0:17:47] SPEAKER_01: and strength and agency and you could call it power, you know, is been super fun. So I've been
[0:17:57] SPEAKER_01: really into that. Like what does it look like for all of us to take back our own agency,
[0:18:04] SPEAKER_01: our own sovereignty, you know, moving from codependence, not to independence,
[0:18:10] SPEAKER_01: because I think that's a Western ideal that's created totally its own pathology, right?
[0:18:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Cult of individualism. Yeah.
[0:18:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. But to interdependence, like what does interdependence really look and feel like?
[0:18:23] SPEAKER_01: And how can we step into our agency so that we are our fullest contributors and receivers in this
[0:18:34] SPEAKER_01: hopefully beautifully new interdependent society I pray and aim to create?
[0:18:43] SPEAKER_00: Just want to let that mic drop for a second. It's beautiful.
[0:18:49] Unknown: Thanks, Annie.
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. As I'm listening to you, you know, in typical Brooke and Vanessa fashion, we're both
[0:18:56] SPEAKER_00: in completely different places for the exact same reason. Like for the exact same overarching,
[0:19:03] Unknown: let's say, heart calling, you know, which I always love about us. Yeah, like so I
[0:19:14] SPEAKER_00: I've been stepping into doing more, having more voice, doing more teaching, inviting more guest
[0:19:22] SPEAKER_00: teachers. So I run a community platform called liberated being that's an embodied practice group.
[0:19:28] SPEAKER_00: I'm running a class right now about embodying safety and capacity. And so it's actually
[0:19:32] Unknown: been super fun to like I have a lot of hiding hide to be safe programming. And I'm sure a lot
[0:19:42] SPEAKER_00: of people listening to as well. And it's it's a tough one. You feel so vulnerable doing anything.
[0:19:48] SPEAKER_00: And for a long time, like clearly I feel called to do public facing work. You know, I've been
[0:19:53] SPEAKER_00: doing this for I don't know, seven years, eight years started with liberated body.
[0:19:57] SPEAKER_00: Um, I like to teach and I like to learn and I like to do both of those things in public. So
[0:20:07] SPEAKER_00: and yet there were always these ways of not quite feeling comfortable.
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_00: Just literally building a container that says like, I would I am engaged when with this and
[0:20:22] SPEAKER_00: I'm happy to be publicly doing that, which doesn't mean at all anything to do with stepping on a
[0:20:27] SPEAKER_00: pedestal or having all the answers or all those things, which again, it's another cultural frame
[0:20:32] Unknown: about hierarchy, right, that you're, you should be in a position of leadership or making or doing
[0:20:38] SPEAKER_00: things when you've decided you deserve the hierarchical top dog position. And I don't
[0:20:43] Unknown: believe in in hierarchy thinks a lot of shit. So I could never quite, um,
[0:20:49] SPEAKER_00: you know, get the math to add up there. And then I just realized like, oh, that's just a cultural
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_00: frame that can go and then I can build something or some things that are based on this non hierarchical
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_00: exploration, which is a lot of what we did here too. You know, neither one of us were presenting
[0:21:05] Unknown: ourselves as people with answers. And I love learning from lots of different people. And at
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_00: the same time, I really realized we recently had Judith Blackstone, our teacher, creator of
[0:21:17] Unknown: realization process, one of our teachers. Um, I had her on as a guest speaker for liberated being.
[0:21:24] SPEAKER_00: And it was just, it was one of those like, it's what's right under your feet. Like
[0:21:31] Unknown: I find the realization process work around embodying your being and bringing that into
[0:21:39] Unknown: the world, how you perceive yourself and the world and how you relate to just be the most
[0:21:45] Unknown: sophisticated, beautiful embodiment work. And so it was like, I, I mean, I love to learn. I spend
[0:21:54] SPEAKER_00: a lot of time with a lot of different teachers and it's like, maybe it's just the group I already
[0:21:58] SPEAKER_00: belong to. I'm, I'm a part of the realization process people for a reason. Like I think Judith's
[0:22:04] SPEAKER_00: teachings are, they have that the rest that I really care about where like, let's not
[0:22:10] SPEAKER_00: get too interested in concepts or teach you how to monitor yourself better, which a lot of self care
[0:22:16] Unknown: does, let's just help you experience something different. Um, so I've found that I'm, I'm
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_00: rededicating myself to that and just like, keep it simple. This is the work you love. It's the work
[0:22:27] SPEAKER_00: you teach. Um, so I'll be doing, I did the healing ground certification with Judith, with you,
[0:22:33] SPEAKER_00: um, which used to be called the spiritual psychotherapy training. And so I'm going to
[0:22:37] Unknown: do the meditation training this year. So fun, super fun. It's a three parter for those listening.
[0:22:43] SPEAKER_00: And then the other one is the embodiment training, which isn't happening until 2021. So I'll do that
[0:22:48] Unknown: then for 2022. I don't know. Um, so that's been really, really delightful to like grow a group
[0:22:57] SPEAKER_00: there. And the larger question that I keep realizing I'm sitting with, like you said, you're,
[0:23:02] Unknown: you're more called to the mystical, which was always your calling. And I feel like I'm more
[0:23:08] SPEAKER_00: called to like messing around with the Jenga tower of society. Like what is the bullshit
[0:23:16] Unknown: like hierarchy, like, um, perfectionism, like what is the bullshit that we
[0:23:23] SPEAKER_00: have been taught is just the way life is and what happens if we can embody something different,
[0:23:28] SPEAKER_00: which, like I said, through realization process practices is kind of where it's at for me.
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_00: Um, if we literally experience ourselves and the world differently and we're able to be
[0:23:39] Unknown: present and relating in a different way, how does that, what potential does that have for,
[0:23:45] Unknown: for building a new world? You know, like when I started liberated being, I think a tagline
[0:23:52] Unknown: or something I had put on the website was like, if you're here, if you're wanting to give birth
[0:23:58] SPEAKER_00: to a more highly conscious and more loving world, and it's like, I really, I really mean that,
[0:24:04] Unknown: you know, it's not just something to, um, aspire to like, let's do it. Let's, let's practice
[0:24:12] SPEAKER_00: embodiment and at the same time, kind of pull out some of those Jenga tower pieces of society that
[0:24:17] Unknown: aren't true so that we can both embody what we are at the same time that we're seeing what we're,
[0:24:23] Unknown: we're not. So that's really to say it's compelling for me is a, you know, the
[0:24:28] Unknown: understatement of the world. So it's felt delicious to be like, yeah, just step on in
[0:24:35] Unknown: with that. And, um, I see liberated being, which what it is now is six days a week. We do practice
[0:24:42] SPEAKER_00: together and twice a month we have guests teachers. And I see that container actually
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_00: shaping up even more, like I'm going to make it much more clear around this is, you know,
[0:24:52] Unknown: embodying a different way of being to call in the new world and to see what the old world is. So
[0:25:00] SPEAKER_00: I'm super excited about that. That's been totally delightful.
[0:25:05] Unknown: Well, and so important. I mean, yeah, now, thankfully with the systems of oppression
[0:25:12] Unknown: becoming more clear to people, thankfully more people having their eye on it. I think it's very
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_01: powerful to look at activism as having these multiple layers underneath it. I've always come
[0:25:25] SPEAKER_01: from the thought process that shifting consciousness helps shift culture helps, right? Like you have to
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_01: act, you have to do all the things, but you know, when you look at someone like Resma Menachem's
[0:25:37] SPEAKER_01: work or so many of the people you've had in liberated being, it's like embodiment shifts
[0:25:42] SPEAKER_01: consciousness and helps you live new in a world that you're creating a new. So I love that. I love
[0:25:49] Unknown: embodied activist activism as a part of it. Yeah. And that embodiment is, you know, so we can be
[0:25:55] Unknown: clear about what actions to take that aren't just perpetuating the cultural hamster wheel. Yeah,
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_00: it's really interesting. Like I was talking to a friend of mine recently and I was like, I feel
[0:26:09] SPEAKER_00: like I've spent a lot of my whole life really, actually, when I think about it, because as a kid,
[0:26:14] SPEAKER_00: my brother and I always felt very outside of what was happening in the neighborhood because it was
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_00: just filled with a lot of craziness. And so we would observe other kids our age and other parents
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_00: from this point of view of like, what's going on with these people? And so he and I had this like
[0:26:26] Unknown: little lab of like, what is society? Like, what is this? People think this is just a way to be.
[0:26:35] SPEAKER_00: So honestly, I've been that way since I was little. But I was talking to a friend recently,
[0:26:40] SPEAKER_00: and I was like, I feel like my whole life I've been like describing, you know, that old story
[0:26:44] SPEAKER_00: about describing the elephant. Like, yeah, you blindfold people and they're touching an elephant
[0:26:49] SPEAKER_00: and one can feel the trunk and like it's snake-like and long and the other has a leg and it's like, no,
[0:26:55] SPEAKER_00: it's leathery and thick and the other has a tail. And I was like, I feel like I've spent my whole
[0:27:00] SPEAKER_00: life describing an elephant. And I just finally was like, oh, it's like white Western culture is
[0:27:07] SPEAKER_00: the elephant I've been describing. Oh, and it's perfectionistic and it's narcissistic and it's
[0:27:12] SPEAKER_00: sociopathic and it obsesses over busyness and it has hierarchy. And I was like, oh my God.
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_00: So racism and oppression. Yeah, that hierarchy for needs to oppress, yeah, groups of people
[0:27:26] Unknown: because someone needs to be demarked as top of the heap. So that was interesting and continues
[0:27:34] SPEAKER_00: to be interesting. And it was just that like, oh, it's an elephant. Like I've been describing
[0:27:39] Unknown: an elephant my whole life and that's what this looks like. So that feels like a beautiful
[0:27:46] SPEAKER_00: calling for me. And then the other huge piece of my life is that my son's quasi homeschooled. We
[0:27:54] SPEAKER_00: belong to a homeschool co-op. So I'm not his teacher and he's around peers all day. And in
[0:27:59] Unknown: non-COVID times, we have a building that we go to that has a campus. But it is homeschooling in the
[0:28:05] Unknown: sense that we put together a curriculum. We hire teachers and I contribute to teaching at that school.
[0:28:14] Unknown: And it's a really exciting part of life. Again, giving birth to a new society, we're doing whole
[0:28:25] Unknown: curriculums around an actual history of the United States, told from indigenous lens,
[0:28:32] Unknown: told from black and brown lens, things that I didn't get taught in Massachusetts where we would
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_00: just go on trips to Plymouth Rock and talk about raw, raw pilgrims all the time. And I am doing a
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_00: class with them around understanding the equipment you have. Like what is your autonomic nervous system
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_00: and how do you become more conscious of the fact that you don't have to be hijacked by life and
[0:28:57] SPEAKER_00: you've got lots of options and teaching that to the teens. So it's another sort of teaching,
[0:29:02] Unknown: learning yum yum place, but also involves my favorite person, my son and his peers.
[0:29:10] Unknown: So that's another piece that's very juicy and takes up a lot of my life.
[0:29:16] SPEAKER_01: I think it's fair to say that you and I both probably wished that at some point earlier in life,
[0:29:23] SPEAKER_01: people could have offered this type of stuff to us, right? That at some point earlier in life,
[0:29:29] SPEAKER_01: someone could have helped shape us or given us tools or shown us a little extra love and
[0:29:37] SPEAKER_00: compassion, whatever, whatever told us it was okay to be human beings or just like a little heads up.
[0:29:43] SPEAKER_00: Do you know how you think it seems crazy out there? It kind of is. There's a lot of good as well,
[0:29:49] SPEAKER_00: not teaching kids to be paranoid about a terrible world, but yes, there's a lot of misaligned
[0:29:55] SPEAKER_00: values that you're watching play out. That's correct. Right. You're not crazy. It is broken.
[0:30:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. It's fascinating. I think a lot of people have that fantasy like we wish it could have come
[0:30:08] SPEAKER_01: earlier. So when we have the chance to help somebody who is younger than us or
[0:30:15] SPEAKER_01: at a tender phase of life, we're like, oh my God, please let me see if I can offer something that
[0:30:21] SPEAKER_01: will interrupt some of the suffering that happens when people don't have the tools or have a different
[0:30:30] SPEAKER_01: perspective or have basic love and compassion and belonging and all of the things we all need so much.
[0:30:37] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. So it's a big heart calling because it truly is like answering my
[0:30:44] SPEAKER_00: younger self's prayer for me. And now I get to do that with my son and his peers
[0:30:51] Unknown: and just be like, yeah, let's step out of the frame and just
[0:31:00] SPEAKER_00: be real about this and like come up with curriculums that fit and right. It's also
[0:31:04] SPEAKER_00: curriculums like math. And so it's not all stuff that's whatever, off the beaten path. But again,
[0:31:12] Unknown: what are ways that that is useful, accessible, and not just the sort of robot training to have more
[0:31:23] SPEAKER_00: cogs in the machine, spitting more cogs out for the machine by the time they finish high school
[0:31:29] Unknown: or college. Yeah. Well, that is beautiful. Yeah, it feels good. So it was fun to
[0:31:40] SPEAKER_00: look at the topography of what's alive for us. I mean, makes sense. Yeah. And also, I keep meaning
[0:31:48] SPEAKER_01: to tell you this, I have so many people that are in your group and I get to like hear all these
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: tidbits, like, oh, well, this speaker came and said this and this and I'm like, oh my God, it's so fun.
[0:31:59] SPEAKER_01: It's actually a community. Like, yeah, they're talking to each other. Oh my God, you know how
[0:32:04] Unknown: hard it is to get people to talk in a forum. It's like, and I feel like now, you know, we've even
[0:32:11] SPEAKER_01: recommended it to some clients because I think it's a time where a lot of people might be feeling
[0:32:16] SPEAKER_01: lonely. You know, maybe you're trapped at home with someone that's difficult for you to be with
[0:32:21] SPEAKER_01: all of the time. Maybe you're alone and you're feeling it. Maybe you're just an extrovert and
[0:32:26] SPEAKER_01: you're feeling alone because there's not enough contact. Or maybe you're struggling with something
[0:32:31] SPEAKER_01: that not everybody gets. And so you feel, you know, super overwhelmed by it, whatever it is. It's a
[0:32:38] Unknown: time when we could use deep community. I mean, we're in a phase of the world, we're in an experience
[0:32:50] SPEAKER_01: where so much trauma is coming up for people, right? Just obviously so with really good reason,
[0:32:57] SPEAKER_01: you know? And so having a place where people can go and have a deep conversation, like say what's
[0:33:03] SPEAKER_01: actually in their heart or what's in their mind or what they're struggling with is such a big deal
[0:33:10] SPEAKER_01: because, you know, one of the burdens of our society is you mostly deal with it really alone.
[0:33:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And that was a huge part of the intent is like, can there be a place, not Facebook,
[0:33:25] SPEAKER_00: where we can come together, it's not on Facebook, where we can come together and,
[0:33:31] SPEAKER_00: you know, actually talk about the unfolding and trying to shift our way of being, which is not
[0:33:37] SPEAKER_00: something that is a dominant cultural value. And so a lot of us do feel really alone and it helps
[0:33:45] Unknown: to not be alone in that, to be able to hear like, oh, other people, you know, feel like they,
[0:33:51] SPEAKER_00: you know, simple things, right? Like can't get out of their own head. Like we kind of all know
[0:33:55] Unknown: that's true, but it's helpful just to hear like other people can talk about those things. Or you
[0:34:01] Unknown: can be having just such a deep wellspring of pain and you can talk about it with people, but that
[0:34:08] SPEAKER_01: doesn't mean they'll get it, you know? And I think that's where it's helpful to have a community of
[0:34:13] Unknown: people who are plumbing the depths, right? Together. That's one of the things that I think
[0:34:21] SPEAKER_01: we meant to offer with the show. I assume we did, I hope we did. And I know we gave it to each other
[0:34:27] SPEAKER_01: is people who are plumbing the depths. What I've gotten over this year, just in a more integrated
[0:34:37] Unknown: way than I had before is, which is going to sound really simple, but it's deep when it happens is
[0:34:45] SPEAKER_01: you really just have to be you, right? Like you have to be you and live with the consequences of
[0:34:51] SPEAKER_01: being you, whatever that is. Maybe not everybody likes it. Maybe you'll make hard decisions, you
[0:34:56] SPEAKER_01: know, whatever that is. And in this process, we can all acknowledge that for us at the very least,
[0:35:03] SPEAKER_01: for many people listening, we're deep people, we're vertical people. And so we're always going
[0:35:10] SPEAKER_01: to be looking at the multiple layers or trying to do the work or, you know, exploring a process or
[0:35:17] SPEAKER_01: dropping into other perspectives that may not be superficially available to us. And that's just
[0:35:24] SPEAKER_01: part of who we are. It's not good. It's not bad. I think it's pretty good, you know, if I was to
[0:35:30] SPEAKER_01: label it, but if we just look at it as existence, you know, neutral existence, and that hasn't really
[0:35:38] SPEAKER_01: been the norm of our culture, people will talk about emotions, but that doesn't mean they go deep
[0:35:44] SPEAKER_01: into experience. Emotions are different. They can be very superficial. I'm pissed off. Yeah,
[0:35:49] SPEAKER_01: it's an emotion. But that doesn't mean you're sharing why or what's happening inside or what
[0:35:56] SPEAKER_01: it hurts or what you're afraid of, right? That's something that hasn't been so common
[0:36:03] Unknown: in mainstream culture. And many of us, that's what we need. And if we've tried to connect with people
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_01: in that way, it hasn't always gone well for us. And so just to have a friend or a colleague or a
[0:36:20] SPEAKER_01: place like this, you know, and there's other places, I'm sure that are like this, where
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_01: you can express the depth because that's who you are. You're a depth diver. I think that's
[0:36:32] SPEAKER_01: beautiful. And I know people are getting that out of a virtual community, which is pretty impressive,
[0:36:37] Unknown: Brooke. Yeah, thank you. And it's really sweet to hear that, you know, you know, people who are
[0:36:42] Unknown: benefiting from it. And anyone who's listening to this episode, you know, the show is ending. And
[0:36:51] Unknown: I really, I hear so often from people that they're back when we did weekly, right, looking forward
[0:36:56] SPEAKER_00: to it every week, and that it just feels like it's an integrated part of their own process. And like
[0:37:02] SPEAKER_00: they're having kind of coffee with two of their friends. And like you said, plumbing the depths,
[0:37:06] SPEAKER_00: having real, real talk. And so what I would just say with the episodes going is, you know, put out
[0:37:16] Unknown: your little spidey senses about the other people that you can attract, where you can have the if
[0:37:22] SPEAKER_00: you're not if you don't have this already, you can have these conversations, you know, that you can
[0:37:26] Unknown: keep that that flame alive outside of listening to a show and call it in, in your life. And you
[0:37:36] Unknown: know, you'd be surprised that are you noticing that maybe more people are available for right not
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_01: for that right now than maybe would have been in the past, I think there's so much happening that
[0:37:49] SPEAKER_01: people are going to different places within themselves, you know, I think in part people
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_01: are being challenged in a, in a in a way that's so intense that it's coming out. But but for many,
[0:38:00] SPEAKER_01: I think it's just been an invitation to go deeper to reflect more to get to know themselves more,
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_01: you know, all of those things are true. So that's been a beautiful thing to see, like even in just
[0:38:12] SPEAKER_01: my friend group, some people come in alive to parts of themselves that they have been explored
[0:38:18] SPEAKER_01: or conversations coming forward that may not have happened in the past. That's something that is
[0:38:25] SPEAKER_00: beautiful to me to witness. Yeah, I was joking with a friend of mine the other day that we're
[0:38:30] SPEAKER_00: living in the era of karmic, a hot house, you know, like a greenhouse filled with all these karmic
[0:38:38] SPEAKER_00: seeds. But it's like a hot greenhouse. And so the the acceleration of growth has just become so
[0:38:44] SPEAKER_00: rapid. So whatever it was or is for us as individuals, that was maybe a little ways down
[0:38:52] SPEAKER_00: the road or years down the road, it's like, Oh, nope, here it is right now. Time to time to clear
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_00: this out right now. And societally as well, you know, all those things, and I don't mean that in
[0:39:02] SPEAKER_00: a like, so then it'll just get cleared out, it's gonna be great. But like, everything's rising to
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_00: the surface. And so the ability and of course, as a white woman of privilege, who's I was able to
[0:39:13] SPEAKER_00: not notice those things. So for the people who had the privilege to not notice those things,
[0:39:18] Unknown: everything's getting pushed up to the surface. So this is karmic, karmic greenhouse time in our
[0:39:24] Unknown: personal lives in our cultural life as well. Yeah. Wow. So we've been through we've been through
[0:39:32] Unknown: a lot here, huh? Yeah. And we've been deeply loved and adored, which I've felt. And we've also been
[0:39:42] SPEAKER_01: humbled. Thank you all for writing in who've needed to write in, you know, being humbled is good. It
[0:39:49] SPEAKER_01: is good. I was just talking about this the other day with a client, like, humility, like being
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: humbled, when it happens within yourself and in a live process, like, wow, I am a human being and I
[0:40:02] SPEAKER_01: am x, y, and z doing the same thing on repeat, not capable of doing that, not exactly who I wish I
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_01: could be right now, you know, all of those things. It's a beautiful part of letting your ego get
[0:40:17] SPEAKER_01: deconstructed. Yeah, right. So that something new and and more whole some holistic more true
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: can come through. But I think being humbled is so close to humiliation, so close to shame,
[0:40:34] SPEAKER_01: that oftentimes when we do begin to feel that humbling, which can be so powerful for us,
[0:40:41] SPEAKER_01: so potent and rich, it can like slip into little shame loops. And for us in the beginning, that
[0:40:50] SPEAKER_00: was the case. Yeah, I remember lots of long conversations of like, oh, the shame, you know,
[0:40:56] SPEAKER_00: but it was a necessary and really beautiful part of, yeah, breaking down the ego. Yeah, and then
[0:41:03] SPEAKER_01: letting us have more resilience, like more capacity, more self trust, more self forgiveness to be like,
[0:41:08] SPEAKER_01: that wasn't perfect. But okay, let's get up and try again, you know, we can keep putting ourselves
[0:41:14] SPEAKER_01: forward. And, and, you know, in a way, isn't it interesting capacity grows by testing your limits,
[0:41:22] SPEAKER_01: right? Now, you can't put yourself in a complete die zone, or your capacity gets blown out, because
[0:41:28] SPEAKER_01: it's too much risk. But this show tested our capacity regularly, right, our capacity to like,
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_01: not collapse into shame or self judgment or fear or people pleasing or fun or freeze, you know,
[0:41:44] Unknown: all of the different things that can come up. So if any of you are thinking about a podcast,
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_00: highly recommended, even though it's a great personal growth tool and a great learning tool.
[0:41:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, such a great community builder. I mean, that's one of the really powerful things that we've
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_01: experienced is, you know, you talk about all this stuff. And it's like, truthfully, like you heard
[0:42:10] SPEAKER_01: us say at the beginning, you're thinking, who wants to hear this? And then all of a sudden,
[0:42:15] Unknown: like people want to hear it. And you're astonished that someone's finding value in your experience,
[0:42:24] SPEAKER_01: right? Not just in your objective knowledge, not just in your book smarts, but in your experience,
[0:42:31] SPEAKER_01: and people are finding value in your joy and your pain and your expansion and your contraction. It's
[0:42:38] Unknown: kind of a powerful, I guess it's like a powerful healing around the idea that you had to be perfect.
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, in order to be loved, you had to be some kind of superhuman in order to attract clients,
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_01: or have friends or be appreciated. I mean, one of the biggest surprises of doing this was that
[0:43:03] Unknown: people would want to work with me after hearing that I'm imperfect. Yeah. Like what? Wait, what?
[0:43:10] SPEAKER_01: Don't you just want to work with people who have all the answers? You gotta figure it out. Yeah.
[0:43:15] SPEAKER_01: And if there's like one platform I could stay on, it's like, it is the end of teachers having all
[0:43:21] SPEAKER_01: the answers as far as I'm concerned. Like, yeah, can we be done with that phase? I could reach
[0:43:26] SPEAKER_01: on that whole thing. Let's be done with that. For a very long time, because one of the gifts of
[0:43:32] SPEAKER_01: Listen Great was we had enough time with teachers to realize every single one of them was human.
[0:43:37] SPEAKER_01: Every single one of them still had some conditioning. Yeah. And we've seen enough
[0:43:42] SPEAKER_01: harm happen in spiritual communities, and of course, in the world, but just in the spiritual
[0:43:47] SPEAKER_01: communities alone to say, no one has all the answers. We're never not human. Right. And that,
[0:43:56] SPEAKER_01: in fact, there's something even more powerful by allowing yourself to be imperfect and to be human,
[0:44:05] SPEAKER_01: not only for your own experience of wholeness and truth, but additionally,
[0:44:12] SPEAKER_01: it's very validating and healing to others. Yeah. Yeah. And from the inside out perspective,
[0:44:20] Unknown: it keeps you humble. Like I was just rereading John Prendergast's book, The Deep Heart. He's
[0:44:25] SPEAKER_00: another very important mentor to me. And he's one of those people, him and Judith and a few other
[0:44:29] Unknown: people that when I'm with them, I'm like, this is what a profoundly embodied person feels like,
[0:44:39] SPEAKER_00: and then the aspirational part of me is like, maybe when I'm in my sixties, right? I will be
[0:44:45] SPEAKER_00: like this too. But I was reading a segment from his book where he was talking about how he had had
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_00: some realization and how he kind of started getting this mental narrative going about how he was there
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_00: for super important calling and he was going to be an important spiritual teacher. And that that
[0:45:00] SPEAKER_00: like passed, that sort of narcissistic tendency passed very quickly for him. But just reading
[0:45:05] SPEAKER_00: that it happened like for John too, who's one of the most humble, grounded, heart centered people
[0:45:11] Unknown: I know, it's like, yeah, that's it's important, right? To see through this story that anybody
[0:45:21] SPEAKER_00: is going to have all of the answers or be the most super important winner of the spiritual Olympics,
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_00: you know, the one with all the keys to the locks for enlightenment. Yeah, that's just not true.
[0:45:35] Unknown: Oh, yes. That is not a thing.
[0:45:40] SPEAKER_01: Deep relief. And we say that from the perspective of people who have surrendered a certain amount
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_01: of autonomy to the favor of a teacher who seemed like they knew things, they knew everything. And
[0:45:53] SPEAKER_01: so this is coming very much from, of course, personal experience as well as observation and
[0:45:59] SPEAKER_01: conversation with people. So that seems about it, Brooke. You want to talk about what's happening
[0:46:08] SPEAKER_01: for you? Like where people are going to find you? We're not gone. We're not disappearing.
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we still exist.
[0:46:14] SPEAKER_01: We are still around. I taught in Brooke's community not long ago.
[0:46:19] SPEAKER_01: You never know what we'll come up with. But what is happening for you these days? You mentioned it,
[0:46:25] SPEAKER_00: but let's just bring it home. Yeah. So liberated being is a dot community, not dot com. If you
[0:46:31] SPEAKER_00: want to go check it out. And I think actually, I haven't actually articulated this to the members.
[0:46:36] SPEAKER_00: I'll let the cat out of the bag before we surprise. I think I'm going to close it to new members mid
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_00: September and then reopen it December or January in the form of a, you know, that we're actually
[0:46:48] SPEAKER_00: going through a 10 month process that people are committed to the 10 months and that we have like
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_00: one retreat a month with guest teachers and that it goes in a specific order about like
[0:46:59] SPEAKER_00: four competencies of embodiment and how we bring that to societal change. So it's about to go
[0:47:05] SPEAKER_00: through a big shift. So if you want to get in before it closes up, that's there. And I'm doing
[0:47:12] SPEAKER_00: my embodying safety and capacity class, which isn't, you know, we're half about halfway through
[0:47:16] SPEAKER_00: more than halfway through almost. That's been lovely. I might run that again, but people can
[0:47:20] SPEAKER_00: stay in touch on the liberated being website or my personal mom, which is Brooke Thomas dot me.
[0:47:25] SPEAKER_00: I'm also still accepting new coaching clients these days for embodied coaching. So anyone who
[0:47:30] SPEAKER_00: would like some one-on-one support, whether in a like one-off form or a long-term invested form,
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_01: that is also available. You know, I should have asked you before I meant to. So we do still have
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_01: a mailing list from our blessing grit mailing list. And it seems to me like that's still a fine
[0:47:50] SPEAKER_01: place to go if you want to. And, you know, you can, you can sign up or those of you who are on it.
[0:47:57] SPEAKER_01: I think we can let people know if we're up to things. Sometimes it's just easy. They're already
[0:48:01] SPEAKER_00: on that mailing list. I meant to ask. We have a much smaller number of people on the list than
[0:48:06] SPEAKER_00: people who listen to the show. So if you want little, little updates, you can sign up there
[0:48:10] Unknown: or on our individual websites. I don't actually have a mailing list on my website. So TBD on that.
[0:48:19] SPEAKER_01: One day I will be back on social media. I'm sure that seems likely though. I have been off it for
[0:48:26] SPEAKER_01: two, I don't know, one and a half or two glorious months and it has felt really good. And so far,
[0:48:33] Unknown: every time I'm popping back on, I'm still not ready. Though I do have a feeling I'll be back
[0:48:39] SPEAKER_01: on social media to announce that this is coming out. So, right. There will be four students just
[0:48:45] SPEAKER_01: for a little bit. We'll see. You may, you may see me there. I'm not up too much right now, to be
[0:48:52] Unknown: honest. You know, Burke, you ever feel like something is ending but something new hasn't
[0:48:58] Unknown: quite begun? The still point is a real thing. I just feel so much that like, and I think it's
[0:49:06] SPEAKER_01: part of the quiet. It's like, I can't seem to speak from the old me, but I'm not quite ready to
[0:49:11] SPEAKER_01: speak from the new me, so to speak. You know, like there's a transitional experience happening. So
[0:49:18] SPEAKER_01: I'm excited to see who I wind up being and what winds up coming out of my mouth these days. I
[0:49:24] SPEAKER_01: felt compelled to write again for the first time in like months, a week ago. So we'll see. But right
[0:49:31] SPEAKER_01: now I'm actually just, I see my clients, which is amazing. It takes a lot to stay sane these days
[0:49:39] SPEAKER_01: and just be like really balanced for the people that you work with. And so I do that. That's
[0:49:45] SPEAKER_01: wonderful. And, and I don't know, but I am sure y'all will hear from me. Feel free to stay in
[0:49:51] SPEAKER_01: touch. My website is VanessaScotto.com. We'll just put all this in the resources. I think that seems
[0:49:57] SPEAKER_01: logical. And, and you'll find us on social media. I'll be there sooner or later.
[0:50:02] SPEAKER_01: Someday, maybe. We're not. Whatever. Definitely not Facebook. So go ahead on over to Instagram.
[0:50:08] Unknown: Not Facebook. Yeah. And, and you can find me there. And, and I think it's just fair to say
[0:50:15] Unknown: we can kind of wrap up. It has been one of the funnest things to do this with you, Brooke.
[0:50:20] SPEAKER_01: Totally. Informative, fun, inspirational, challenging, pushed all our edges. We could
[0:50:28] SPEAKER_01: figure out technology. We, I mean, every time we interviewed a teacher, I was like,
[0:50:34] SPEAKER_01: no, there was always something that was going to go wrong. I was sick to my stomach and,
[0:50:40] SPEAKER_01: and I've grown the most and I've learned the most. I don't even feel like the same person I was
[0:50:46] SPEAKER_00: when I started. I feel like a completely different person. And I think that that's
[0:50:53] SPEAKER_00: probably the top thing that was sweetest about this is that it was a genuine,
[0:50:56] SPEAKER_00: almost unintended, but, but genuinely a healing container. You know, and we've come out the other
[0:51:02] SPEAKER_00: side, different people, you know, and in our next healing container, right. Or like,
[0:51:07] Unknown: maybe I wouldn't say healing, but evolving, shifting, living container, right. Yeah. It's
[0:51:15] Unknown: been really potent, I would say. Transformative. Absolutely transformative. Thank you all so much
[0:51:26] SPEAKER_01: for listening to us, for sharing with us, for being with us, honestly, for loving us so much.
[0:51:33] SPEAKER_01: We have gotten so much affection from so many of you and it really has meant the world to us.
[0:51:41] SPEAKER_01: We can't wait to continue to get to know all of you and, and be with all of you in whatever form
[0:51:46] Unknown: life, life opens that up in. Yeah. Thank you so much. It's meant, it's meant the world to me and
[0:51:52] Unknown: to both of us.
