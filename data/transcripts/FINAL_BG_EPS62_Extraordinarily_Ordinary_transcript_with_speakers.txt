[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Brooke Thomas and I will be
[0:00:11] SPEAKER_00: joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Scotto. On the show, we're talking
[0:00:16] Unknown: about being on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is
[0:00:21] SPEAKER_00: a real evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and crazy,
[0:00:26] SPEAKER_00: the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life? Today, we're talking
[0:00:32] SPEAKER_00: about how extraordinary it is to come home to our ordinariness. One of my favorite Ch√∂gyam
[0:00:39] SPEAKER_00: Trang Parimbishe quotes is, we have to be willing to be completely ordinary. In a culture
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_00: where the goal is always to become extra special, more unique, more successful, or just generally
[0:00:52] SPEAKER_00: to strive towards being a somebody in the world, it's worth pondering what the true
[0:00:57] SPEAKER_00: gifts are of allowing yourself to rest in your ordinariness. How does our resistance
[0:01:03] SPEAKER_00: to our ordinariness tie into our stories of lack about how we're not good enough, not
[0:01:07] SPEAKER_00: worthy enough, how we only exist if we are proved of? What if that fell away? You'd
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_00: probably land somewhere quite ordinary and also ironically, at the exact same time, somewhere
[0:01:19] Unknown: totally nourishing and even miraculous. As we head towards New Year's and the resolution-making
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_00: season, maybe this year we can make a resolution to embrace our divine human ordinariness.
[0:01:32] SPEAKER_00: If you're enjoying the show, you can leave a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page,
[0:01:36] SPEAKER_00: which is Bliss and Grit. You can also head over to the website, which is blissandgrit.com,
[0:01:40] SPEAKER_00: to subscribe. We have a weekly digest of the resources that we're currently loving, so
[0:01:46] Unknown: that goes out each week on Friday. We are going to be off now for the two weeks over
[0:01:53] SPEAKER_00: Christmas and New Year's, so sorry to leave you guys hanging without an episode for a
[0:01:57] SPEAKER_00: while, but then we'll be back with much goodness and in full force for 2018. And of course,
[0:02:04] SPEAKER_00: the last warning before the conversation, if you're new here, we swear, so if you're
[0:02:08] SPEAKER_00: in mixed company, you may want some headphones. Okay, here we go.
[0:02:14] Unknown: Hello, Vanessa. Hello, my love. All righty, so this week, something that's really up for
[0:02:23] SPEAKER_00: me in a very satisfying way, like I'm hitting a beginning of an unfolding sweet spot on
[0:02:29] SPEAKER_00: this one, is something that we've talked about just a teensy bit in the past, which
[0:02:34] SPEAKER_00: is ordinary. So there's this great Trungpa Rinpoche quote about the path, the spiritual
[0:02:43] SPEAKER_00: path, and he says, we have to be willing to be completely ordinary, which is such an interesting
[0:02:49] SPEAKER_00: thing. And I was actually talking with somebody the other day who was kind of questioning,
[0:02:55] SPEAKER_00: like, why am I on a spiritual path anyway? It's not like I need to be extra special.
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, that's interesting that we correlate being on a spiritual path. And I
[0:03:06] SPEAKER_00: think we see this a lot as a more, you know, becoming more, becoming greater than. And
[0:03:12] SPEAKER_00: it's a very common spiritual bypass, you know, that if I become more awake or more
[0:03:18] Unknown: spiritual or whatever, then I that I am somehow attaining a certain kind of special or elevated
[0:03:26] SPEAKER_00: status. And to be honest, we just do this in every category of life in our culture,
[0:03:34] SPEAKER_00: that the only way that anything is valid is if it makes you extra special. And that sort
[0:03:42] Unknown: of the most loathed thing to be would be to be ordinary, which I find really fascinating
[0:03:50] SPEAKER_00: because in myself, I have definitely been someone like one of the ways that I spin off
[0:03:58] SPEAKER_00: and create, let's say, challenging karma or challenging circumstances in my life historically,
[0:04:05] Unknown: is that I go after these large, unwieldy projects. So I'm going to build or like I talked about
[0:04:20] SPEAKER_00: when my son was an infant many years ago, I'm going to say I'm going to start this online
[0:04:24] SPEAKER_00: business. I didn't have any online business before that, right? But like, that's what
[0:04:27] SPEAKER_00: the special people do. They start online businesses. And it's going to, you know, curate artisanal
[0:04:33] SPEAKER_00: foods from all over the United States and ba ba ba ba ba. And I did this for a while.
[0:04:39] SPEAKER_00: And I've, I have this tendency to grasp towards those kinds of projects. And the things that
[0:04:45] SPEAKER_00: I actually wind up making and doing are in alignment for me. And certainly I learned
[0:04:50] Unknown: some hard lessons from that particular project. And now I'm at this stage where I'm really,
[0:05:00] SPEAKER_00: really contented with the ordinary things in my life, I still make things here we are
[0:05:07] SPEAKER_00: doing bliss and grit. But I make things from a place of contentedness. And I just as much
[0:05:14] SPEAKER_00: enjoy everything ordinary, because ordinary is what's happening in any present moment,
[0:05:19] SPEAKER_00: right? So the grasping at something superhuman or extra special is usually down the road
[0:05:25] Unknown: when I acquire the extra special thing. And it seems like, I mean, in the way that it's
[0:05:32] SPEAKER_00: presented, right, in the way that we all turn our backs on the word ordinary, seems like
[0:05:37] SPEAKER_00: such a boring exploration, like we immediately go like, oh, it's so boring, you know, how
[0:05:43] Unknown: to, how to become more ordinary, we instantly just turn away from it. But I actually think
[0:05:50] SPEAKER_00: it's at the heart of giving ourselves full permission to be human beings. I think it's
[0:05:58] SPEAKER_00: at the heart of not making ourselves a problem of not feeding the story of not good enough,
[0:06:05] SPEAKER_00: of not feeding the story that we only exist when we are approved of, and we are only approved
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_00: of when we are the extra special one. So it's like, as I dive into it, as I explore, I feel
[0:06:17] Unknown: like it's, it's in the the rot of our culture, this inability to really savor and be content
[0:06:28] Unknown: with and land in ordinary. And I remember that when I was on retreat with Kieran Trace,
[0:06:35] SPEAKER_00: we were kind of talking about the opposite of ordinary superpowers on the spiritual path,
[0:06:40] Unknown: like there's all these stories, right about people who they become clairvoyant or whatever
[0:06:45] SPEAKER_01: cities, cities, they would say exactly like yogic superpowers. Yeah, totally. And we were
[0:06:51] SPEAKER_00: talking about Adyashanti, we love very much. And I remember Kieran saying, Adya's superpower is
[0:06:58] SPEAKER_00: ordinariness. And that really landed with me. I was like, that is so great. And like, how fascinating
[0:07:05] SPEAKER_00: that we live in a time where it's a very genuine and important superpower to bring more ordinary
[0:07:14] SPEAKER_00: to the world.
[0:07:16] Unknown: So funny. I mean, it's an interesting conversation. You, you kind of pointed to what the definition
[0:07:23] SPEAKER_01: of ordinary would be as you're using it. I think we all understand the word. But to have the
[0:07:30] SPEAKER_01: conversation, we have to look at these two different concepts, right, ordinary and special.
[0:07:36] SPEAKER_01: Mm hmm.
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_01: I remember this all too well, you probably have a deeper love affair with ordinary than than I do.
[0:07:45] SPEAKER_01: I remember also studying with Dharma Ocean and Trump or Rinpoche, and the kind of energy of like,
[0:07:54] Unknown: you have to find the magic in the mundane. So if you look at this sentence, magic in the mundane,
[0:08:00] SPEAKER_01: it's like saying finding the extra specialness in the ordinary, right. And of course, I'm
[0:08:05] SPEAKER_01: like, ooh, the magic. And you're like, ah, the mundane.
[0:08:13] Unknown: But it's true. There is a magic. Yeah. Yeah. But nevertheless, that's part of what we're looking
[0:08:20] Unknown: for is that as soon as we remove this filter, or this concept, that magic only comes in extra
[0:08:32] Unknown: specialness, then we can really see it. Because it's there woven in our everyday reality. I mean,
[0:08:41] Unknown: in our present based moment to moment experience. That's where we find genuine magic, right. So I
[0:08:53] Unknown: remember, though, this history of special for me. And I probably still have a little bit of
[0:09:04] Unknown: pain body wiring around this. I was probably in my 20s. And since I've always been in this field in
[0:09:14] SPEAKER_01: some way, shape or form, I was a Chinese medicine doctor. But, you know, by the time I was in my
[0:09:19] SPEAKER_01: late 20s, I was already life coaching. And then I was going to school for spiritual psychology
[0:09:23] SPEAKER_01: and all this stuff that you and I were already teaching. Brooke and I were already teaching
[0:09:28] SPEAKER_01: women's empowerment together when we were like, in our late 20s. And I thought that in order to
[0:09:37] SPEAKER_01: have a meaningful life, I had to be up on stage in front of 10s of 1000s of people. Right. And that
[0:09:45] SPEAKER_01: was meaningful. It's funny, I almost remember thinking this was really my ex husband's logic
[0:09:52] SPEAKER_01: at the time, I do not think it is his logic anymore. But his logic was something like,
[0:09:59] SPEAKER_01: when we would talk about having children like, well, you can either have a kid or you can help
[0:10:03] Unknown: like hundreds of 1000s of people with your time. It is not his logic. He has a kid who is like the
[0:10:12] SPEAKER_01: sunshine of his life. And I think he thinks parenting is the most important and beautiful
[0:10:17] SPEAKER_01: thing in the whole wide world now. However, I remember kind of buying into it, I was young
[0:10:22] SPEAKER_01: and impressionable. He was 12 years older than me. But there was sort of this right like, well,
[0:10:27] SPEAKER_01: then why would I want to have this ordinary experience of parenthood, when I can have this
[0:10:32] SPEAKER_01: extraordinary experience of helping hundreds of 1000s of people because then, and only then
[0:10:40] Unknown: would I be meaningful and significant. And would life be meaningful? In some ways,
[0:10:47] SPEAKER_01: I think some of it came with maturity, probably some of it came with healing,
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_01: the desire to get up on stage and help 1000s of people and like look at that as the piece
[0:11:00] Unknown: de la resistance has fallen away, like just sort of dropped. But it's funny how often people say
[0:11:07] SPEAKER_01: to me that that is their dream. Yeah, like, well, I have to be helping 1000s of people. It's my
[0:11:14] SPEAKER_01: calling I meant for it like it's insignificant if I'm not, you know, so and so has more numbers than
[0:11:20] Unknown: me. Like, this is so ubiquitous. So I've seen it in myself, I hear it around me. It's a pretty
[0:11:30] SPEAKER_01: popular conversation, I think in today's day and age, especially with the concept of famous being
[0:11:36] Unknown: so cherished by younger generations now. But it kind of boiled down to me for this like really
[0:11:44] Unknown: simple thing where inside I felt insignificant. Yeah, I just wanted to be seen as special by
[0:11:51] Unknown: somebody. I wanted to, I think it has a few threads, even in my intimate relationship.
[0:12:00] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes I've seen this kind of wound surfacing, where I'm like, am I special enough for you?
[0:12:06] SPEAKER_01: You know, like special, you want to be chosen, like I'm your soulmate, and I'll always be your
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_01: soulmate. And there's never anyone like me, right? You know, how often we have that desire, which is
[0:12:15] SPEAKER_01: like, kind of funny, because the heart is so open, we can actually love a lot of people,
[0:12:20] SPEAKER_01: right at once. And that never takes away the value of any of the people that we love. But there's
[0:12:25] SPEAKER_01: this like, I want to be your soulmate forever. Never, you never loved anyone like me, and you
[0:12:29] Unknown: never will. You know, kind of energy, right? So I would see some of that kind of need for specialness
[0:12:38] Unknown: arise in my intimate relationships, which possibly was linked to being the youngest child and
[0:12:45] Unknown: feeling a little unspecial, like a little, it's funny, I know the youngest could be seen as special,
[0:12:49] Unknown: but like, not as cool or interesting or hip as my sisters. And then there's this other piece where
[0:12:58] Unknown: this is a little harder to put into words, but maybe because I didn't feel like I could take up
[0:13:05] SPEAKER_01: space to exist and energetically didn't know how to work with being in my own body and present,
[0:13:13] Unknown: I always felt like I didn't make an impact. Like I couldn't feel my impact. And another word we could
[0:13:22] Unknown: use to relate to impact would be significance. Like if I can't impact you, if I can't be in my
[0:13:30] SPEAKER_01: body in this reality, in this present moment, I'm nothing but a shadow or a projection, how could I
[0:13:35] Unknown: leave a mark, right? It's like I can't leave an impression by putting my hand in the sand.
[0:13:41] SPEAKER_01: And I really felt like I didn't leave this impression in the world, which is of course,
[0:13:47] Unknown: untrue and impossible, but it was an experience I was having. And so this desire for impact and
[0:13:56] SPEAKER_01: significance that I was experiencing by saying, oh, I got to get up and help hundreds of thousands
[0:14:02] SPEAKER_01: of people and really leave my mark. And for me was in part, I think a reflection of this wounding I
[0:14:10] Unknown: had where I didn't feel like I was there and being registered by reality.
[0:14:19] Unknown: Katie Grant Yeah, it's funny because the
[0:14:23] Unknown: draw towards making a mark or being special or really establishing your significance in a
[0:14:33] SPEAKER_00: quantifiable way, I am on stage, thousands of people, all these things are hundreds of
[0:14:38] Unknown: thousands of people, bestselling book, whatever it is, it exposes actually our unworthiness
[0:14:48] Unknown: belief system, you know, that we're not good enough, we're not just as we are worthy,
[0:14:59] Unknown: we have to do something extra special. And I think you're also pointing out the way that this
[0:15:05] Unknown: can come out of feeling that you don't exist. And in our culture, we do a lot of letting people know
[0:15:16] Unknown: they exist by approving of them as extra special. And if they if they don't do that, they literally
[0:15:27] Unknown: are just the like vapor, right? The way they're treated culturally, the way we're all conditioned
[0:15:33] Unknown: in this container that believes that. And so it becomes a certain kind of fighting for your life
[0:15:40] Unknown: to be extraordinary. Because you don't have a life. If the out there isn't reflecting back to you,
[0:15:51] Unknown: we like it, we give you the gold star of approval, then you can feel just like vapor. So
[0:15:59] SPEAKER_00: an interesting little, you know, twist in this conversation is how do we give it to ourselves?
[0:16:06] SPEAKER_00: How do we give our existence to ourselves? You know, if we can leave aside words like mundane
[0:16:12] Unknown: and ordinary, which I understand we're also culturally repulsed by, or at least like turned
[0:16:19] Unknown: off by, can we look at how do we give to ourselves a really genuine and profound knowing
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_00: of our existence, and our value and our worth just as we are, which of course, you know, good thing,
[0:16:41] SPEAKER_00: major spiritual paths have spent thousands of years trying to help people out with this,
[0:16:46] SPEAKER_00: right? So I'm not trying to say like, what's the two sentence answer to how we can perfectly
[0:16:51] SPEAKER_00: deliver this to people. But I do think there's something very, very important in exposing that
[0:16:57] SPEAKER_00: that's the game. You know, this is what we're up against. We're up against a really genuine
[0:17:04] SPEAKER_00: not knowing that we exist without the outside world's approval. And in our outside world,
[0:17:10] SPEAKER_00: it says, you only get approval if you're super big, super important on stage, blah, blah, blah.
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_00: Which is just not going to be everybody. Why would it be like, can you imagine a more obnoxious world?
[0:17:24] SPEAKER_01: I think we're getting close to it. Yeah, we're pretty close to the tip. And of course,
[0:17:32] SPEAKER_01: you know, the part that's very tender and problematic for us as individuals, especially
[0:17:38] Unknown: highly sensitive people who can be pretty hard on themselves. If your value is being judged by how
[0:17:45] SPEAKER_01: extraordinary you are in a culture of people fighting to be extraordinary, in a culture of
[0:17:50] Unknown: people who are all different than you, you have to keep upping the game. Yeah, because everything
[0:17:55] Unknown: becomes ordinary over time. Right. And also, then how do I know? Because if today I don't get a lot
[0:18:04] Unknown: of engagement on a Facebook post, am I then failing? What about tomorrow? And how do I have to up the
[0:18:12] SPEAKER_01: game to grab your attention now? It's a really confounding dilemma. And I think you're right,
[0:18:18] Unknown: on some level, it points to our difficulty perceiving our own basic goodness. It's just
[0:18:26] Unknown: phenomenal how often it can go back to this place where we just don't recognize our place in the
[0:18:33] Unknown: cosmos. Like, just don't recognize the inherent value. It's almost like, if I was to tell you,
[0:18:44] Unknown: this tree is so special. You know, it's so beautiful. I love this evergreen. And you were
[0:18:51] SPEAKER_01: to be like, it doesn't look much different than the other evergreens. So it can't be that special.
[0:18:55] SPEAKER_01: I mean, what's it doing that's so wonderful? Like, what's it doing that's so different?
[0:18:59] SPEAKER_01: There's this way that we've mistaken what it means to be basically good, even special. Because
[0:19:07] Unknown: another word that we can use to look at special through a perhaps more useful or healthier lens
[0:19:13] Unknown: would be unique. We're all unique. Every one of us. But I think in a society that values extraordinary
[0:19:21] SPEAKER_01: and extra special, above all things, you can even feel wrong somehow, if you're unique from that.
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_01: Like, what if you're ordinary, and you don't care about those things?
[0:19:37] Unknown: Or what if I'm not an extrovert? Or what if I'm not someone who likes to be in pictures and be
[0:19:44] Unknown: someone who put myself out there? What if, like, my name is Jane, and not seven?
[0:19:55] SPEAKER_00: That's very Seinfeld of you.
[0:20:01] SPEAKER_01: It's like we were, Brooke and I had both listened to this podcast with Carolyn Mase.
[0:20:06] SPEAKER_01: We mentioned her, I think it was last week. She was on fire on a role about human nature today.
[0:20:12] Unknown: Talk. Yeah.
[0:20:15] SPEAKER_01: But one of the things that she was really on fire about was this. Everybody's got to be special
[0:20:20] SPEAKER_01: talk. You can't even name your kids anything plain anymore. It's always got to be something
[0:20:26] SPEAKER_01: you've never heard of, and comes from another culture, whatever the case is. We're almost
[0:20:31] SPEAKER_01: setting it up from the beginning, where if they can't live up to that, there's real power in the
[0:20:37] Unknown: name. We have to live up to this very special persona. You see it when parents name their kids
[0:20:44] SPEAKER_01: something special, and then it happens to catch fire in the collective. And they're so mad.
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_00: No, she was the only Penelope, and now suddenly they're everywhere.
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_01: We're just laughing at our own humanity. As Jeannie Zandi would say, mercy to the humans.
[0:21:07] SPEAKER_01: I am not beyond this. I can see within myself. Of course, I have a desire to feel special.
[0:21:14] SPEAKER_01: I suppose in some ways, it's a desire to see my own uniqueness as well.
[0:21:21] Unknown: Probably because most of the time, I felt like a misfit, even though societally, I'm probably
[0:21:29] Unknown: solidly something that one could say would fit in. My looks, my Caucasian-ness, I don't know,
[0:21:37] Unknown: my height. I'm in the majority, and yet I felt like a misfit my whole life. There was this sense
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_01: that something was wrong with me, so you're dying to know that there's something just extra good
[0:21:51] SPEAKER_01: about you. That's why you don't fit in. We can begin to create these stories. That'll explain it.
[0:21:59] SPEAKER_01: All this wounding I ever had where I was a weirdo, or I felt odd, or I felt like
[0:22:06] Unknown: how I thought was somehow wrong. Well, all of that suffering could be explained if now
[0:22:13] SPEAKER_01: I am told, or I discover, or I find that I am actually just extra special.
[0:22:20] SPEAKER_01: It's like if you watch something like Harry Potter.
[0:22:24] SPEAKER_00: Right? Sure. Oh, he's the wizard. There's all this drive for him to really
[0:22:32] SPEAKER_00: accept his specialness and move towards his specialness.
[0:22:36] SPEAKER_01: Yes. He was abused, and he was in this horrible situation where he was the misfit, and he didn't
[0:22:41] SPEAKER_01: fit. Really, the reason why he never fit into that world was because he was extra special in
[0:22:47] SPEAKER_01: this amazing thing. Once he discovered that he fit into this world in such a big way,
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_01: he had so much significance. He was, in fact, the most significant person in that whole entire world.
[0:23:00] SPEAKER_01: You can see where this mythology fit with so many of us. We feel disenfranchised,
[0:23:07] Unknown: or disempowered, or somehow wrong, somehow marginalized, whatever the case may be.
[0:23:14] SPEAKER_01: And we're just dying to discover that all along the problem was we just actually were so awesome,
[0:23:21] SPEAKER_00: so special. Right. And there's this place where we perfectly
[0:23:26] SPEAKER_00: fit and thrive and are a meaningful contribution to that particular place,
[0:23:31] Unknown: like finally, the homecoming, right? Yes. What a relief that would be.
[0:23:36] SPEAKER_00: And I think that the thing we can have so much affection and compassion for is that all of us
[0:23:42] SPEAKER_00: want to feel like our existence matters, and that that's a very basic, very fundamental human drive.
[0:23:50] Unknown: So in the dualistic way, people can take this conversation as a way to put themselves in a
[0:23:57] SPEAKER_00: small box. Don't think you're extra special. Don't reach for the stars. Don't decide that you need a
[0:24:03] SPEAKER_00: six-figure book deal. You should be happy with being meek and being quiet, and just sit on yourself,
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_00: and just sort of fall into this kind of depressive, mundane-ness, and just get used to it.
[0:24:19] SPEAKER_00: So the mind can get very good at putting us in this very depressive place. And shame on you.
[0:24:26] Unknown: Shame on you for wanting to grasp towards that. But really, the beautiful part is that what we
[0:24:35] Unknown: want while we're here is to really experience that we are alive. And I think that really
[0:24:43] SPEAKER_00: experiencing that we are alive comes with, and my aliveness matters. And that is true about
[0:24:53] SPEAKER_00: all things. The aliveness of all things matters, and each individual unique permutation of all
[0:25:00] SPEAKER_00: those things matters, because otherwise we wouldn't have so much diversity. So we don't need to
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: turn away from that. So as always, it becomes about navigating the in-between places instead of
[0:25:12] SPEAKER_00: swinging the pendulum to the opposite obvious extremes. And I have found, you know, as somebody
[0:25:22] Unknown: who, you know, I'm wired in a way where I did not experience that I existed so much growing up,
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_00: and I don't think that that makes me special. I think that's very common. And so one of the ways
[0:25:38] SPEAKER_00: for me that I grasped towards having the sensation that I existed and was approved of and was special
[0:25:48] Unknown: was to work towards these kind of large, complex ventures. You know, when in reality, like there's,
[0:26:01] SPEAKER_00: when I look at the reality of this one, Brooke, that I get to be, you know, thus far what I
[0:26:08] Unknown: have experienced is that I have worked in holistic health and private practice. I genuinely love that
[0:26:16] SPEAKER_00: kind of intimate one-on-one contact with people. I've done it for 20 years. It seems to be something
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_00: this one does and this one likes. I also love making things since I was a child, you know,
[0:26:29] SPEAKER_00: and that's why I went to art school and that's why I make podcasts and it's why I write. Like,
[0:26:33] Unknown: that's a genuine love. That's a genuine desire. And then it can start to get distorted and I can
[0:26:41] Unknown: make those genuine loves not good enough by trying to fire hose them into myself in a way of like,
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_00: yeah, but it needs to be bigger. It needs to be more successful. When will I know that it matters?
[0:26:54] SPEAKER_00: When will I, you know, it's like, you know, my 20 years in private practice just matter
[0:26:59] SPEAKER_00: because I felt driven to do that and it's exactly a right fit for what I'm up to in this world.
[0:27:06] Unknown: So great, you know, not once I'm seeing X amount of clients a week or, you know,
[0:27:12] SPEAKER_00: have started an enterprise with 12 other employers or employees rather or blah, blah, blah, you know,
[0:27:19] SPEAKER_00: or put it online as how to ralph yourself at home. I'm just kidding. It was never an idea.
[0:27:29] SPEAKER_00: So we still get to look at what makes us like what we notice in reality. We're up to,
[0:27:35] Unknown: we're called towards, we desire and that that's enough, you know, and at the exact same time,
[0:27:43] SPEAKER_00: all the other stuff is just as important. You know, me folding my laundry, those very,
[0:27:48] SPEAKER_00: very sweet, basic, ordinary moments are just as much about my fundamental goodness and existence
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_00: as whatever story I can tell about my work. But we've just put these hierarchies on what's
[0:28:06] Unknown: proof that we matter, you know, and it can be deeply relieving, you know, as we've pointed to,
[0:28:13] Unknown: it can be deep, deeply relieving not to feel like there's any special way you have to live your life,
[0:28:21] SPEAKER_01: but that rather, if you are in alignment, it is special, it is perfect, it is wonderful.
[0:28:30] SPEAKER_01: I know, I mean, when you think about, let's say, non duality, and the tendency that the
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_01: conversations can have to point towards oneness, right, like we're all one. So then there's nothing
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_01: special in theory about we're all one, what could possibly be special about Vanessa compared to
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_01: Brooke, you know, we're all the same. And then we start to think about the conversation as it
[0:28:55] SPEAKER_01: typically unfolds where they say, Okay, well, it's like an ocean, but then there are waves.
[0:29:00] SPEAKER_01: And each of these waves is unique. Maybe there's a part of us that has to be able to hold both of
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_01: these things at once for genuine spiritual maturity. And in fact, just to be true, just to
[0:29:15] Unknown: be in alignment with truth, which is on one level, there's no need to be special, there's nothing
[0:29:22] SPEAKER_01: special, we are all just this beautiful sea of oneness, beautiful and rich and special,
[0:29:28] Unknown: just because we are in this precious place where we exist. And at the same time, we are unique.
[0:29:36] SPEAKER_01: And it's a beautiful thing to embrace your uniqueness, because it's Brooks uniqueness
[0:29:42] SPEAKER_01: that pulls her towards writing and podcasting and creating and roughing. And it's Vanessa's
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: uniqueness that pulls her another way. And if we can understand the principle of uniqueness,
[0:29:52] SPEAKER_01: we don't have to feel all of this pain and angst when we don't look normative,
[0:29:58] Unknown: or like our friends or like our family. I think where we run into the dilemma is because we don't
[0:30:05] Unknown: feel valued, you were pointing towards this before Brooke, then this wound starts to get activated
[0:30:13] Unknown: like a hungry ghost wound, like I have to be it has to be proven to me that I'm good enough
[0:30:24] SPEAKER_01: to take up space, right, which means I have to prove that somehow I stand out as well and good
[0:30:30] SPEAKER_01: to people. So what we were starting to talk about what I liked the direction you were going in when
[0:30:38] Unknown: you're saying like, how can we how can we sit with our basic goodness and also let's not have
[0:30:44] SPEAKER_01: judgment for ourselves when we desire to be special, because it must be in some way a kind
[0:30:50] SPEAKER_01: of basic and neat desire, perhaps like I was saying, because we have to recognize our uniqueness.
[0:30:56] Unknown: But the problem is so many of us feel unseen, unloved, unvalued within our relationships and
[0:31:05] SPEAKER_01: within our lives that it's like that desire to be seen in a certain way or loved in a certain way
[0:31:13] Unknown: starts to kind of co-opt the whole thing. And it's a almost like a hunger that can't be met,
[0:31:21] SPEAKER_01: like something that can't be satiated. So then it starts to call the shots on how we see the world
[0:31:27] SPEAKER_01: and how we make choices, right? Like, everything starts to get filtered through. Am I getting
[0:31:34] SPEAKER_01: approval or am I good or am I loved or am I significant? You know, everything starts to get
[0:31:40] SPEAKER_01: filtered through that. And it kind of starts to hold us hostage, so to speak, right? It starts to
[0:31:46] Unknown: the structure starts to take over. And so I think some of what's interesting is that as we can start
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: to honestly admit this to ourselves and see these desires in ourselves, which I can see,
[0:31:58] SPEAKER_01: and not in a way that makes us bad, in a way that has a ton of love and affection for our humanity.
[0:32:04] Unknown: And then maybe even beyond that, a ton of love for ourselves and the parts of us that always felt
[0:32:11] Unknown: unseen, unvalued, unmet, unspecial, unsignificant, you know, if we can turn towards them with love
[0:32:22] SPEAKER_01: and hold it and the whole thing softens. The funny thing is then there's the magic and the
[0:32:27] SPEAKER_01: mundane. Like then you can see where you're special. Of course, you're special. Actually,
[0:32:32] Unknown: we're all special. It's like the funniest joke ever. That you were pulled away from it. You're
[0:32:38] SPEAKER_00: like, Oh, right. Duh. Like just because I'm here and eating a raspberry, like whatever, you know?
[0:32:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Brooke is brooking. And that is so special. And Vanessa is venetian. And that is like,
[0:32:51] SPEAKER_01: incredibly special. And it's fucking magic. Like, I don't know, you know, with everything
[0:32:56] SPEAKER_01: that's going on in the world today, the fact that people can still keep showing such genuine
[0:33:01] Unknown: love to one another and opening up and like doing things like that's magic, magic. I feel it in my
[0:33:09] SPEAKER_01: body. I don't just describe it as magic as a concept. It's like, I still the other day, I was,
[0:33:15] SPEAKER_01: I was at this place in Austin, it was outside of the city. It's like, it's a kind of like sacred
[0:33:24] SPEAKER_01: land that's run by the Indigenous Women's Network. We're in the middle of nowhere and it's winter,
[0:33:28] Unknown: it's December and there's this peach blossom tree fucking blossoming. It's December. It's not
[0:33:36] Unknown: supposed to be. We're like looking at it like, okay, what is going on? This little special guy
[0:33:42] SPEAKER_01: just doing its thing, you know, that's magic. It's blossoming in December. It's like this weird,
[0:33:47] SPEAKER_01: magical thing that you can see. So the joke in this whole exploration of humanity and where we
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_01: start to go when we're looking at personal growth and spiritual evolution is we keep trying to get
[0:34:00] SPEAKER_01: somewhere. We already are. And if we can just stop trying to get somewhere, if we could stop holding
[0:34:07] SPEAKER_01: out hope that later I will finally be extra special when X, Y or Z or later I will finally
[0:34:14] Unknown: be extraordinary where X, Y and Z, the whole structure collapses like the way Chuggy and
[0:34:20] SPEAKER_01: Trunk would be like, lose hope. You have to lose hope. And oh my God, some of you hated that.
[0:34:25] Unknown: You hate when we talk about losing hope. It's really good news. It's such a relief.
[0:34:30] Unknown: Try it.
[0:34:32] SPEAKER_01: But the whole point was if you could lose hope and the idea that you'd be
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_01: extraordinary and extra special and like better than and like wonderful and all these things,
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_01: the whole structure, the whole mechanism, the whole survival instinct and pain body that's
[0:34:52] SPEAKER_01: driving you to not see the ways you already are would collapse. And then right there and then
[0:35:01] SPEAKER_01: reality would come forward and you would see magic in the mundane. And guess what?
[0:35:06] SPEAKER_01: There's nothing more mundane than human beings.
[0:35:09] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, right. I know. Like all of this stuff. And I think you said it in one of our more recent
[0:35:14] Unknown: episodes that we recorded, like it's really just pointing at how to let yourself be what you
[0:35:20] SPEAKER_00: actually are. It's really simple. Seems like a long complicated journey and people infuse it with
[0:35:27] SPEAKER_00: all kinds of ideas about how they're going to attain superpowers or, you know, be the important
[0:35:31] SPEAKER_00: enlightened one or whatever. But it's really basic, really ordinary. And what you discover there is
[0:35:41] Unknown: extraordinary. You know, that's the paradox when you really can land there. It's really quite
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_00: extraordinary. I think that one of the things that's been helpful for me
[0:35:54] SPEAKER_00: is to figure out what my tell is about when the hungry ghosts are taking over.
[0:35:59] SPEAKER_00: And I think that we all have some that are universal and we all have some that are unique to us.
[0:36:03] SPEAKER_00: So I'll start with what's unique to me. And they're hungry ghosts are so consuming, like our pain
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_00: body triggers that it's actually hard for me to know if mine is more universal. Maybe you can
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_00: reflect whether or not you think it is. I mean, you know what mine is. It's striving.
[0:36:17] SPEAKER_00: So I know that the pain bodies are in charge when I start to obsess about something that I want and
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_00: don't have and strive towards having that thing. And it can take place in all kinds of categories.
[0:36:31] SPEAKER_00: So right now it's taking place in buying a house category. I rent a tiny house. I'm ready to upgrade
[0:36:40] SPEAKER_00: and I'm doing all the things. So how do I scrape together the down payment? And I'm talking to the
[0:36:45] SPEAKER_00: mortgage guy and the real estate agent. I'm looking, I'm like, well, that property is cheap,
[0:36:49] Unknown: but it needs a new septic system. And I'm obsessing and I'm striving and I'm grabbing at something
[0:36:57] SPEAKER_00: down the road. So interesting, right? Then I can go, okay, I'm doing something is in the driver's
[0:37:03] Unknown: seat that is a pain body because I'm grasping, I'm grabbing towards something. And then once I can,
[0:37:12] Unknown: cause I'm hip to my tells, you know, I can slow down a little and go, okay, why, you know, what
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_00: is it I imagine that I will have over there in the future when I've grabbed the brass ring I've
[0:37:25] SPEAKER_00: decided I need to grab. And then it gets really interesting because in this case, what we're just
[0:37:29] SPEAKER_00: talking about is a home. Like I currently have a home. So we're talking about a different home.
[0:37:33] SPEAKER_00: So what's special about the different home? Okay, well, if I can own a home, it means that
[0:37:39] SPEAKER_00: I'm the kind of person who can pull that off. And I have all kinds of stories about how I'm
[0:37:43] SPEAKER_00: a fuck up with money and how I can never get together. And like, I'm a single mom. And what
[0:37:47] SPEAKER_00: if I get myself in a financial trouble and take on too much. And so there's all kinds of fear
[0:37:52] SPEAKER_00: and lack and unworthiness baked in. Well, great. Like, so now that's all been exposed, which
[0:37:59] SPEAKER_00: sometimes means it really vanishes right away. Like you're saying the structure behind it collapses.
[0:38:05] SPEAKER_00: And sometimes it just means that you have this affectionate attention on something. And like in
[0:38:12] SPEAKER_00: the case right now, this is still, it's still ongoing. It's still alive. There's still this
[0:38:16] SPEAKER_00: liveliness about wanting to grab at a different kind of home situation that has all this kind of
[0:38:23] SPEAKER_00: storyline about proving to myself that I'm the one who can fill in all of the many blanks.
[0:38:35] Unknown: But I'm also onto myself. So it can happen with, it just softens things so much. And it doesn't
[0:38:43] SPEAKER_00: snowball. It doesn't turn into this freight train that cannot be stopped because as soon as I can
[0:38:50] SPEAKER_00: just affectionately be like, Oh, hey, like, I know this feeling in myself when everything gets like
[0:38:58] Unknown: tight and high strung and like up and forward and graspy and grabby, and I'm trying to shape shift
[0:39:05] SPEAKER_00: and I can't stop thinking about it. Like, I think it's really interesting to pay attention
[0:39:09] SPEAKER_00: to whatever it is we can't stop obsessing on because it is a pain body in charge 100% of the time
[0:39:18] Unknown: because it's not contentment. It's not just resting in whatever is here.
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, it's crazy. You could even make yourself special by claiming to be the most
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_01: fucked up one. Oh, well, I have done my fair share of my dear. I have been especially traumatized.
[0:39:35] SPEAKER_01: Very special because of my, my trauma. And I noticed mine come up the most like, let's say,
[0:39:43] SPEAKER_01: Kieran's a wonderful person where I get to play with this. And because it's like, I want my
[0:39:48] SPEAKER_01: teacher to think I'm extra special. Am I a special student? Am I doing especially well? Like,
[0:39:55] SPEAKER_01: am I not special? You don't seem to be thinking I'm doing especially well. Like, what is the
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_01: implication of that? And so I think mine maybe these days before it used to come up a lot in
[0:40:05] Unknown: career and these days, I think it comes up a lot in relationship, like wherever, wherever I can.
[0:40:13] Unknown: And, and then maybe just in particular that one, because maybe it's like an old desire to have my
[0:40:18] SPEAKER_01: parents think I'm special. I don't really need my parents now to think I'm special. I'm not
[0:40:23] SPEAKER_01: like, maybe that's a safe place to have that expressed. So we can have these funny bits and
[0:40:37] Unknown: I think we can't emphasize enough how delightful it is to enjoy our humanity. Like,
[0:40:45] SPEAKER_01: be lighthearted about the fact that we all want to be special and we all want to be extraordinary
[0:40:52] SPEAKER_01: and like leave our mark. And like, that's so sweet. And it's super precious. And it's lovely.
[0:40:57] Unknown: Of course, we want to contribute to this world, right? We want to do something. We want this
[0:41:04] SPEAKER_01: go around to matter, especially because a lot of people listening to this show,
[0:41:09] SPEAKER_01: we recognize how fucking crazy it is to be human. I mean, it's super hard. Sometimes there's,
[0:41:15] SPEAKER_01: there's chaos, there's strife. And so, hey, if we're going to go through all of this, we want to
[0:41:21] SPEAKER_01: do something worthy of this lifetime. And we want it to make an imprint. I just think sometimes
[0:41:28] SPEAKER_01: we're confused about what it means to do something worthwhile. Like you mentioned, when we were
[0:41:34] Unknown: talking earlier, Brooke, something about like, what if my life is just to be the one who grows
[0:41:40] SPEAKER_01: tomatoes and gets my kid into school, right? Well, besides the fact that that's not perceived as
[0:41:46] SPEAKER_01: extra special by the culture, like putting that completely aside, one might wonder,
[0:41:53] SPEAKER_01: is that contributory enough? You know, am I doing something of relevance? Am I contributing to my
[0:41:59] Unknown: world in a way that matters and makes an impact? And I think that's maybe another line of exploration
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_01: is like, what does it mean to contribute in this world? Sort of what we were talking about a little
[0:42:12] Unknown: bit when we talked about responsibility, but we have this sense that in order to give back
[0:42:19] SPEAKER_01: and be grateful and help our fellow beings on this planet, that it must be something big.
[0:42:26] Unknown: Like I had a client the other day, I had a few clients this week, very upset about politics.
[0:42:33] SPEAKER_01: I would say at least 10% of my clients, you know, really upset about politics. And one of them was
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_01: exploring like her deep sadness that was consistently arising and like pain and
[0:42:46] SPEAKER_01: grief. And people are kind of like, oh, you're being over the top, just don't watch the news,
[0:42:50] SPEAKER_01: you know, can you just back off and give yourself a break? And that certainly did not feel right to
[0:42:57] SPEAKER_01: her, nor would it feel right for me to advise that to her. But we kept sitting and sitting with what
[0:43:02] SPEAKER_01: her heart knows and sitting with like the deeper layers. And when she got back was like, it's okay
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_01: to admit you need help that you don't have to be in this alone, that you can't do everything
[0:43:14] Unknown: and fix everything. You're part of this wonderful process, right? And even that, like this idea that
[0:43:24] SPEAKER_01: we could have that we have to handle it by ourselves, like we alone are capable of this,
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_01: that's a kind of a specialness. It's not at all what she was describing. She wasn't moving towards
[0:43:34] SPEAKER_01: trying to be special on any level. But I think we can all relate in ourselves to this movement
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_01: where it's like, even the way we judge ourselves, like you shouldn't, like you should know how to
[0:43:45] SPEAKER_01: love already, even though you've never witnessed healthy love in your entire life. It's like a way
[0:43:50] SPEAKER_01: that we think we have to be special, because humans don't know how to love if they've never
[0:43:54] SPEAKER_01: been exposed to love at all. Right? Like they have a learning curve that they go through all of these
[0:44:01] Unknown: different things. And so I think we can start to look at, you know, what does it mean to even
[0:44:09] Unknown: contribute? Like what would that look like to be a good citizen of this earth?
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_00: And we can be so, we can place such a giant burden on our shoulders with that, you know,
[0:44:22] Unknown: which we did touch on some in the responsibility episode, but really, so if we can really rest in
[0:44:32] SPEAKER_00: ordinariness, what we're describing is a basic human desire that I think we all have on some level
[0:44:39] Unknown: to experience contentedness. That's why we're always racing towards some imaginary finish line,
[0:44:45] SPEAKER_00: because we imagine that on the other side of that finish line, we'll have an experience
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_00: of contentedness, you know, but we can have it here. So if we're talking about how we contribute
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_00: to the world, if we had more people who could actually experience in any given moment,
[0:45:04] Unknown: what it feels like to be content. And I don't mean complacent. Those are very different words.
[0:45:13] SPEAKER_00: I mean, rest in themselves with contentedness and at the same time, be a very participatory
[0:45:18] Unknown: member of the world. We would see really different solutions to our problems. I think we would see
[0:45:25] SPEAKER_00: very different communities, different parenting, different love relationships, different kinds of
[0:45:30] Unknown: intimacy that are born of contentment, as opposed to what's wrong, what's bad, what you need to
[0:45:40] SPEAKER_00: place 100% on your shoulders and that you're not a part of some larger collective that you on your
[0:45:45] SPEAKER_00: own need to fix all the problems that you need to do it in a big way and a special way. And you need
[0:45:51] SPEAKER_00: to devote your whole life to it. It's so fatiguing, like there's such a relief in coming home to
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: ordinariness and contentment. And from there, we just have completely different kinds of solutions
[0:46:03] SPEAKER_00: and contributions to the world than the ones we make from strife. And we have to be contented.
[0:46:10] Unknown: We have to hold that as at least a possibility or else we're just going to be creating more
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_00: banging together pots and pans in the collective, which I think we can all agree we don't want more of.
[0:46:25] Unknown: Gosh, this may sound overly simplistic, but I was just thinking as you were talking about
[0:46:32] SPEAKER_01: the power of conversations and how some of this dilemma is that people are not having deep
[0:46:38] Unknown: conversations as much as they may need to. Because of course, when I heard my client do that,
[0:46:47] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, of course, it's so common that you would feel that it's all falling on you. And it's so
[0:46:54] SPEAKER_01: common that you would be worried and concerned. And these things are so ordinary, they're so human.
[0:47:01] SPEAKER_01: But if you don't have a lot of deep conversations with people, sometimes you don't recognize. So,
[0:47:07] SPEAKER_01: for example, if you're thinking to yourself, why can't I learn this faster? Why can't I do more?
[0:47:12] SPEAKER_01: Why can't I? There's this way that you don't realize as you're putting yourself above the
[0:47:18] Unknown: average person in your own expectations, right? We expect so much extraordinaryness from ourselves.
[0:47:28] SPEAKER_01: And sometimes it's obvious and sometimes it's not because we just don't know what's happening
[0:47:32] SPEAKER_01: for other people, right? Like, we should all be able to be in a healthy love relationship and we
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_01: should all feel confident and we should all be able to be happy and grateful every day. We should
[0:47:43] SPEAKER_01: already know ourselves. We shouldn't be in confusion or in mystery. We should definitely be healed of
[0:47:49] SPEAKER_01: all past traumas, right? And we should be able to work a full-time job, be a parent and still
[0:47:56] SPEAKER_01: manage to single-handedly take down a political system that we don't think is working.
[0:48:03] Unknown: I know. We do this to ourselves.
[0:48:06] SPEAKER_01: We do it to ourselves. And in the moments that we're doing it, we don't see
[0:48:11] SPEAKER_01: how our expectations are all baked on us being superhuman, like extraordinary beyond words,
[0:48:19] SPEAKER_01: because we don't recognize it. If we were to talk, like sometimes the privilege that I think you
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_01: and I have and having worked with people for so long is I'm like, oh, of course you feel that way.
[0:48:30] SPEAKER_01: That's so common. It's so normal. It's so human of you. I mean, 10 people this week told me the same
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_01: same kind of thing, you know, that they're grappling with, you know, we don't see it.
[0:48:42] Unknown: So we don't see that what we've been setting ourselves up for is extraordinary expectations,
[0:48:49] SPEAKER_01: you know, superhuman expectations. So there's so much relief we can get
[0:48:56] SPEAKER_01: in recognizing our own humanity, which might be another way of saying ordinary. I mean,
[0:49:03] Unknown: the funny thing is it's like we all bleed red. We all want love. We all are afraid.
[0:49:11] SPEAKER_01: We all feel sometimes like we're not good enough, whether we're conscious of it or not.
[0:49:16] SPEAKER_01: You know, we all might feel afraid to die. That's not for everybody, but it's so common.
[0:49:22] SPEAKER_01: You know, like these are some of the basic things and they're very ordinary.
[0:49:26] Unknown: You know, our humanity is very, very ordinary. And so I think what I mean, we've kind of said it, but
[0:49:35] SPEAKER_01: I guess the message we keep trying to drive home to ourselves and to all of you listening is that
[0:49:41] Unknown: as soon as you relax into what if ordinary is just where I need to be, like even just play with that,
[0:49:49] Unknown: what would that mean if I wasn't trying to be other than I am, other than my humanity,
[0:49:57] SPEAKER_01: then this magical relief comes, this ease comes, more contentment comes.
[0:50:02] SPEAKER_01: And then when that happens, you finally rest and you're more present. And then
[0:50:07] Unknown: you begin to see the magic of being alive and being in this human body and in this world of form.
[0:50:14] Unknown: So gosh, we're right at New Year's, you know, like this is right around the holiday season.
[0:50:23] SPEAKER_01: We're rapidly coming up to New Year when everyone's going to set these big sexy intentions for
[0:50:29] SPEAKER_01: themselves. And what would it be like just to try on for size if our goal was just to be more human
[0:50:37] SPEAKER_00: and be more ordinary? And I think that you've pointed out a really beautiful way to even just
[0:50:42] SPEAKER_00: play an experiment with that in your day to day life. And whoever are the people who you're
[0:50:48] Unknown: surrounded with friends, family, children, partners, whoever, can you give yourself permission
[0:50:58] SPEAKER_00: to have more conversations with them where you're your totally ordinary human self, your complex
[0:51:06] SPEAKER_00: multi dimensional self, and really say what's true for you, not in a flinging flinging way,
[0:51:14] Unknown: but to feel like you have permission to be a human being who's vulnerable, and tired,
[0:51:21] SPEAKER_00: and confused, and whatever you are, you know, because those kinds of really intimate
[0:51:27] Unknown: conversations are our great gateway to changing our own ecosystems, you know, then we start to
[0:51:34] SPEAKER_00: have much more juicy relational systems. And that in and of itself relieves a huge
[0:51:40] SPEAKER_00: burden and invites a lot of, I think, really good unfolding.

[0:52:52] SPEAKER_00: lovely one from Jenisok on iTunes. She writes, I often sigh, laugh, gasp out loud, and even weep
[0:53:00] SPEAKER_00: in recognition of myself in your intimate discussions of the meaning and sometimes mess
[0:53:06] Unknown: of figuring out how to be yourself in the world. Thank you for your candor, vulnerability, and
[0:53:11] SPEAKER_00: assurances. You have brought me relief and given me a place alongside you and within myself as few
[0:53:17] Unknown: things ever have. Thank you so much. It means so much that we're doing some good in the world as we
[0:53:24] SPEAKER_00: talk these things out on the show.
