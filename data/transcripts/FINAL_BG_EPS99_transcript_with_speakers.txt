[0:00:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and my co-host, Brooke Thomas.
[0:00:40] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're having conversations about the awakening spiritual path.
[0:00:45] SPEAKER_00: And what does that even mean?
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_00: What is a real evolution of our lives?
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: How do we ultimately embrace everything?
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_00: The beauty and the crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human
[0:01:00] Unknown: life.
[0:01:01] SPEAKER_00: In today's conversation, we're deep diving into the pattern of codependency.
[0:01:08] SPEAKER_00: Brooke and I have both been codependent in our lives and have slowly but surely been
[0:01:13] SPEAKER_00: working our way through to greater freedom.
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_00: So in this episode, we're looking at what does it actually mean to be codependent because
[0:01:21] SPEAKER_00: the way we're using the term is a little bit different than classical psychology.
[0:01:27] SPEAKER_00: How does codependency affect us or show up in our lives?
[0:01:31] SPEAKER_00: And of course, ultimately, how can we begin to shift this pattern that can be so exhausting,
[0:01:38] Unknown: frustrating and limiting to many of us?

[0:02:24] SPEAKER_00: So if you're in mixed non-swearing company, you may want to wear some headphones.
[0:02:29] Unknown: Okay, everyone, here we go.
[0:02:34] SPEAKER_00: Hello, Brooke.
[0:02:35] SPEAKER_00: Hey, Vanessa.
[0:02:37] SPEAKER_00: Well, it's been probably several weeks now that we've been talking about conditioning,
[0:02:45] SPEAKER_01: right?
[0:02:46] SPEAKER_00: And what if we're all conditioning and then we just heard from Neelam talking about presence
[0:02:51] SPEAKER_00: and how the patterns of the past can be running through their grooves.
[0:02:56] Unknown: And so today we're going to talk about one kind of conditioned pattern or one way we
[0:03:05] Unknown: can engage habitually, which is co-dependency.
[0:03:11] SPEAKER_00: I wish I had like a soundtrack button I could push with like an audience like, yay!
[0:03:16] SPEAKER_00: Yay, co-dependency episode!
[0:03:20] SPEAKER_00: Co-dependency and we were looking back, right, to see if we had ever spoken about this in
[0:03:24] Unknown: any kind of clear way.
[0:03:27] SPEAKER_00: And we couldn't see any evidence of us having done an episode really devoted to this, even
[0:03:33] SPEAKER_00: though we know we've mentioned it from time to time.
[0:03:38] SPEAKER_00: So we thought it was just due time.
[0:03:40] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, a whole episode where we can dig in and not, you know, circle it in relationship
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_00: to other things too.
[0:03:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and in part because of what you were saying earlier, Brooke, when we were offline,
[0:03:53] SPEAKER_00: which was that we get a lot of emails about this.
[0:03:56] SPEAKER_00: They may not use the word, but people talk about boundary issues or what am I responsible
[0:04:03] SPEAKER_00: for when they're navigating relationship with others.
[0:04:07] SPEAKER_00: And these are very common questions for humans because humans and relationships go back all
[0:04:14] Unknown: the way.
[0:04:16] SPEAKER_00: And we often grapple with them, but they're extremely common questions for people who
[0:04:20] Unknown: are empathic.
[0:04:22] SPEAKER_00: So maybe we can begin at the top with starting to frame out what we mean when we talk about
[0:04:31] Unknown: co-dependency.
[0:04:34] Unknown: Because earlier when I was in grad school for psychology, I just hated this term.
[0:04:41] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, it's hard to know why you hate things because it's possible I hated it because
[0:04:46] Unknown: I was co-dependent without wanting to acknowledge it at the moment.
[0:04:52] SPEAKER_00: But when I look back, why I think I was having such an aversion to the word was dependency.
[0:05:00] Unknown: And my, I guess my thought that if I was co-dependent, it meant I was dependent on someone, which
[0:05:10] Unknown: I took, I guess in a very material way, like I'm needy and I'm taking things from someone
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_00: and didn't feel like a reflection of the kind of self-reliant, independent personality structure
[0:05:26] Unknown: I was cultivating at the time.
[0:05:28] SPEAKER_00: You know, in fact, I felt fairly self-reliant, fairly resistant to needing things from people
[0:05:38] SPEAKER_00: or being a burden on people.
[0:05:40] SPEAKER_00: And then here you have this term like co-dependency that in my mind implied I was dependent on
[0:05:47] SPEAKER_00: you and you were dependent on me.
[0:05:49] SPEAKER_00: And I really took umbrage to it.
[0:05:52] SPEAKER_00: Like I didn't like it at all.
[0:05:54] SPEAKER_00: And I think also in the field of psychology, I'm sure you've come across this, Brooke,
[0:06:00] SPEAKER_00: but when you talk about co-dependency, you mostly hear it in addiction circles, addiction
[0:06:05] SPEAKER_00: recovery circles, when they're pointing to the pattern of one person enabling an addictive
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_00: loop and then the person in addiction feeding somehow the other person who is enabling.
[0:06:19] SPEAKER_00: Are you like, that's probably where you hear it most commonly, don't you think?
[0:06:23] SPEAKER_00: I think so. Yeah.
[0:06:24] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And that didn't feel like a fit for me.
[0:06:28] Unknown: So I'm not sure when I started to recognize I was co-dependent, but I know it really came
[0:06:36] SPEAKER_00: home for me when I was listening to the way Matt Kahn framed it up.
[0:06:43] SPEAKER_00: So maybe we can get into our understanding of what co-dependency means so that, you know,
[0:06:52] SPEAKER_00: as we're continuing to unpack it, we have like a baseline understanding that we're all agreeing
[0:06:57] SPEAKER_00: upon in this conversation.
[0:06:59] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And that, you know, for those who are new to the show or for those who aren't even
[0:07:03] SPEAKER_00: new to the show, that our interest is always less like, especially when we come up with a word that
[0:07:09] SPEAKER_00: in psychology circles is like a very, it's a textbook word. You will literally find it
[0:07:15] SPEAKER_00: in textbooks and it will give you quite a lot of information if you read it.
[0:07:19] SPEAKER_00: So our interest is never in being like, let's define a word in the way that it's supposed to
[0:07:24] SPEAKER_00: be defined in a certain field of study. We really want to get at this from our own experiences of
[0:07:30] SPEAKER_00: it. And God knows we both have a lot of, you know, deep lived experience inside and emerging out of
[0:07:38] SPEAKER_00: co-dependency. So if those of you listening are psychologists or therapists or are in recovery
[0:07:44] SPEAKER_00: circles and you're like, that's not the way I've heard that talked about before. That's possible.
[0:07:47] SPEAKER_00: Like, so we're trying to reshape the word or make the word less fraught by talking about how we
[0:07:54] SPEAKER_00: actually experience it.
[0:07:55] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's a really good, that's a really good thing to lay out. We've been having some
[0:08:01] SPEAKER_00: exchanges with some of our listeners in written form on Patreon or on Facebook. And I'm always
[0:08:07] SPEAKER_00: like, I've never been the best with language, not with articulation. I'm very good with articulation,
[0:08:13] SPEAKER_00: but with being very precise, because to me it's always like, does it carry the energy?
[0:08:19] SPEAKER_00: Right? Like, does it carry the seed, so to speak? And so I'd like that you're bringing that in.
[0:08:25] SPEAKER_00: This may not be very precise, but I think when you hear us speak about co-dependency from
[0:08:31] SPEAKER_00: this lens, from this vantage point, you all will get why we're using this word that might be defined
[0:08:39] SPEAKER_00: in a slightly different way in other circles.
[0:08:42] SPEAKER_00: So I think that we can start off, I'll just kind of kick around some thoughts on what I take it to
[0:08:48] SPEAKER_00: be and we'll go back and forth and see if we can flesh it out. But let me see, I think I wrote this
[0:08:54] SPEAKER_00: down in a way that was really helpful on my Instagram and maybe I'll just refer to it.
[0:09:01] Unknown: Okay, let's see. I said, put simply to me, co-dependency means that, quote, I can't feel
[0:09:09] SPEAKER_00: happy when others around me aren't. It means, quote, I can't be exactly who I am if I think
[0:09:16] Unknown: it will hurt or bother someone. It means I feel responsible for others' wellbeing.
[0:09:24] SPEAKER_00: It often also means worry, anxiety, frustration, exhaustion, and self-doubt.
[0:09:31] Unknown: So part of why I wrote that was, you know, this has been the story of my life and it's not uncommon
[0:09:39] SPEAKER_00: for empaths and it's not uncommon for people who were raised in collectivistic cultures where the
[0:09:46] Unknown: family comes first, right, the family before the individual, where sort of baked into the idea of
[0:09:53] Unknown: relationship is, you don't threaten the family system with your individual experience.
[0:10:04] Unknown: So when I get really close to this concept or the context that we're laying out right now of
[0:10:11] Unknown: co-dependency, it's almost like who I show up to be in a certain moment is not the person
[0:10:20] Unknown: I show up to be in a certain moment depends. It depends on where you're at. If you're not happy,
[0:10:29] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to be happy and upset you. You know, if you're sad, maybe I'll adjust my vibration and
[0:10:34] SPEAKER_00: be sad with you so you don't feel alone and I can mirror you in that. I don't want to ruffle
[0:10:40] SPEAKER_00: your feathers. I don't want to have needs that you can't tolerate, right? I don't want to
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_00: threaten anyone, upset anyone, hurt anyone, lose anyone. So it's this
[0:10:54] Unknown: how I show up, how I allow myself to show up has a dependency in some regard on who I'm around
[0:11:04] SPEAKER_00: and what their needs are and what they're going through. So maybe we could just start riffing off
[0:11:09] Unknown: of that a little bit. Yeah, and excuse my cough. You're describing perfectly what I discovered in
[0:11:17] SPEAKER_00: myself many years ago is that I had lived my whole life in this very energetic and emotional
[0:11:23] SPEAKER_00: contortionism, which is like if you've been conditioned to be co-dependent, which many of
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_00: us have, so it's not a rare thing. We're talking about a very normal part of the human condition
[0:11:35] SPEAKER_00: in our culture, that there's this way that you automatically contort yourself and your own
[0:11:45] SPEAKER_00: experience for the others around you and there is this mechanism of control embedded in that on both
[0:11:52] Unknown: sides. So inside the self, it's I can save them, fix them, deliver happiness to them, deliver
[0:12:05] SPEAKER_00: an aha to them, deliver awareness to them, if I. So we're controlling ourselves. So in the case of
[0:12:14] SPEAKER_00: somebody's in a very, very angry mood and you're in a very joyful mood and you enter the room and
[0:12:23] SPEAKER_00: you feel a wall of angry, now I'm not saying you're going to be completely oblivious and just skip
[0:12:28] Unknown: around the dining room table and be like, I don't know what you're in a twist about because
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_00: relationality always requires that we meet the moment in some way. But instead of it being like
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_00: a third thing, which is the relationship of these two different dissonant things meeting, what
[0:12:45] SPEAKER_00: happens when these two things meet, it's, oh, they are experiencing anger. So I need to control myself
[0:12:53] SPEAKER_00: in some way. I need to make myself small. I need to contract my body. I need to
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_00: let them vent. I need to dim my joy. I need to judge myself for feeling joy. Like these are
[0:13:06] SPEAKER_00: all alternatives. And then inside of the self, the other place that control comes up is in the other
[0:13:13] SPEAKER_00: person because usually codependency is a relational thing where both sides unconsciously and in
[0:13:20] SPEAKER_00: innocence, this is their conditioning on both sides. So the other person is like, yes, they need to
[0:13:26] Unknown: deliver a certain thing to me in order for my existence to be real. So they need to validate
[0:13:37] SPEAKER_00: what I'm feeling. The reason why this comes up in recovery circles, just to give an example, is
[0:13:41] SPEAKER_00: like, let's say somebody is an addict and they have a strong victim pattern. The reason why I
[0:13:49] SPEAKER_00: use or the reason why I drink is because my life has been horrible. I have been incredibly
[0:13:56] SPEAKER_00: victimized. I will never be able to recover from this, like all those kind of common addict
[0:14:04] SPEAKER_00: feelings. And I'm in recovery for the record, so I'm not saying this from on high. And so it's like
[0:14:12] SPEAKER_00: they need to pull from the other person to deliver that that belief they have about themselves is
[0:14:18] SPEAKER_00: true. So the way that might happen in the other person is they'll get a lot of they'll desire or
[0:14:24] SPEAKER_00: require a lot of poor you. This is where the enabler stuff comes in. Yes, it is so hard for
[0:14:31] SPEAKER_00: you. I know you're trying so hard. I know you're the one who's had the hardest luck ever. And so
[0:14:37] SPEAKER_00: it becomes this circular symbiotic thing where it's like this echo chamber that the two people
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_00: are in or that the small group is in, in the case of a family where it's like, I need you to deliver
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_00: this. Yes, and now I am delivering this. And it's like nobody gets to be autonomous or having any
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_00: true experience, right? Like there would never in that circumstance I just painted out be the
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_00: person saying like, the thing that would break a codependent contract would be like,
[0:15:09] Unknown: I just think you need to figure this out. I can't help you anymore. Right? Like contract broken,
[0:15:14] SPEAKER_00: because they're no longer feeding the like, yes, how can I help you? How can I take care of you?
[0:15:20] SPEAKER_00: How can I fix you? How can I change my way of being to feed what you believe is actually
[0:15:27] SPEAKER_00: happening here? So what holds the contract in place is this contortionism feedback loop
[0:15:34] SPEAKER_00: that's happening on both sides. This is running below the law of consciousness. So we're talking
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_00: about humanity thing, which I want to say so that we're not like, who's doing it wrong,
[0:15:48] SPEAKER_00: right? Like who's making the big mistake of going to banish to the face? Exactly. Who gets banished
[0:15:54] Unknown: to the basement? We're saying like, most of us have touched this pattern, whether it be in
[0:16:07] SPEAKER_00: very frequent and intimate ways, or like here and there. So
[0:16:13] Unknown: well, that's really interesting. I never really think about it in terms of control, though I
[0:16:19] SPEAKER_00: understand it as you're saying it, it's just like a different twist of words that I never really
[0:16:24] Unknown: chewed on. And also, what's really funny is, I understand when the wounds of codependency were
[0:16:32] SPEAKER_00: formed earlier in my life, there was an active participant who seemed to be requiring that of me,
[0:16:39] SPEAKER_00: right? Like my family, bless them, but it seemed to be that they were requiring me to show up in a
[0:16:46] SPEAKER_00: certain way in order for them to feel okay or stabilized, right? But what's interesting is that
[0:16:52] Unknown: as we go about life, if this like field of codependency keeps running in us, if those
[0:17:00] Unknown: belief systems of I have to like, what shows up in me is dependent on what is needed by the
[0:17:10] Unknown: atmosphere or by the environment, if that keeps running, we can do it without that person requiring
[0:17:16] Unknown: it at all. And also requiring is interesting, right? It doesn't mean they'll be comfortable
[0:17:23] SPEAKER_00: with it. But here's why I'm saying it. I remember when Matt Kahn first spoke about vibrational
[0:17:28] Unknown: codependency, and I think it was in his first book, Whatever Arises Love That, that I first came
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_00: across him talking about vibrational codependency. And I thought this was a really interesting
[0:17:39] SPEAKER_00: differentiation because it's like feeling the energy, the vibration of the person you're
[0:17:46] Unknown: relating with, and just matching it completely unconsciously. Like all of this is unconscious
[0:17:54] SPEAKER_00: that we're talking about, but this is like unconscious unconscious until it's conscious.
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_00: Automatic lightning fast.
[0:18:01] SPEAKER_00: Oh, we could imagine that possibly people who have become prone to this throughout their life,
[0:18:09] Unknown: however that began, have like, very sensitive mirror neurons, like we could imagine.
[0:18:15] SPEAKER_00: That's interesting. Yeah.
[0:18:17] SPEAKER_00: Right. That it's something like almost like a vigilance for emotion and vibes could develop
[0:18:22] SPEAKER_00: for whatever reason, either we're born with it, or it's something that gets shaped by trauma in our
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_00: lives, whatever the case may be, and that we just immediately match the resonance.
[0:18:34] SPEAKER_00: Now, you could see why somebody's survival system would think to do that. Because
[0:18:43] Unknown: think about the way we talk even culturally. Misery loves company. Right? Now think about the way
[0:18:51] Unknown: certain groups of people bond. They bond over complaining, right? Or if they're sad and you're
[0:18:59] SPEAKER_00: happy, it can feel like an offense to their system. There's a lot of envy in the human
[0:19:05] SPEAKER_00: survival system. Right? So it's like you can't push someone's button of envy. I used to watch
[0:19:12] SPEAKER_00: people early on my whole life. I've always just been an observer of myself and others and the
[0:19:17] Unknown: human condition. And let's say somebody wasn't in a relationship, and then one of their friends
[0:19:23] Unknown: got in one, and it would be like ouchy for them to hear about it. Right? Now that's just true.
[0:19:31] SPEAKER_00: It just was ouchy for them to hear about it, because something very real was arriving for them.
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_00: But if the person who just got into a new relationship was empathic enough to sense that,
[0:19:44] Unknown: what would they do? Well, perhaps they wouldn't talk about it ever. Or perhaps they would only
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_00: talk about the problems they had in their new relationship. Right? Or perhaps, you know,
[0:19:57] SPEAKER_00: and you can keep filling in the blanks, right? It can go in all sorts of directions. But
[0:20:03] Unknown: vibrational codependency is very interesting to look at because it's pre-verbal. It's pre-all
[0:20:09] SPEAKER_00: of this. It's like mommy's upset, vibrate like mommy. Right? Daddy's upset, vibrate like daddy.
[0:20:16] Unknown: You know, like it is just a basic empathy, a basic mirroring. But you can see how over time
[0:20:26] SPEAKER_00: we can start to turn that into a survival structure. Like, okay, if mommy's sad,
[0:20:32] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to vibrate like that, and then I'm going to try to uplift her, and then I'm going to do all
[0:20:36] SPEAKER_00: these things, and we're going to just stay in the field of resonance of the people who we love
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_00: because we think that's what it means to be loving because we can feel their subconscious scripts
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_00: asking for us to be that way, as you were pointing out, Brooke, earlier. And so we think,
[0:20:55] Unknown: okay, we'll fill that in. And then also, you know, in innocence, we feel like, well,
[0:21:00] SPEAKER_00: if we were to fill the role they're looking for, they could be happy. And if they could be happy,
[0:21:04] Unknown: they'll stop vibrating in that really kind of like staccato anxiety vibration, for example,
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_00: and then I will finally get to be at peace and I will finally relate to them because they don't
[0:21:16] SPEAKER_00: know how to find a sense of peace and stability within my own nervous system, as long as somebody
[0:21:22] Unknown: else is in, let's say an excitation or depression. Yeah, this is like crucial stuff because
[0:21:29] SPEAKER_00: if it's about, so it's very normal, and I would say healthy, to desire the ability to feel safe
[0:21:38] Unknown: and open and contented in your environment. And so if the pre-conscious movement is, if I mirror
[0:21:51] SPEAKER_00: if I mirror them, or, you know, then this uncomfortable feeling will go away. Like if
[0:21:59] SPEAKER_00: I deliver to them, like, you're so sad. Yes, I see that you're so sad. How can I help? How can I serve
[0:22:05] SPEAKER_00: you in your sadness? Then the sadness will go away. Life is sad. Yes, it is sad. You know, there's this
[0:22:14] SPEAKER_00: idea that that will break the uncomfortable sensation as you're pointing to. But if we
[0:22:21] SPEAKER_00: understand instead that it is the hungry ghost pattern, you know, it's the bottomless hole,
[0:22:27] SPEAKER_00: because it's based on, to bring up another one of my favorite things, object consciousness, right?
[0:22:34] SPEAKER_00: Like if we're in object consciousness, where we unconsciously believe that we're a certain kind
[0:22:41] SPEAKER_00: of object and other people believe there are certain kinds of objects. So like, in the case of the,
[0:22:46] SPEAKER_00: you know, sad, nothing ever goes my way, I'm a victim object, they believe that they are that,
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_00: that their life is that. And that that is true in that moment, like with the reality that we all
[0:22:59] SPEAKER_00: we all fluctuate and have different days and moments. But in this moment that we're giving as
[0:23:03] SPEAKER_00: an example. And so if what they need, if what their ego needs is please feed me the food that says,
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_00: I am this object. Then we go, okay, here's the food, here's your sad cake, you know, like,
[0:23:21] SPEAKER_00: which the food in this case is that we are matching their vibration.
[0:23:27] SPEAKER_00: All we're doing is feeding the hungry ghosts. Hungry ghosts never get full. Hungry ghosts just
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_00: consume. And so the pattern never gets broken, it just gets more ingrained, which is like really
[0:23:42] SPEAKER_00: helpful to know. And I know this was extremely helpful for me. You know, I grew up in a family
[0:23:47] SPEAKER_00: of origin, my parents are delightful human beings who've been sober 25 years, but they got sober
[0:23:51] SPEAKER_00: when I was 16. So and I was the oldest and took care of my brother a lot. So this was like a lot
[0:23:56] SPEAKER_00: of the pattern in the household, which then just became my way of being I was a very codependent
[0:24:01] SPEAKER_00: person. So not surprisingly, I was also prone to I had lots of very normal relationships with healthy
[0:24:09] SPEAKER_00: people. Fortunately, my ex husband was one of those. But then I also had a couple of abusive
[0:24:13] SPEAKER_00: relationships because abusive relationships require a codependent pattern. And there was a
[0:24:20] Unknown: moment in my adult life where I could finally see this hungry ghost pattern, like it doesn't matter.
[0:24:28] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter how much I feed this pattern, the exact food that it's asking of me,
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_00: I can feed it this food all day long, I can shovel it in. And when I say food, again,
[0:24:40] SPEAKER_00: what I mean is match the vibration and like agree with it and say, Yes, it is this way. How can I
[0:24:46] SPEAKER_00: help and like contort myself? Like, how can I, how can I support and help this? It will never
[0:24:55] SPEAKER_00: be full. Like when you really have that land in your being experientially, like,
[0:25:02] SPEAKER_00: this will never stop pulling for this food, this pattern. That's when codependency can
[0:25:10] Unknown: break. Because then it's like, Oh, well, the alternative is to just not believe that it's true,
[0:25:18] Unknown: that I need to keep delivering this kind of belief system back to them in this echo chamber of like,
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_00: how do I take care? How do I match your vibration? How do I behave, feel, act, believe in ways that
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_00: don't threaten your way of seeing the world and what you want to receive back from me.
[0:25:38] SPEAKER_00: And so I'm passing that on because that was like really, really helpful to see the futility
[0:25:44] SPEAKER_00: of this thing that I was doing in innocence, totally just out of conditioning. And what I have
[0:25:50] Unknown: been told was normal as a way to behave. And even if they were to feel better for some
[0:25:55] SPEAKER_00: period of time, it's not necessarily for their highest, like nothing's really healing for them.
[0:26:01] SPEAKER_00: They're not experiencing any more freedom from this and nor are you. Let's get really subtle
[0:26:07] Unknown: if we can, because obviously, we all know that empathy is a beautiful thing. And that sometimes
[0:26:14] Unknown: if someone's sad, I am sad with them. Yeah. Right. And that we hold space for their beautiful hearts.
[0:26:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. And we hold space for them. Like when someone grieves, I grieve with them sometimes.
[0:26:28] SPEAKER_00: Right. So we can understand that there's a beauty and a goodness and a rightness
[0:26:36] SPEAKER_00: to empathy. So then exactly what are we talking about? We can even start to get to other emotions.
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_00: It's like, well, if someone's afraid, does it help if I'm afraid with them?
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_00: I don't know so much. No, actually, that's one emotion. I don't know if it actually helps.
[0:26:52] SPEAKER_00: But if someone's angry, I may get angry with them. Right. Like, so we can see how that helps. So then
[0:26:59] SPEAKER_00: what are we talking about? So what comes to my mind is Judith Blackstone. And I hope I don't
[0:27:05] SPEAKER_00: confuse this more, but this is subtle shit and y'all are subtle listeners. And so let's just go there.
[0:27:13] SPEAKER_00: Okay. When we learned Judith Blackstone's work, which is called The Realization Process,
[0:27:19] Unknown: and we will be interviewing her again in a month, but you all can go back and there's an earlier
[0:27:26] Unknown: interview Brooke did with her on the liberated body that we shared. But when we were working
[0:27:32] Unknown: with Judith Blackstone, who is very gifted at helping you experience yourself as the subtle
[0:27:41] Unknown: field of fundamental consciousness, you can call it awake awareness. It's subtler than energy,
[0:27:49] Unknown: but you can relate with it on a similar level. She would talk about how oftentimes to feel
[0:27:59] Unknown: people's feelings, it's like as if you left your own body, right? Like, I almost like disavow
[0:28:05] SPEAKER_00: my feelings to go into your field of experience, that it could almost be like that, at least with
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_00: some patterns. That was the one that was happening, I think, with me the most.
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_00: And she would teach how we can stay in our body. In fact, we could be so deeply in ourselves
[0:28:25] SPEAKER_00: that when we get so deeply within ourselves, we make such contact with ourselves
[0:28:32] Unknown: that we can feel both ourselves and the other person at the exact same moment, without ever
[0:28:41] Unknown: leaving the heart, the depths, and the beingness of ourselves and our bodies.
[0:28:51] SPEAKER_00: Now, why am I bringing this up? Because when I learned to do that, because it was a practice,
[0:28:57] SPEAKER_00: I had kind of been the person who gets really diffuse. If I could put an image to what I think
[0:29:03] SPEAKER_00: I was doing, it was like leaving my body to feel all of the energy and the environment so I can
[0:29:09] SPEAKER_00: be vigilant to it, responsive to it, and then I'd like come back home to see what I was going to do
[0:29:15] Unknown: about all of that, if I could put a terrible image to it. But when I learned to be in myself and feel
[0:29:23] Unknown: other people, what happened was everything was more fluid. Like, I might feel sadness for you,
[0:29:32] SPEAKER_00: but it was very clear, clearly like sadness for you, not my sadness, not Vanessa is sad, not
[0:29:41] SPEAKER_00: an identity, not a long lingering thing, but rather, oh, I feel sadness as I sit in this case,
[0:29:49] Unknown: let's just say with Brooke, sadness comes through me. But I have enough space to understand that
[0:29:55] SPEAKER_00: even though we're one, this is your experience and I am relating with your experience.
[0:30:00] Unknown: Let me give you the counter just to make it simpler. This is what I used to do with my beloved
[0:30:06] SPEAKER_00: ex-husband. Sorry, dear. But this poor man who is very lovely would get upset about something normal,
[0:30:12] SPEAKER_00: like work stress. He would have work stress, he'd come home, he'd be, you know, twisted up about it,
[0:30:19] Unknown: bad mood, sad, angry, grief-stricken, whatever he was. Innocently, I would exactly match his vibration.
[0:30:27] Unknown: So, if he was scared, I was scared. Okay, first, if any of you have ever felt scared
[0:30:35] SPEAKER_00: or really sad before, you might notice that it's not actually so helpful when someone
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_00: matches your vibration exactly. In fact, it's like now we have two of us lost in the experience of
[0:30:47] SPEAKER_00: fear and sadness, which can almost imply if they have any thoughtfulness in their being that they
[0:30:53] Unknown: now need to take care of you. Hello, my mom. Hello, most of our moms for those of us who are in our
[0:30:59] SPEAKER_00: generation anyway. That was like the way you got to be female. All right, my mom got more anxious
[0:31:05] SPEAKER_00: than me and then I was like taking care of her over things that were my anxiety pattern. Okay,
[0:31:09] Unknown: so not only was that not super helpful to him, but it was almost like I would be in such a state of
[0:31:15] SPEAKER_00: disorganization that even upon leaving him, now I would turn it into my anxiety, my fear.
[0:31:22] SPEAKER_00: And then I would start to wonder where I got this from and I would start to tell stories about why
[0:31:26] Unknown: I'm anxious and why I'm scared. And the whole thing would become personalized and it would become
[0:31:33] SPEAKER_00: something that Vanessa was struggling with. There was no distance, no space. And then I would go
[0:31:39] Unknown: down a rabbit hole of all of the conditioning and trauma I was exposed to, right? Whether it was
[0:31:46] Unknown: because I made it about something that happened in my life in the past or like you start to feel like
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_00: why do I always have to take care of people, right? Which is hello, my old conditioning,
[0:31:59] Unknown: not reality, right? So I know that that might have added some confusion, but maybe Brooke,
[0:32:06] SPEAKER_00: you can help fill in some blanks. I'm trying to differentiate between being a really sweet,
[0:32:11] SPEAKER_00: empathetic person and being caught in a pattern of codependency.
[0:32:17] SPEAKER_00: Vanessa Cark-Kelman I think it doesn't add more confusion. I'm so glad you brought it in because
[0:32:21] Unknown: I think it's like a super important clarification. And had my talking gone unchecked by what you just
[0:32:30] SPEAKER_00: brought in, it would be easy to believe that like the remedy, because right, like we're always going
[0:32:35] Unknown: inside ourselves, be like, okay, well, how do I stop it? Okay. So the remedy must be that we're
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_00: all just like, I see you're suffering. Good luck, asshole. That's your problem. That does feel shitty,
[0:32:52] SPEAKER_00: but I feel great, you know, like, which is not what I'm describing at all. And actually what's
[0:32:59] SPEAKER_00: fascinating about this and the subtlety and the nuance of this is that what heals this pattern
[0:33:04] SPEAKER_00: is the genuine ability to be with another, which is what you're describing.
[0:33:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, like in the realization process, what you, you know, walked us through that you were able to
[0:33:18] SPEAKER_00: learn and what that whole process is for is like, how do we be with really be in ourselves? I mean,
[0:33:26] Unknown: the actual sensation of being in ourselves and in the world at the same time. So if we live in a
[0:33:35] Unknown: world of duality, usually to be with another in a dualistic world means I need to abandon myself,
[0:33:41] SPEAKER_00: I need to go over there, you know, or to be with myself to take care of myself. It needs, it means
[0:33:47] SPEAKER_00: I need to abandon the other. So we're talking about this vast, juicy, nuanced middle place
[0:33:55] SPEAKER_00: where we're learning how to genuinely be with the self and others at the same time. And when we can
[0:34:03] SPEAKER_00: do that, codependency can't take hold. You know, it's like having a Velcro where both sides are the
[0:34:11] SPEAKER_00: soft fuzzy side, like they're not gonna stick, there's nothing to hook in, it's just relating.
[0:34:19] SPEAKER_00: And there will be some people who their conditioning is so dense that whatever for
[0:34:26] SPEAKER_00: whatever reason in their path, they can't not be abusive, or they can't not be lost in their
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_00: addictive pattern or their victim martyr story or whatever. Or they can't not just simply be
[0:34:41] SPEAKER_00: triggered every fucking time we come around. And in that case, like, yes, sometimes bonds need to
[0:34:48] SPEAKER_00: break, relationships need to end. But we're not turning our back on the world and every relationship
[0:34:54] SPEAKER_00: or any hard emotion. We're learning how to actually genuinely be with others. And you described
[0:35:01] SPEAKER_00: so eloquently your pattern, you know, so these, we have lots of different patterns. Yours was the
[0:35:06] SPEAKER_00: like leave and go over there and like come back. Mine feels, has always felt a little bit more like,
[0:35:15] SPEAKER_00: um, like I remember when we were in realization process, a lot of in the training, a lot of what
[0:35:20] SPEAKER_00: you were playing with was like, discovering that you had skin, like energetically their skin,
[0:35:26] SPEAKER_00: it's a boundary, but it's a porous boundary, but you have it, right? For me, the pattern has always
[0:35:32] SPEAKER_00: been more that I'm, I'm like the Tin Man. I was joking about this with you recently, like oil can,
[0:35:40] SPEAKER_00: like I get so rigid and so defended, and then I'll robotically act out what people need. So
[0:35:47] SPEAKER_00: it's still an abandoning of the self because I'm like a total fortress against the outside world.
[0:35:56] SPEAKER_00: So I'm, I'm on the inside going, this is crazy, but you know, and I'm, I'm acting out whatever
[0:36:01] SPEAKER_00: the role is that's being required of me in this codependent example. So it was a process of
[0:36:07] Unknown: learning how to actually feel safe enough to soften, and then I can be receptive and to not
[0:36:14] SPEAKER_00: feel threatened. If for example, my son has a really terrible day at school, the response isn't
[0:36:22] Unknown: to wall off. The response is also not to become the midwife who's saying,
[0:36:30] SPEAKER_00: it does hurt, you know, being overly lost in empathy. It's like an actual sensation of
[0:36:39] SPEAKER_00: what it feels like is an opening and a broadening out into the space at the exact same time that I
[0:36:46] SPEAKER_00: am totally deep in the center of myself. And then what happens in our interaction, let's say if it's
[0:36:52] SPEAKER_00: my son after a tough day of school is he first of all really feels that I'm there,
[0:36:59] SPEAKER_00: which most of us don't have a ton of experience of being in a room with someone
[0:37:05] SPEAKER_00: who's really with you, not in you in an aggressive way, and not walled off and not
[0:37:11] SPEAKER_00: thinking about what they're going to do 30 minutes from now. So it's like I really land.
[0:37:16] SPEAKER_00: So just that, talk about mirror neurons, he can soften. And then whatever he's feeling
[0:37:24] SPEAKER_00: isn't being told it needs to go away or change, and it's also not being fed. Like in the hungry
[0:37:29] SPEAKER_00: ghost example, like yes, you do have a hard situation. It is so hard, right? It's literally
[0:37:36] SPEAKER_00: just like you were saying, fluid, it moves. Oh, this is here now. Doesn't mean anything about
[0:37:43] SPEAKER_00: you and identity and object doesn't mean anything about the future. We don't know the future.
[0:37:50] SPEAKER_00: This might arise frequently, this might arise never again. Who knows, but like right now we're
[0:37:55] SPEAKER_00: here together. And that's genuine being with which describing it over a podcast is
[0:38:04] SPEAKER_00: flimsy, but hopefully points out that this journey of being able to be with the self
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_00: and with another is something we don't see modeled a ton in our culture.
[0:38:18] SPEAKER_00: And like a super worthy journey, because it leads us to genuine hereness in the sense that we get
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_00: to enjoy our own lives, but also genuine relationality, where we have these very loving
[0:38:31] SPEAKER_00: and nourishing relationships where whatever arises in the moment is fine to be there,
[0:38:39] SPEAKER_00: no problem. And that is what real love is. That's non object based love. You know, you deliver to me
[0:38:48] SPEAKER_00: that I am the greatest thing or ever or you deliver to me that I am the biggest fuck up ever.
[0:38:54] SPEAKER_00: Just depends on what the ego structure wants to believe about itself. Genuine relationality is like
[0:39:00] Unknown: the whole spectrum of a life is welcomed, that we have up moments and down moments and discover new
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_00: things and all of that can just move through. Right, that we see different things and we need
[0:39:16] SPEAKER_00: different things and we can each feel different things, you know, that can all exist. I mean, for me,
[0:39:23] Unknown: if we talk about what happens with codependency for the person who's exploring it, right, the
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_00: person who may be in it, whether the other party knows or not, but if we look at what are the signs
[0:39:37] Unknown: of it, it is for me, it was anyway, exhaustion. So feeling really exhausted by people. Well, of course,
[0:39:45] SPEAKER_00: I feel exhausted by people if I am tossed about depending on their mood. Well, you can bet that
[0:39:51] Unknown: I started to get really fussy about who I would spend time with and when, right? Well, if I can't
[0:39:59] Unknown: exist in my own mood and space and needs, if someone else is in an alternate need, mood, space,
[0:40:08] SPEAKER_00: well, you can bet I need a lot of time alone and then I can call myself an introvert, which I'm not
[0:40:13] SPEAKER_00: sure if I am or not. Still think that's an interesting question.
[0:40:15] SPEAKER_00: Totally not. But yeah.
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_00: Well, you know, I still think I require quite a lot of time alone. I can work from home alone
[0:40:27] SPEAKER_00: and that's not very common for extroverts. But I still don't even know if any of that is totally
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_00: makes sense or if the spectrum is broader and we just have people issues, but regardless,
[0:40:38] Unknown: right? That's next episode.
[0:40:39] SPEAKER_00: That's just an ongoing point of interest for me. But you get exhausted by people. You feel obligated
[0:40:48] SPEAKER_00: a lot. You feel responsible. You feel like you have to fix something, but you don't know how.
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_00: You feel like you have to help people. But it's not this beautiful, oh, I want to be of service,
[0:40:59] Unknown: man. Like it's not this calm thing. It's like when I was stuck in codependency, I was codependent
[0:41:05] SPEAKER_00: with my clients, I suppose is a fair way to say it. Certainly codependent with life. It was like
[0:41:11] SPEAKER_00: I was obligated to help people. That's what good people do. That's what I had to do to earn the
[0:41:18] Unknown: right to exist here. And then showing up with people in the space of my profession was exhausting.
[0:41:26] SPEAKER_00: Exhausted me. I was obligated. And then your mind races like, how can I fix them? How could I help
[0:41:31] SPEAKER_00: them? How can I find that one salient important point? Did I do enough for them today? Right? And
[0:41:39] SPEAKER_00: we do this all of the time. It just takes a little bit of self-reflection. And my clients are saying
[0:41:45] SPEAKER_00: it. I know you're all thinking it. Brooke and I, you and I do it. It just takes a little self-reflection
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_00: before you see that you constantly feel like you have to help somebody fix themselves,
[0:41:56] Unknown: solve their problem, get out of pain. Well, one, how beautiful. You're very nice people.
[0:42:03] SPEAKER_00: I'm a very nice person. So are you. We really, truly hate to see others suffer. It's really,
[0:42:10] SPEAKER_00: really achy to watch other people suffer. So that's just the most basic part of it.
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_00: Two is what we talked about earlier. Oh, well, I really would rather you not suffer around me
[0:42:22] SPEAKER_00: because then I suffer with you. So, you know, how could I help? Right? How do we make this feeling
[0:42:27] Unknown: go away? And then three, some of it is, you know, this, I guess I'll call it a misunderstanding
[0:42:37] SPEAKER_00: that can be cultivated culturally that suffering is a problem. And that pain is a problem. And that
[0:42:43] Unknown: what we ought to do is help people out of it. So, you know, you feel recently, I've seen this with
[0:42:51] Unknown: several people, people who are friends, my partner, going through things, you know, like,
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_00: well, one, there's just so much happening in the collective. But two, if you were to believe the
[0:43:05] SPEAKER_00: mystical side of the equation, many of the mystics of today are pointing to this kind of quickening
[0:43:11] SPEAKER_00: in the culture, like this quickening of consciousness, this quickening of awakening,
[0:43:15] Unknown: and that along with that comes healing, right? Or at least this kind of uprising of all of the
[0:43:24] SPEAKER_00: conditioning you thought you could suppress with your defense mechanism. Yeah, it's thawing,
[0:43:29] SPEAKER_00: which means it's on the move. It's on the move. And here we're coming for an iceberg. And, you
[0:43:35] SPEAKER_00: know, so you're watching people you care about, I'm watching people I care about go through pain.
[0:43:41] Unknown: Now, the old voice of codependency says, my job is to get them out of pain.
[0:43:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And if they're in pain, I must be doing something wrong, because I'm not enough to make
[0:43:52] Unknown: them happy or whatever. Gosh, right. I forgot that one. That one is very deep. And thank God,
[0:43:58] SPEAKER_00: I forgot that one. Yes, that says something. But exactly. Right. So then you go about your business
[0:44:04] SPEAKER_00: trying to get them out of pain. Now, not only is that often futile, it's certainly futile for any
[0:44:11] SPEAKER_00: extended period of time, it can work for for bits and moments, which is fine. You know, it's always
[0:44:15] SPEAKER_00: nice to cheer someone up when that's the appropriate medicine. But depending on what they're going
[0:44:21] SPEAKER_00: through, it can be disrespectful to their process, right, they may need to be in it. And we're
[0:44:27] SPEAKER_00: signaling to them, that's not okay. We can be disempowering them by signaling to them that
[0:44:32] SPEAKER_00: we're going to fix it, or we're going to solve it. Or like you were just pointing to Brooke,
[0:44:37] Unknown: we could be making it about ourselves, like, but what's the matter with me that I'm not enough that
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_00: you're in pain, right? We could do all sorts of these things without consciously recognizing what
[0:44:48] Unknown: we're doing. Because we have this idea that pain is bad. Because we can't separate from it to allow
[0:44:56] SPEAKER_00: someone the space like to be with them, but not of them, so that they can go through it without it
[0:45:03] SPEAKER_00: taking us into the tidal wave. Right? So it's almost like the process of recovering of healing
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_00: of the wounds of codependency is a breaking up some of these misunderstandings, like you were
[0:45:15] SPEAKER_00: saying, Brooke, like, it's just hungry ghosts, kids, like, it's not feeding anything genuine half the
[0:45:21] Unknown: time. Or B, you know, pain's not the worst problem. Sometimes we need to go through
[0:45:28] SPEAKER_00: achy times in order to come to the other side in a new future. Or C, we weren't put on this planet
[0:45:36] SPEAKER_00: just to give everything to the pain and suffering of others, we also exist. Right? And there's God's
[0:45:43] SPEAKER_00: seed within us. And God's seed wants to manifest in the way it wants to manifest, whatever that
[0:45:48] Unknown: spontaneous unfolding is, right? So there, one is we could start to look at all of these
[0:45:51] SPEAKER_00: misunderstandings so that we can open up different perspectives and vantage points.
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_00: But the other for me, I guess there's two others, and I'll lay them out, we could talk about them.
[0:46:02] Unknown: One was learning to find existence within my body. Yours was a little different, Brooke, but either
[0:46:09] SPEAKER_00: way, it's being open and receptive without leaving yourself without abandoning yourself.
[0:46:15] Unknown: Um, and then the other was like, figuring out, well, what will I do? Right? Like, if I'm not
[0:46:22] Unknown: going to try to fix you, solve your problem, match you, right, resonate at the same level of
[0:46:30] SPEAKER_00: frequency, what do I do? Which I think is important to talk about a little bit as well.
[0:46:35] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And I think that if, you know, so many of us, maybe all of us, all of us have been so
[0:46:40] SPEAKER_00: deeply conditioned in object culture, that we and everything are objects, that it can be very hard
[0:46:48] SPEAKER_00: to know the what then, right? Because if I'm an object, then I need to be a certain kind of object
[0:46:57] SPEAKER_00: or delivering something to the other objects out there so they approve of my object nature, right?
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_00: So if that goes away, there is the like, well, what then? And I think, you know, the answer is
[0:47:10] SPEAKER_00: whatever is truly arising for you in that moment. And that's where it gets trickier, because most of
[0:47:16] SPEAKER_00: us don't have a ton of experience, although those listening here, this is our whole journey is, is
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_00: turning towards this experience. But like, what's genuinely here, right? Because we can be with
[0:47:27] Unknown: somebody who's in a lot of pain. And something in us can say, like, this is not mine, and I don't
[0:47:34] Unknown: want to be here. And I don't need to be here. Just the same, we can be with someone in pain.
[0:47:38] SPEAKER_00: And we can say, I just want to sit right down with this person and be I want to be here.
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_00: I don't want to go anywhere. This is exactly where I want to be. And I just want to be like,
[0:47:49] SPEAKER_00: holding their head in my lap and just letting them cry and just being wide open with them.
[0:47:55] SPEAKER_00: We don't know, like we don't know what's going to come up in a moment. That's why, you know,
[0:47:59] Unknown: life is alive. It's it can't be predicted. And so it's basically permission, deep permission to
[0:48:08] SPEAKER_00: ourselves to exist. And this is always what we're coming back to. But if we have deep permission to
[0:48:14] SPEAKER_00: exist, it means we're living beings that are having experiences. And so we're going to pay
[0:48:21] Unknown: attention in that moment. You know, hopefully not just surfing the surface waves of conditioning
[0:48:29] SPEAKER_00: where it's like, you know, somebody's in pain, and, and my conditioning says, blame them,
[0:48:37] SPEAKER_00: you know, or get or get mad at them or storm off, right? We all have conditioning about how we react
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_00: to large emotions arising in other people. But instead, like, what's genuinely here?
[0:48:48] SPEAKER_00: What really feels like the right thing that's coming up? And this is why it's so tricky is
[0:48:53] SPEAKER_00: because it just escapes the whole, you know, two step blueprint to perfect relating and perfect
[0:49:01] SPEAKER_00: happiness formula. It's not a formula. It's an inner journey, and it's an outer relational journey.
[0:49:09] Unknown: Perhaps Nila's sharings last week can can help refine this a little bit, because as she was
[0:49:18] SPEAKER_00: saying, if you if you can't be present, you can't have discernment. Right. So that's the rub,
[0:49:27] Unknown: right? That's the rub for us. It's like, sure, if we can't seem to tolerate being present, and this
[0:49:34] SPEAKER_00: can be especially true if you have some of this codependency patterning running where
[0:49:38] SPEAKER_00: when someone hurts, you hurt. So it's like hard to be really present. But regardless,
[0:49:44] SPEAKER_00: if we can't be present, we can't discern and then the conditioning kind of runs it.
[0:49:49] SPEAKER_00: So then what I found in my past is it's like, almost what you and I were trying to sketch out,
[0:49:55] SPEAKER_00: like, okay, so it's not my job to fix anyone's problems. So then I'll do nothing about it.
[0:50:00] SPEAKER_00: Right. This is duality. It's always going to ping to the opposite end of the spectrum.
[0:50:05] SPEAKER_00: All the same conditioning, the very same conditioning being pulled through the same
[0:50:10] SPEAKER_00: circuit, right? Yeah. And so, you know, this is just these are some beautiful subtle
[0:50:18] Unknown: pointers towards more freedom towards greater freedom, so that we can show up and exist.
[0:50:26] Unknown: So that we can show up and exist. And for now, I think I've gotten actually tremendously better.
[0:50:35] Unknown: I mean, it was actually really nice to watch my husband have, you know, some pain and feelings
[0:50:42] SPEAKER_00: arise and to in retrospect, see, I didn't do any of the things I did in the past. Amazing, right?
[0:50:51] Unknown: And that was just available. It wasn't, I didn't try to do things differently. It was just what
[0:50:57] SPEAKER_00: was up, right? So we all can get greater and greater levels of freedom around this.
[0:51:04] SPEAKER_00: But in the meantime, the thing I remind myself of, because if you're a practitioner, this comes up
[0:51:09] SPEAKER_00: in practice. Am I helping my clients enough? Am I being good enough? Am I saying the right thing,
[0:51:13] SPEAKER_00: doing the right thing? You know, if you're in a love affair, it comes up there. If not, if you
[0:51:17] Unknown: have a family, that it might be showing up in that domain, right? So I heard Matt Khan say something
[0:51:28] SPEAKER_00: recently, and I can't remember what talk, I'm sorry. I think it was something about breaking
[0:51:33] SPEAKER_00: free of victimhood. If I can find it, I'll share it, but I don't really remember which one it was.
[0:51:37] Unknown: But he was saying something to the effect of that the only real thing we can do is just let
[0:51:44] Unknown: someone know they're not alone. And I was like, yeah, blammo. Like, that's the ticket, man. I mean,
[0:51:52] SPEAKER_00: I wish I could do people's journeys for them. Sometimes, you know, I wish I could do my journey
[0:51:58] SPEAKER_00: better sometimes. But I wish I could do people's journeys for them. But we can't. And I don't
[0:52:06] SPEAKER_00: understand it all. I don't have all the mystical answers. And I don't know what we're here for. I
[0:52:11] Unknown: really don't. And I don't know why people suffer. I really don't. I have ideas, but I don't know. But
[0:52:17] Unknown: what I do know is that we can't fix it for them. I know that we can't really take on their journey.
[0:52:24] SPEAKER_00: I know that's never worked. I know that feeding people's circular conditioning loops, the hungry
[0:52:30] SPEAKER_00: ghosts that you were talking about, Brooke, I know that doesn't help. That that's never really helped,
[0:52:36] SPEAKER_00: maybe for a short time to earn trust to build a rapport, but it's not a solution. So then it's
[0:52:42] Unknown: like, well, what has ever helped? Well, why is this show helpful? Right? Yeah, we throw out a bunch of
[0:52:48] SPEAKER_00: nice ideas, and we share experiences. But why does that help so that we're not alone in this?
[0:52:55] SPEAKER_00: Why do we like it? Because we get to connect with listeners, we're not alone. You all are not alone.
[0:52:59] SPEAKER_00: We're all together. So that to me was a tremendous amount of comfort. And it's like, what can we give
[0:53:05] SPEAKER_00: we can give love, but love in the service of them knowing like, Hey, man, I'm right here. Like, yeah,
[0:53:13] Unknown: human, huh? Mercy, right? Yeah. This this whole journey. And and don't discredit how big that is.
[0:53:22] Unknown: And you don't have to match someone's frequency to let them know they're not alone. I want to give
[0:53:30] Unknown: one last example of this. Personally, you can give as many as you want, Brooke, but this just occurring
[0:53:35] Unknown: to my mind. You and I have mentioned before the book Wired for Joy. So in this book Wired for Joy,
[0:53:43] Unknown: the way that the neuroscientists kind of break down this conversation is that they say we have
[0:53:51] SPEAKER_00: these different brain states and I might be misquoting this slightly, but y'all can look
[0:53:56] SPEAKER_00: up the book and get a better understanding. But there's five of them. The the number one is like
[0:54:02] SPEAKER_00: transcendent. We are all God. It is really the most blissful state. And then number five being
[0:54:09] SPEAKER_00: I am in hell. I'm in despair. I am totally alone. I'm utterly alone and I can't feel anyone.
[0:54:15] SPEAKER_00: I can't actually feel anyone. And if any of you have been in a state like this, or if you've been
[0:54:20] SPEAKER_00: around someone like this, it will feel a little perplexing because people will be there going,
[0:54:25] SPEAKER_00: I love you. And nothing is felt. There's like zero connection, right? And in between there are other
[0:54:31] SPEAKER_00: states. Three being like functional, two being yeah man, pretty good. And four being also a pretty
[0:54:39] SPEAKER_00: low, still despair filled kind of state, but with a little more contact. Okay. Why am I breaking all
[0:54:45] SPEAKER_00: this down? Well, if I was to be sitting with somebody who was in a four or five and I was to
[0:54:54] SPEAKER_00: be humming it a two, it may feel like a real mismatch to them, right? And it might be hard
[0:55:01] Unknown: to find a way to connect with them. But it's certainly not going to help for me to go down
[0:55:07] SPEAKER_00: into a four or five, right? Because then we're both like kind of lost in hell together. And I'm
[0:55:13] Unknown: using that word, you know, a little bit lightly here, but feels like hell sometimes. So we'll be
[0:55:19] SPEAKER_00: lost in it together. So I always feel like when you're with someone, it's almost like
[0:55:25] SPEAKER_00: when we were talking about the fundamental consciousness and the Judith example, it's like,
[0:55:30] SPEAKER_00: can I stay in my body, but also meet you and yours? It's almost like I don't leave the two or one
[0:55:37] SPEAKER_00: state I'm in. And yet at the very same time, I'm walking down the stairs to meet you in four or
[0:55:44] Unknown: five. And then I'm taking your hand and I'm going, I'm here. I get it. I get it. And sometimes we do
[0:55:53] SPEAKER_00: have to mirror, oh, that does hurt, doesn't it? I get it. But even as I'm doing it, I'm starting
[0:55:58] Unknown: to slowly help you walk up a step or two, right? And that love does that, that tenderness that you
[0:56:05] SPEAKER_00: were saying, Brooke Neelam talked about tenderness is transcendence at the end of our episode last
[0:56:11] Unknown: week, that tenderness starts to naturally invite someone to climb a little, right? That not
[0:56:19] Unknown: aloneness and then they can feel you. But it's like, I kind of do sense, like I have to come to
[0:56:24] Unknown: where you are a little bit, but it's not like I'm forgetting where my starting place was. It's not
[0:56:31] Unknown: like I'm abandoning where I really am, but I am going to come and meet you so we can be there
[0:56:36] SPEAKER_00: together and you can feel me. And then we can slowly ascend a little bit as much as someone
[0:56:42] Unknown: can in any given moment based on capacity. Does that make sense? Yeah, it's like we're not
[0:56:50] SPEAKER_00: abandoning our own sovereignty and we're not abandoning other people's sovereignty either.
[0:56:56] SPEAKER_00: You know, we're saying that we're, we can be with them and we have complete faith
[0:57:04] SPEAKER_00: that their life is, is their life and that they have total capacity to live it, whatever that
[0:57:11] Unknown: looks like. We don't know what that's going to be. And that our life is our life, you know,
[0:57:16] SPEAKER_00: that everyone's existence has merit and we can meet each other without having to mirror.
[0:57:22] SPEAKER_00: We can be with without having to sort of play the, the echo chamber feedback loop with one another.
[0:57:28] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, take on the state of. Yeah.
