[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I will be
[0:00:13] SPEAKER_01: joined shortly by my dear friend and co-host, Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking
[0:00:18] SPEAKER_01: about being on the embodied spiritual path. And what does that actually mean? What is
[0:00:24] SPEAKER_01: a real evolution of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and the
[0:00:30] SPEAKER_01: crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life? In today's
[0:00:38] SPEAKER_01: episode, we're responding to a dear Bliss and Grit inquiry on one of our favorite topics,
[0:00:47] SPEAKER_01: boundaries. Talking about boundaries, how do you know what's truly right for you? What
[0:00:53] SPEAKER_01: happens when you say yes and you mean it only to later feel tired and grumpy? Your ability
[0:01:00] SPEAKER_01: to stay true to your inner yes and no is a most basic affirmation of your right to exist
[0:01:07] Unknown: as you are. Yet, so many of us are challenged in this arena. With all our cultural and familial
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_01: conditioning around earning love and being of service, you can imagine this conversation
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_01: is full of our own personal stories and also tools we've collected to share with you along
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_01: the way. If you're enjoying the show, we would be delighted if you left a review on
[0:01:35] SPEAKER_01: iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. You can also head over to Bliss
[0:01:41] SPEAKER_01: and Grit.com to subscribe to hear any updates on upcoming events we might have in the near
[0:01:47] SPEAKER_01: future. One last note, just in case you're new to the show, Brooke and I sometimes have
[0:01:53] SPEAKER_01: potty mouths. So if there are kids around, you may want to pop in some headphones. Okay,
[0:01:59] Unknown: everyone, here we go.
[0:02:03] SPEAKER_01: Hello, dear Brooke.
[0:02:05] SPEAKER_01: Hello, dear Vanessa.
[0:02:07] SPEAKER_01: And hello to all of you. We thought that today we would do a Dear Bliss and Grit episode. I
[0:02:17] SPEAKER_01: guess it's been on our mind because, you know, some of these topics which you all are grasping
[0:02:21] SPEAKER_01: so well and engaging on in such a beautiful and kind of high level way, but they're big, you
[0:02:29] SPEAKER_01: know, and a lot of times we all might feel the need to kind of bite size them into, okay, these
[0:02:33] SPEAKER_01: are great ideas, but now how do I take it into my life, right? How do I take it off the cushion and
[0:02:40] Unknown: into the world? So a few weeks back, we posted a little social media image. And the quote on the
[0:02:48] SPEAKER_01: social media image was this, no might make them angry, but it will make you free. If no one has
[0:02:56] SPEAKER_01: ever told you your freedom is more important than their anger. No might make them angry, but it will
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_01: make you free. And one of our listeners had responded asking the following question, any
[0:03:09] SPEAKER_01: advice for someone who says yes, and that really does feel okay at the time, and it's only later
[0:03:17] Unknown: when I'm exhausted and grumpy that I regret it. I genuinely genuinely would like to be able to do
[0:03:24] Unknown: it all, but don't have the energy. So we thought we would start to just discuss this a little bit
[0:03:31] Unknown: from our lens of experience. So Brooke, you want to kick in your two cents? Sure, I was gonna say
[0:03:38] Unknown: solve this whole situation. I'm just kidding. We love solving problems. So our favorite. So yeah,
[0:03:46] SPEAKER_00: this is this is not an unfamiliar situation for me what the listener describes. Like, I said yes,
[0:03:53] SPEAKER_00: I meant yes. In that moment, I really wanted to help. And then I wound up I can't remember
[0:03:58] SPEAKER_00: exactly what word she said. But like, in my case, I would say, tired, resentful, burned out.
[0:04:04] SPEAKER_01: I think she said something like tired and grumpy.
[0:04:06] Unknown: Yeah, yeah. So that is not unfamiliar for me. And it's, it's pretty unfamiliar these days,
[0:04:14] SPEAKER_00: which makes the I'm an alien from another planet feeling quite large when I don't find myself
[0:04:22] SPEAKER_00: moving to do what would have been my normal pattern. So I guess what I'm getting at is
[0:04:26] Unknown: conditioning, you know, we all have these layers of conditioning, many, many, many layers. And
[0:04:35] Unknown: so it's almost like a, I'm not the first one to use this analogy, but like a program or software
[0:04:42] SPEAKER_00: that you're running in a computer system, right. And if that's the software that you have installed,
[0:04:47] SPEAKER_00: it's going to automatically go along that route, that program route. And so if somebody if you're
[0:04:54] SPEAKER_00: somebody who's operating system is coded this way, if somebody says to you, hey, do you mind,
[0:04:59] SPEAKER_00: you have a truck, do you mind helping me move my couch this weekend? And your operating system
[0:05:04] Unknown: is automatically going to go like, yes, sure. It's the weekend. But usually, there's a lot more to
[0:05:13] Unknown: that story. If we can slow it down. So there's usually a bunch of thoughts that happen all at
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_00: once. And some of them are yes, or the word that pops out of your mouth is yes. And then some of
[0:05:32] SPEAKER_00: the conditioning might be and I'm just giving some examples, I certainly am not trying to speak for
[0:05:37] SPEAKER_00: the person who wrote the question. But in this case, broad brush, some of the things might be,
[0:05:41] SPEAKER_00: it wouldn't be articulated this way, but the conditioning would be I want to be liked,
[0:05:49] SPEAKER_00: helpful people are likable people. I learned that you always say yes, because that's what good
[0:05:58] SPEAKER_00: people do. I'm a helper, like there's an identity of the helper, the one who's always willing to
[0:06:04] SPEAKER_00: put other people first that that's virtuous and that that's valued. And then in that same
[0:06:11] SPEAKER_00: microsecond, whatever other thoughts might have arisen, like, let's say there was some genuine
[0:06:16] SPEAKER_00: no in there, which is like, Oh, my God, this week has been so exhausting. And I really was hoping
[0:06:20] SPEAKER_00: to spend my Saturday staring at a wall drinking tea, you know, or all those things get suppressed.
[0:06:25] Unknown: So I think that when we notice this as a pattern, right, that it's frequent, when I said yes,
[0:06:36] SPEAKER_00: I really felt like yes, I wanted to help. And then I realized I felt exhausted, cranky, burnt out,
[0:06:43] SPEAKER_00: whatever. If we notice that that's a repeating pattern, that gets interesting, you know, then
[0:06:48] SPEAKER_00: it's like, huh, okay, so how can we slow it down so that we can see those bursts of conditioning
[0:06:57] SPEAKER_00: thoughts that happen and just fly under the radar? And, you know, I think about probably because I'm
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_00: wearing them right now, but like noise canceling headphones, you know, you can't hear things when
[0:07:09] SPEAKER_00: you're wearing noise canceling headphones, because they're designed to cancel noise, like
[0:07:12] SPEAKER_00: conditioning is like wearing those headphones, it's designed to shut up the things that don't fit with
[0:07:21] SPEAKER_00: what you were told is right. So if you were told nice people help, always say yes, the noise
[0:07:26] SPEAKER_00: canceling headphones are going to cancel out the sound of your inner self saying anything that
[0:07:32] SPEAKER_00: doesn't match that. Anything that says, Oh, my God, I just want my Saturday to be about laying
[0:07:37] SPEAKER_00: on the floor, you know, just gets suppressed. So the question is, isn't it always how do we take
[0:07:46] Unknown: the headphones off? And how do we hear all those things that we are suppressing and missing?
[0:07:55] Unknown: Yeah, well said. And maybe there's even more we can add to this, because she did go on to say after
[0:08:04] SPEAKER_01: we had responded something to the effect of like, I, you know, I really want to help my community,
[0:08:10] Unknown: like I find that to be a valuable thing. And so one aspect of this is that life is complicated,
[0:08:17] Unknown: and sometimes we are complex, and we do have two dueling needs. So you might have an awareness
[0:08:26] Unknown: that you have a wish to help someone. And that that's a beautiful thing. And you love that about
[0:08:31] SPEAKER_01: life. And that even sometimes when you do it, you feel really great, and they feel great. And that
[0:08:36] SPEAKER_01: whole movement is so cherished. And then you have a wish for more rest and relaxation, because maybe
[0:08:42] SPEAKER_01: you've been working really hard all week, you know, maybe you have other demands on you. And that both
[0:08:48] SPEAKER_01: of these seem like they co arise, they don't, there is an answer as to what's best for you. But both
[0:08:54] SPEAKER_01: wishes may be true, right? I mean, gosh, I never wish I couldn't talk to a friend in need, right?
[0:09:01] SPEAKER_01: It's like, I always wish that that was the case. And sometimes it's not the case that I'm available.
[0:09:07] SPEAKER_01: And there's like a little grief bubble that pops up around it. So, you know, maybe one thing to
[0:09:13] Unknown: recognize about ourselves is like, we get to be complex, like, that's okay to have multiple wishes.
[0:09:21] SPEAKER_01: But when we do have multiple wishes, what is it that we're going to do about it? Which way are we
[0:09:26] SPEAKER_01: going to choose? And what aspect is really driving the bus? Right? So is it the aspect of ourselves,
[0:09:33] SPEAKER_01: like, I always felt that I had to earn the right to breathe by helping people. I mean, it felt
[0:09:41] SPEAKER_01: quite like, I don't get to exist unless I'm in service. That's all that this world could possibly
[0:09:46] SPEAKER_01: be about. So when that kind of energy would grab hold of the wheel and drive the bus,
[0:09:53] SPEAKER_01: it's taking me all over the place. And then I'm giving and I'm overextending, and I'm not aware
[0:09:59] SPEAKER_01: of myself. And, you know, that's a very different experience than when mindful Vanessa feels into
[0:10:06] SPEAKER_01: her body feels what's in alignment and is like, yes, I have this to give right now, I would be
[0:10:10] Unknown: so glad to offer this, right? The movements of the intention are going to look different, and it's
[0:10:17] SPEAKER_01: going to plant a seed that will lead somewhere different, right? So it's like, you know, when
[0:10:21] SPEAKER_01: they talk about karma, and they talk about planting seeds, I think about karma with this talk, I think
[0:10:27] SPEAKER_01: about boundaries with this talk. There's like so much to discuss conditioning, as you said,
[0:10:33] SPEAKER_01: but you know, from karma, they said, if you want to change your karma, you can do these beautifully
[0:10:37] SPEAKER_01: good actions. But we talked about this in the episode on karma, there was like four steps to it.
[0:10:44] SPEAKER_01: So before the action comes the intention. And that is the biggest aspect that plants a seed.
[0:10:52] SPEAKER_01: That's the energy that gets repeated. So if my intention going into this community act of kindness
[0:10:58] SPEAKER_01: is, well, you know, that's what good community people do. And Vanessa wants to be a good community
[0:11:04] SPEAKER_01: person. It's like mom always said, and like all of my conditioning is, is kind of grabbing hold of
[0:11:09] Unknown: that steering wheel. I'm planting seeds of I have to, I'm planting seeds of there is a good and a
[0:11:16] Unknown: bad way to move. And planting seeds of judgment, if I was to actually rest, right? And then I do my
[0:11:24] Unknown: action. And then those seeds start to grow. And that's how they become resentment fruit. And they
[0:11:31] Unknown: become exhaustion fruit. And they become why don't I ever get my needs met fruit, right? So I think
[0:11:38] Unknown: one thing that occurs to me is we have to slow it down, as you said, to start to understand the
[0:11:43] SPEAKER_01: intention of the movement and decide like, if there's not a perfect world where every single
[0:11:49] Unknown: wish I ever have gets met at the same time, which way am I going to move? You know, for you and I,
[0:11:54] SPEAKER_01: we go, well, I guess I'll try to go back to truth. That seems like a right thing to do.
[0:12:00] Unknown: And when there was something else I was going to say that I have a feeling is going to come back
[0:12:07] SPEAKER_01: to me really strongly, but just left. So let's, let's start there. Is that that right? How are
[0:12:13] Unknown: you going to move? Yeah. And I think that feeling into truth, because it has to, because you have to
[0:12:23] SPEAKER_00: swim under the layers of conditioning, you know, and you have to, in order to do that, you have to
[0:12:28] Unknown: have a certain kind of realization about, oh, I have that layer of conditioning. Oh, you know,
[0:12:34] SPEAKER_00: that's a story I've been telling myself about how the world works forever. And those are, you know,
[0:12:41] SPEAKER_00: things that happen to all of us, but they're, they certainly require a certain amount of leaning in
[0:12:45] Unknown: and certain amount of dedication, devotion. So to be able to swim under the layers of conditioning
[0:12:53] Unknown: and to be able to connect with truth. First of all, I guess what I'm trying to say is it's
[0:13:03] SPEAKER_00: going to be challenging. That's okay. It's okay. And so it's all right if you, if you say yes,
[0:13:09] SPEAKER_00: and you meant no. And one of the ways I'm really into time lately, because I'm having a lot of
[0:13:15] SPEAKER_00: insight into the fact that there isn't any, it pops in and out. But we do things in these big
[0:13:23] SPEAKER_00: chunks of time. Like I said, yes. And so that means yes, that means I have to complete this project.
[0:13:31] SPEAKER_00: That means that even the whole time I'm doing the project. So whatever my example was,
[0:13:36] Unknown: using your truck to help someone move their couch on the weekend. I have to ignore myself
[0:13:43] SPEAKER_00: the whole time until I get to the end, when I have placed the couch in their new living room.
[0:13:49] SPEAKER_00: And then I get to feel all the feelings I have, because I made this time chunk arbitrarily in my
[0:13:58] SPEAKER_00: head, which is the project of getting their couch in my truck to their new place. But that's just
[0:14:08] SPEAKER_00: totally arbitrary. So what we want is an opportunity or an ability to connect with ourselves
[0:14:14] SPEAKER_00: in the moments as each moment goes, you know, all this beat, beat, beat, beat every second,
[0:14:21] SPEAKER_00: every microsecond is a different little moment, you know, has this kind of granular grains of
[0:14:26] Unknown: sand quality, really. And so if you can keep checking in with yourself, then you notice the
[0:14:33] SPEAKER_00: resentment, the frustration, the irritation, the exhaustion much more quickly. And then you have
[0:14:40] Unknown: the opportunity to give yourself permission. Because there's always permission to change your
[0:14:47] SPEAKER_00: mind. It's totally human to say yes when you mean no, and to not realize that you meant no, or to
[0:14:54] SPEAKER_00: not realize how much this project you said yes to would take out of you, how much demand it would be,
[0:14:59] Unknown: what it would actually be like, you didn't know until you were in it. You're allowed to go, oh,
[0:15:07] SPEAKER_00: actually, I'm exhausted. I didn't realize I was going to wake up on Saturday morning
[0:15:13] SPEAKER_00: and feel exhausted. I didn't anticipate two weeks ago when I said yes, that I was going to have such
[0:15:19] SPEAKER_00: a demanding work week this week. I didn't anticipate that I was going to be fighting
[0:15:23] SPEAKER_00: off the cold that my son caught at school this Saturday. But I said yes to this giant arbitrary
[0:15:30] SPEAKER_00: time bubble I sealed around the truck couch project. It's like, no, those are moments to
[0:15:37] SPEAKER_00: hear yourself, to hear yourself saying, no, I know you said yes, but it's no this Saturday.
[0:15:43] Unknown: And we get to always, it's okay. I just cringe even listening to this because that's how bad
[0:15:50] Unknown: I am with boundaries still. It's like, I think that boundaries are one of my larger
[0:15:57] Unknown: core karmic issues that I have in my life. And I can see the earlier progression of it.
[0:16:07] SPEAKER_01: Early in my career when I felt like I had to help people because that is the thing to do
[0:16:12] SPEAKER_01: in this world or else life is meaningless and then I am not that good a person and I am selfish
[0:16:18] Unknown: and that whole cascading pain body. So earlier when I had that, it really wasn't different in
[0:16:26] SPEAKER_01: terms of what my day to day looked like. I still worked with people. But the difference was I felt
[0:16:31] SPEAKER_01: obligated. And so I brought that energy in. I made deals financially that may not have felt
[0:16:37] SPEAKER_01: comfortable like bartering things or I spent extra time even if I didn't feel I had that energy
[0:16:43] SPEAKER_01: reserve available or that time reserve available. And then what I noticed in those early phases was
[0:16:50] Unknown: I was completely drained by my practice. I was definitely resentful. The funny thing is like,
[0:16:59] SPEAKER_01: you would say resentful of the people who I was doing too much for but like always what I
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_01: realized was resentful of myself. I mean, it's us, right? It's like, it wasn't them. It was that
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_01: I felt this kind of like umbilical cord between me and them and their need needed to be met by me
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_01: as if they pulled to the left, I was pulling to the left. So of course the resentment seems
[0:17:20] SPEAKER_01: exterior but it's really not at them because all along that was an illusion that they move to the
[0:17:27] SPEAKER_01: left and I have to move to the left. The truth was I have a no. A no exists. Now in my life today,
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_01: it's so much more subtle and it's really refined and it's almost exclusively reserved for my
[0:17:40] Unknown: parents and my husband and you know family members. But nevertheless, I remember reading
[0:17:48] SPEAKER_01: Kieran's book. I forgot the title of it. Do you remember the name of the book?
[0:17:52] SPEAKER_01: Tools for Sanity?
[0:17:53] Unknown: Yeah, Tools for Sanity. Great. And she was telling this story about like what if you were
[0:17:58] SPEAKER_01: bike riding and you're bike riding with your friend and like it's this beautiful day you
[0:18:03] SPEAKER_01: agreed to just like you just said, Brooke. Like I agreed to it. I'm now bike riding and for some
[0:18:08] SPEAKER_01: reason I always picture the Bay Area like I'm bike riding and I'm looking at the Golden Gate
[0:18:13] SPEAKER_01: and I'm along that and then all of a sudden I'm like no, this doesn't feel right anymore.
[0:18:18] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to go home and I don't even need to explain myself you know in Kieran's. I just,
[0:18:23] Unknown: it's not right anymore. I'm going to go home and I'm like what? Right. Like just thinking about it
[0:18:30] SPEAKER_01: is giving me a rash you know and that's because there's something really juicy for me here.
[0:18:36] SPEAKER_01: There's something really core. So I think for many of us the conditioning around these um
[0:18:44] Unknown: umbilical cords to people, the conditioning around taking responsibility for others feelings,
[0:18:51] Unknown: the conditioning around um not wanting to be a selfish thoughtless dick you know like maybe
[0:18:58] SPEAKER_01: our parents were or someone else we knew was and like I do not want to be that person.
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_01: Um the like for me I get afraid like I don't want to be a disappointment to anyone you know so like
[0:19:10] SPEAKER_01: what if I say no I'm done with this movement. I said I'd help you move but
[0:19:17] SPEAKER_01: I don't feel like it anymore. Like wow what if they're really disappointed or their feelings
[0:19:22] SPEAKER_01: are hurt you know the conditioning to not create that experience was so large. So I've had to work
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_01: with it really in micro movements and there's two things that I sort of look at. One is
[0:19:40] SPEAKER_01: well what Kieran, let's say from the spiritual side, what Kieran presents which I think this
[0:19:44] SPEAKER_01: is what I meant to say before and I had forgotten. It's kind of this like large overarching ideology
[0:19:50] SPEAKER_01: that when you don't have can make this a little harder which is what's good for one is good for
[0:19:55] Unknown: all. We are all interconnected. That's a very helpful place to begin because when you're wiring
[0:20:05] SPEAKER_01: around not harming people is so strong and so dense and so deep that's a very soft way to hold
[0:20:13] SPEAKER_01: it and of course a very true way. So I think we can look a little more at that and then the second
[0:20:19] SPEAKER_01: thing that I do is I learn where my boundaries are because I'm exhausted and resentful.
[0:20:25] SPEAKER_01: So I mean this is a very typical thing in psychology. It's like you don't always know
[0:20:30] SPEAKER_01: where your boundaries are until someone's crossed them or until you've crossed them or betrayed them
[0:20:35] Unknown: or let go of them. So you know what's that poem I think we've read it in episodes before but the
[0:20:42] SPEAKER_01: one where like she's you know a person's walking down the street and they fall in the hole and you
[0:20:47] SPEAKER_01: know they get up and then they're walking down the street and like they see the hole but they
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_01: still fall in again and then they get up and then they're walking down the street and finally the
[0:20:54] SPEAKER_01: end of it is they choose another street but in the beginning the best thing we can do is like we're
[0:21:00] SPEAKER_01: seeing the holes. So one bit of advice that I would give that I've given to myself, I've used,
[0:21:06] Unknown: I've given to clients, it's like slow down, recognize when you're feeling exhausted, recognize when
[0:21:12] SPEAKER_01: you're feeling resentful, recognize that means there was a boundary betrayed and then get real
[0:21:18] SPEAKER_01: close to it. Like where was the beginning of that movement? You know what happened in that dynamic?
[0:21:25] SPEAKER_01: Did a belief system like some of the examples you were giving us Brooke, did that get triggered?
[0:21:30] SPEAKER_01: Was a pain body triggered? At what point did the pressure feel so intense that you had to cave on
[0:21:37] SPEAKER_01: what felt more true for you? And as you get real micro about it, these moments are genius and they're
[0:21:43] SPEAKER_01: beautiful because they give you all the information you need to see where you're hooked and where
[0:21:49] SPEAKER_01: you're hooked just points to where you're liberated, right? Well where you can liberate is what I mean.
[0:21:54] SPEAKER_00: Right? I have like 60 things I want to say. They're all jammed in the door trying to get out.
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_00: I know, I know. And they're like me, me, I want to drive the bus.
[0:22:08] SPEAKER_00: This is the important concept to get across. Okay, I'm going to start with slowing down because
[0:22:15] Unknown: we've said that several times. And I would imagine that for some people hearing that,
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_00: it's like, what do you mean slow down? You know, do you mean literally when someone asks you
[0:22:30] SPEAKER_00: for a favor, don't say it, can I get back to you tomorrow? Like that can be helpful.
[0:22:36] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes that is helpful. Yeah, and like a super tangible
[0:22:40] SPEAKER_00: tip and trick kind of way. If it's helpful in the beginning to just give yourself a rule,
[0:22:47] SPEAKER_00: like we've said before, we're not fans of rules. But if it's a rule that just gives you spaciousness
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_00: so that you can actually feel what's true for you, that rule might be something like,
[0:22:58] SPEAKER_00: if this is really a problem for you, right? If you've seen this pattern repeating and it's
[0:23:02] SPEAKER_00: really causing you quite a lot of fatigue and what I would say is harm, you know. To say, I don't
[0:23:10] SPEAKER_00: say yes to favors unless I've had, you know, whatever, two hours or 24 hours to decide,
[0:23:17] SPEAKER_00: can I get back to you tomorrow? That's a really reasonable thing to ask. And that's a very physical,
[0:23:23] SPEAKER_01: tangible world slowdown. And I used to do that without saying that, you know, so just, oh, let
[0:23:29] SPEAKER_01: me, can I get right back to you? Yeah. Like, let me look at my calendar, let me, you know,
[0:23:34] SPEAKER_01: think about it because the whole thing was such a vulnerable exploration. It couldn't even get those
[0:23:38] SPEAKER_01: articulated truth oriented words out. Like this is my policy, but nevertheless, you know, so I did
[0:23:45] SPEAKER_01: have to use that actual physical slowdown so I could get clear because like you were illuminating
[0:23:53] Unknown: that conditioning is so rapidly. Oh, it just zing zings right through the programming. And it's like
[0:24:00] SPEAKER_01: those canceling headphones. I couldn't even feel what my yes was. So I had to do that kind of
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_01: artificial pause. I just couldn't even have articulated it so clearly. Yeah. And we're allowed
[0:24:10] SPEAKER_00: to ask for that. Someone's asking us a favor and asking us if we can help them or asking us anything,
[0:24:16] SPEAKER_00: how we feel about them or what we think we want to do next year for school or I don't know, you
[0:24:22] SPEAKER_00: know, we get to take the space we need. We really do. Yes, we do. And then the other slowdown,
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_00: you know, because we can, because our orientation is thinking in our culture, we can always
[0:24:37] SPEAKER_00: overthink in a way that's not helpful. And I find that with conditioning,
[0:24:41] SPEAKER_00: doing that with a therapist or, you know, a spiritual mentor or coach can be tremendously
[0:24:48] SPEAKER_00: helpful because they can see things they can see patterns that you can't see.
[0:24:52] SPEAKER_00: But thinking to yourself about yourself very quickly gets
[0:24:58] SPEAKER_00: Cirque du Soleil level of acrobatics. So what I prefer for slowing down two things. One, go to
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: the body. And this is a not just when someone asks you a favor, this is cultivate a relationship
[0:25:11] Unknown: with your body in a way where you just feel it on the inside. So for you and I that's somatic
[0:25:20] SPEAKER_00: meditation, you know, for other people, maybe the word meditation gives them hives. At this point,
[0:25:26] Unknown: go to a delicious restorative yoga class. You know, I don't know what it's going to be,
[0:25:32] SPEAKER_00: but like something that gives you and for I know a lot of people who have a very
[0:25:36] Unknown: deep felt experience of their body with sports that they do, you know, swimming or running or
[0:25:45] Unknown: going to yoga. But something that cultivates where you're listening,
[0:25:52] SPEAKER_00: where you're not just feeding input into your body, you know, like you would say,
[0:25:58] SPEAKER_00: in a demanding fitness kind of way, do this, do that. Now it's time for, you know, lat pulldowns
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_00: or whatever. You know, like I mean, more of a receptive listening kind of relationship
[0:26:10] Unknown: and feeling and that way, like that gets stronger and stronger over time. And that way I can feel
[0:26:16] SPEAKER_00: when something's off because that also happens lightning fast. It's just the noise canceling
[0:26:20] SPEAKER_00: headphones didn't let me feel it before. And so if someone asks me for a favor and I suddenly
[0:26:25] Unknown: feel the squirmy wormies in my solar plexus, it doesn't necessarily mean yes or no. It just
[0:26:32] SPEAKER_00: means something. You know, my body, my gut self has some opinion about this and I need a little
[0:26:39] SPEAKER_00: time and space to sink down into that feeling and see is it because when they asked me,
[0:26:46] SPEAKER_00: there was this clash that came together, which was you should say yes. Nice people always say yes,
[0:26:52] SPEAKER_00: clashed with, oh my God, I cannot do another errand this weekend. And so your solar plexus
[0:26:58] SPEAKER_00: went ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. I don't like this clashing. You know, I feel something about
[0:27:04] SPEAKER_00: this. So that's another important slow down. And then, you know, for some people, different inquiry
[0:27:11] SPEAKER_00: tools can work well too. And you and I have talked a good bit about Byron Katie's work on the show
[0:27:17] Unknown: because that puts you in a position where you have to get better at pulling out the thought.
[0:27:25] SPEAKER_00: Like, what was the thought that I had right before I started to feel the upset emotions? Oh,
[0:27:32] Unknown: the thought was, I can't say no. You know, or maybe it was something at them like, oh my God,
[0:27:40] Unknown: they're always fucking asking me for something. You know, you get to pull out the thought and
[0:27:48] SPEAKER_00: then, you know, go through a process of inquiring about is that true? And just getting closer and
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_00: closer to what's actually true for you. So I just want to say that so that people feel like they
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_00: have tools because these things are certainly slippery. Conditioning is slippery.
[0:28:04] Unknown: It's everything. It's everything besides the truth.
[0:28:07] SPEAKER_01: It's everything besides the truth. Exactly. That is exactly right.
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_01: Boom. That just happened. I was thinking too, one of the tools I use actually works with
[0:28:19] SPEAKER_01: the imaginal realm where I've always been prone to picturing things, like getting an image of things
[0:28:27] SPEAKER_01: and then feeling into my body. And then this was further reinforced. It's one way that Kiran will
[0:28:32] Unknown: work with Delicious Yes with people. So image works really, really well for some people. It's
[0:28:39] SPEAKER_01: almost like what Brooke just described. If you're listening well, you'll notice there's these
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_01: different gateways. It's like purely kinesthetic, like come in through mindfulness of the body.
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_01: There's like this other way that you're coming in through mindfulness of the mind, right? Like
[0:28:54] SPEAKER_01: I'm doing inquiry and I'm going to ask questions and prompts. And then there's this other way where
[0:28:59] SPEAKER_01: you can come in with vision or imagination. And all of these will be different gateways.
[0:29:06] SPEAKER_01: And depending on what you're, you know, most able to do, one will be a better gateway for you than
[0:29:13] SPEAKER_01: others or you may use them all, right? So that's up to you. But what I would do is, and I tell this
[0:29:18] SPEAKER_01: to clients sometimes is let's say you're at a crossroads. Let's say there's any question in
[0:29:22] Unknown: your life. Like, do I say yes or no to this job? You know, is this person good for me in my life?
[0:29:28] SPEAKER_01: Is this a healthy person to be around? Do I want to help my neighbor, you know, move? Like Brooke
[0:29:34] Unknown: was using that example. In any of those cases, you can close your eyes, ground your body. I always
[0:29:41] Unknown: start with grounding your body, taking a few breaths, kind of turning on your third eye with
[0:29:47] Unknown: a gentle warmth of attention. And then I picture them. So I picture saying yes to this job and to
[0:29:53] SPEAKER_01: this opportunity. And I picture what that'll be like on a day to day level. And then I picture
[0:29:57] SPEAKER_01: saying, no, oh, I'm sorry. And then I feel into my body. What does it feel like? And what does it feel
[0:30:02] Unknown: like? Because I imagine saying yes. And then I picture saying no. And I go through that and
[0:30:07] SPEAKER_01: I feel into my body. And sometimes you'll get a really, really clear difference. It's just like,
[0:30:13] SPEAKER_01: oh, yeah, I do not want to do this. Or I for sure as shit want to do this. I'm just scared. Or you'll
[0:30:18] SPEAKER_01: get like a really clear answer. And sometimes you'll just get information that'll lead you to the
[0:30:23] Unknown: inquiry phase. But regardless, this is a way to start to learn how to reconnect to your gut
[0:30:32] SPEAKER_01: instincts. Because I think, you know, of course, we must have mentioned this before, but
[0:30:38] SPEAKER_01: conditioning. Did you ever read the Four Agreements, Brooke?
[0:30:43] SPEAKER_00: It's been a long time. But I've had people keep breaking it up with me lately, actually. So it's
[0:30:48] Unknown: time to revisit. Yeah. Oh, God, listen to the audio. Okay. He reads it. And it is delicious.
[0:30:56] Unknown: His voice carries the energy. So it's a great book for those of you who may not have read it.
[0:31:04] SPEAKER_01: But he uses a word that's like, ooh, even more intense than conditioning.
[0:31:10] SPEAKER_00: He uses the word domestication. It's like sucker punch a bullseye. Yes.
[0:31:18] SPEAKER_01: Booyah, boom, crash, all of it, everything but truth there. Like what? And it's so true. And
[0:31:27] SPEAKER_01: it's like, you know, your family domesticates you, civilization domesticates you, our society
[0:31:32] SPEAKER_01: domesticates you. It breaks you in, it trains you in how to be. So the pull to move away from your
[0:31:40] SPEAKER_01: primal instincts via domestication is so strong. I mean, it is the human journey. It's the thing.
[0:31:50] Unknown: It's the number one thing we deal with as humans. It's so strong that we can lose touch with what
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_01: feels right. I mean, oh Lord, I'd like to think I'm advanced on this topic. And I don't mean
[0:32:02] SPEAKER_01: advanced past people. I mean, for myself. And I'm sure I know I am. I know I am. But like,
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_01: every time I think I get like farther, like the new level presents to show me, you know,
[0:32:13] SPEAKER_01: where I'm still stuck. Like when I moved out of Florida, you know, all of you listening were kind
[0:32:19] Unknown: of with us on this journey. But it was a very hard movement for me because I had to disappoint my
[0:32:25] SPEAKER_01: parents. I had to move into an action that they would formally have claimed as selfish. And I had
[0:32:32] SPEAKER_01: to bring up all of these levels of like saying no and cutting an umbilical cord that intellectually,
[0:32:39] Unknown: of course, I'd already gotten over. But literally and physically and energetically, I was still
[0:32:46] SPEAKER_01: working with and I accomplish it. And it's great. And it's like, oh my God. And actually things
[0:32:51] SPEAKER_01: turned out wonderful. And my parents have been wonderful and I've been wonderful. And then my
[0:32:56] Unknown: dad gets sick. And I'm like, can I really stay in Austin when my dad's sick? Like, but they're
[0:33:02] SPEAKER_01: going to need me. And it's like, you know, I was just saying, Kieran, the other day, it's like,
[0:33:06] SPEAKER_01: as if I graduated college, now I'm on master's level with this issue, you know, it's ever
[0:33:11] Unknown: unfolding. And it's not kind to think that this is something you can do overnight, because
[0:33:19] Unknown: for many people, they've doled their connection to the answer of what's their yes. That's why it's
[0:33:26] SPEAKER_01: quite masterful work, like we've said all the time. You have a saying about this, something about a
[0:33:31] Unknown: ninja level. It's extreme ninja warrior level. Yes. Yeah, that thing. So I think, you know,
[0:33:38] SPEAKER_01: as you're beginning to work with this, recognize that it's going to be a process that sometimes
[0:33:43] SPEAKER_01: you don't know until your boundaries have collapsed and you're upset. And that's pretty
[0:33:48] SPEAKER_01: par for the course. And that may happen 100 times before something changes or maybe just once.
[0:33:56] Unknown: You know, that's just dependent, but recognize that that's going to happen. And then all of these
[0:34:01] SPEAKER_01: different tools Brooke and I are talking about are the different ways you'll get into understanding
[0:34:07] SPEAKER_01: this, like the architecture of this movement of collapse of your boundary for the sake of,
[0:34:14] SPEAKER_01: you'll get to know it in much, much, much closer detail. And awareness always does what awareness
[0:34:19] Unknown: does. It will soften it and it will unravel it because you know how awareness is, right?
[0:34:26] Unknown: Then you can't take your eye off it anymore. Yeah. Then you're like, I did it again. Yeah,
[0:34:30] SPEAKER_00: I know. And you're like, ah, what was the, where was the place? Where was the place I got
[0:34:35] Unknown: hooked? Like what was the, what was the slightly different thought that I tripped over this time,
[0:34:43] SPEAKER_00: which was different from last time. And yeah, and it just keeps, keeps coming.
[0:34:49] SPEAKER_00: So I want to get into one other, you brought up kind of a big concept, which is an episode in and
[0:34:54] SPEAKER_00: of itself, but I want to just underline it a little bit because it's at least helpful as just a seed
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_00: that gets planted. And it's, you know, it's like a little tiny sapling over in my soil, you know,
[0:35:08] SPEAKER_00: so this is something that's really growing in me as well. Which is that when you do what's true for
[0:35:15] Unknown: you, it's what's best for everybody. Y'all just, they're going to have to work with us on this one
[0:35:22] Unknown: because it's a sapling in my soil too. I see it. Yeah, I see it now. Before I was like, that's a
[0:35:28] SPEAKER_00: bunch of bullshit. Like that's just so that I don't feel bad when I disappoint people.
[0:35:34] SPEAKER_00: You're just telling me that and it's like, no, it's true. It's really interesting. So I had somebody
[0:35:42] Unknown: ask me the other day for advice. It's a word that I'm always like, my office mate, Ellen says, never,
[0:35:50] SPEAKER_00: never give someone advice unless they ask for it four times. So I told this person that, and then
[0:35:57] SPEAKER_00: I did wind up giving them advice, but the advice more or less, you know, they were asking how they
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_00: could affect the outcome of someone's life that was not their own and somebody's life who had not
[0:36:08] SPEAKER_00: asked them at all for help. And they were not suffering with what was going on with them. This
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_00: person was suffering with what they observed in that person. And so it's like the only advice I
[0:36:18] Unknown: could give, and I give this all the time, is like the helper types. And I put myself in that basket,
[0:36:24] Unknown: you know, I'm somebody who's been heavily conditioned to be a helper. We do so much more
[0:36:30] Unknown: good when we stay in our own lane, you know, and when we have faith in the people around us,
[0:36:38] SPEAKER_00: that they are God too, you know, that life is moving through them too, just as much as it is
[0:36:43] SPEAKER_00: through us, and that it's not up to us to control or fix or catch or, you know, and really we just,
[0:36:52] Unknown: we disable so much of what can be like a beautiful opportunity for people when we pretend that we're
[0:37:01] Unknown: able to like affect other people's lives. So just, you don't have to necessarily believe that
[0:37:08] SPEAKER_00: whenever you do what's true for you, it's going to be all, and I'm certainly not saying like in the
[0:37:12] SPEAKER_00: errand truck couch example, that if you said no, that person would be like, you know what,
[0:37:17] SPEAKER_00: I actually did thank you. Thank you. I didn't want that. And I didn't realize it until you said it.
[0:37:22] SPEAKER_00: No, like people will be pissy. People get hurt feelings. People get broken hearts. All those
[0:37:27] SPEAKER_00: things will happen. But it is what is in everyone's best interest for all of us to operate a lot more
[0:37:34] Unknown: from really genuine truth. So just tinker. There is a real simple way that I came to understand this,
[0:37:45] SPEAKER_01: and it is client work was always just an easy way to see it because it's not loaded the way family
[0:37:50] SPEAKER_01: work would be. But it happens with family stuff too. And I've addressed this before. So as long
[0:37:57] SPEAKER_01: as I think I'm obligated to because of some pain body movement within my system, then when someone
[0:38:04] Unknown: just asks for what they need or want or would like, they've already been a hassle. Like, oh,
[0:38:12] SPEAKER_01: you just asking me this means I have to go through this whole process. And I'm probably going to have
[0:38:18] SPEAKER_01: to say yes, because that's what I have to do. And now I'm like kind of pissed because you put me in
[0:38:23] SPEAKER_01: a position and I got to think about it. And then I'm gonna have to say yes. And now I have to do
[0:38:26] SPEAKER_01: this thing. And I didn't even want to do this thing. Right. That's what like, everyone likes
[0:38:32] SPEAKER_01: to think they're not a victim. But on some level, that is a victim stance, because it's a victim to
[0:38:37] SPEAKER_01: our own belief system. Right. So here I am. And I'm a victim to my own belief system. When someone
[0:38:42] Unknown: asks me, it's like, Oh, now I got to say yes. Well, okay. I think it's very obvious the levels
[0:38:49] Unknown: of suffering that that would create within me. Right. I mean, so Banfu Soma used to say,
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_01: if you give away your power, someone else will take it and they will use it poorly.
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_01: And then you will be upset. Yes. And it happens all the time. And she said, you know, because they
[0:39:06] Unknown: don't know how to use your power. They don't know what's best for you. Right. And so in that case,
[0:39:12] Unknown: it's like, okay, so I now feel obligated and I feel stuck. Now I'm pissy or I'm tired. Well,
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_00: is that what that person wanted for me? Right. Exactly. Like in a very straightforward way. Now
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_00: they're spending their Saturday moving their couch with some pissy, exhausted, resentful person.
[0:39:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Or like, or they find out later, I did a great job of covering it up while they were there.
[0:39:37] SPEAKER_01: But afterwards I went home and like threw my arm over my head and was like, oh,
[0:39:42] SPEAKER_01: life is so hard. And like, I'm always alone or, or maybe I got like resentful. So the next time
[0:39:49] Unknown: that client came in, I might like bristle, like, you know, and I don't, maybe I don't touch them
[0:39:56] SPEAKER_01: the same way. This is, this is so long ago. I'm really talking about my acupuncture practice more
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_01: than anything. So it's like, then maybe I don't touch them. Maybe I touch them with resentment
[0:40:04] SPEAKER_01: in my hands, you know, as hard as I try not to. So all of these different ways, because we're
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_01: connected, because of our mirror neurons, because of our empathic wiring, where we are one, we are
[0:40:17] SPEAKER_01: genuinely one, people feel these movements. I mean, my mom could feel when I was so upset with her
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: for like having a need of me, which was the most natural need she had, cause she's a mom and it was
[0:40:29] SPEAKER_01: really for love and connection. But it was like, I always took it to me and I had to be near her or
[0:40:35] SPEAKER_01: I had to do what she wanted. And so then I would feel angry and then I'd be like, how could she put
[0:40:41] SPEAKER_01: that on me? And all of these like distortions in the field, right? And then I would be defended
[0:40:48] Unknown: against her and then she would feel that. And that was shitty. Now she doesn't understand exactly why
[0:40:54] SPEAKER_01: she's feeling that. So guess what she did? She'd come in closer. Oh, for fuck's sake. Now she wants
[0:40:58] SPEAKER_01: more, right? And then, uh, the distortion in the field and like it goes on and on.
[0:41:05] SPEAKER_01: And it turns out that when I started moving from truth, not from anything else, now we have
[0:41:10] Unknown: connection and now we're closer. So now there's not that same level of clinginess because I'm there.
[0:41:16] Unknown: I'm actually present because I get to exist, right? To say yes and no. It's our most basic
[0:41:23] Unknown: affirmation of our existence. Don't you think? It's like, I have the right to move in,
[0:41:31] SPEAKER_01: in a way that feels really true and nourishing. I get to take care of my body. I get to take care
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_01: of my mind. I get to give from, from real generosity of spirit, not from obligation. I get to
[0:41:44] SPEAKER_01: do all of it. My yes and no is my right to exist just as I am. And when we
[0:41:50] SPEAKER_01: believe somewhere along the way that we had to abdicate it,
[0:41:56] SPEAKER_01: I think it just winds up creating these ripples into our relationships.
[0:42:01] SPEAKER_01: Where friends feel like pains in the asses just for having asked you.
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_00: Right. Because you're not minding your own boundaries and they're supposed to do it for you.
[0:42:09] SPEAKER_00: What? Like all they did was ask, can you move, help me move my couch? You know?
[0:42:12] SPEAKER_01: Right. And now you're like, that's so annoying in your body and they feel it. If they're a little
[0:42:17] SPEAKER_01: sensitive and if they're not a little sensitive, they feel it and they just don't understand
[0:42:22] SPEAKER_01: what's happening and all of these levels at which the distortions can occur. And
[0:42:29] Unknown: I think compassion is the secret sauce for all of this. Recognizing that we've all been domesticated.
[0:42:38] SPEAKER_01: We all have this kind of conditioning. We all are living in the illusion that we're not connected.
[0:42:47] SPEAKER_01: We're living in the illusion that if I keep moving in a contorted rhythm that's not for my highest,
[0:42:55] SPEAKER_01: that's not aligned with my natural gait, that that won't affect everybody around me. That that's what
[0:43:00] SPEAKER_01: people want from me even. Right? Like that's the imagining. Like, ooh, is it Brooke going to like
[0:43:06] SPEAKER_01: it if I keep jerking to the left and like twisting and turning my head? And it's like, no, it feels
[0:43:12] SPEAKER_01: really shitty to be Brooke on the other side of that movement. Just move and flow and walk and it
[0:43:17] Unknown: will feel really nice to be Brooke. And maybe she won't like my no, but maybe if I give her that no,
[0:43:23] SPEAKER_01: it'll give her permission to give someone else a no. I don't really know what it'll invite for her.
[0:43:27] Unknown: That part's not my business, but I can trust, like we've said, truth heals.
