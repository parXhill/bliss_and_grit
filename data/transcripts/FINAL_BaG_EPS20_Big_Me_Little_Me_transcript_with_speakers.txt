[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You're listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Brooke Thomas and I'm going
[0:00:11] SPEAKER_01: to be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host, Vanessa Escato. On this show, we're talking
[0:00:16] SPEAKER_01: about being on the embodied spiritual path and what that even means. What is a real evolution
[0:00:22] SPEAKER_01: of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything, all the beauty and crazy, the
[0:00:26] SPEAKER_01: joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life? And we are attempting to sort that
[0:00:31] SPEAKER_01: out for ourselves here on the show. Today's episode is another Dear Bliss and Grit show,
[0:00:36] SPEAKER_01: so it's one where we are answering a listener's question. This listener is talking about how
[0:00:42] SPEAKER_01: beneficial meditation has been in her life and she asks about how she can keep that expanded state
[0:00:49] SPEAKER_01: while off the cushion and not keep returning to what she calls the littleness lie. I think it's
[0:00:54] SPEAKER_01: a common feeling that many of us can bump up against and Vanessa and I are certainly not strangers
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_01: to it. We talk about the insights we have gleaned, our own frustrations with the twists and turns of
[0:01:05] SPEAKER_01: the path, and we ponder, as usual, what are we even up to here? If you're enjoying the show,
[0:01:11] SPEAKER_01: you'll be totally delighted if you left a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_01: and Grit. You can also go over to the website, blissandgrit.com, and subscribe to get email
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_01: updates on any upcoming events we might have and we are definitely brewing up goodies there.
[0:01:29] SPEAKER_01: One last note before we head into the conversation, we have a little bit of potty mouth,
[0:01:33] SPEAKER_01: so you might want to wear headphones if children are around. Okay, here we go.
[0:01:40] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so today let's do another Dear Bliss and Grit because we got a question that I thought
[0:01:48] SPEAKER_00: would be interesting for us to explore getting a little more into the meditation side of things,
[0:01:53] SPEAKER_00: which we actually have gotten quite a few questions on meditation that maybe one day we'll just do a
[0:01:59] Unknown: special on. Okay, but here's the question, Brooke. So our listener says, I have a question that maybe
[0:02:07] SPEAKER_00: you can help me with. I've been meditating on a daily basis for the past two months,
[0:02:12] SPEAKER_00: mostly twice a day. The results I've seen have been amazing, lighter, carefree. I move with intention.
[0:02:20] SPEAKER_00: I feel like my breath is guiding my life. After I finish meditating, I catch my mind coming to the
[0:02:28] Unknown: littleness lie I get in instead of being out of it. So my question is, how can I stop coming back to
[0:02:37] Unknown: those little thoughts that are so meaningless? I love it. It's so, it's a question we all
[0:02:49] SPEAKER_01: wrestle with. So good news, bad news, you're not alone. Bad news. This is on everyone's plate
[0:03:01] SPEAKER_01: long term. In fact, I've been listening to Adyashanti, who I really think is one of the most
[0:03:06] Unknown: sincere, living spiritual teachers right now. And I've been listening to his audio program,
[0:03:12] SPEAKER_01: The End of Your World about enlightenment. So here's somebody who's had a very authentic,
[0:03:18] SPEAKER_01: very complete realization or awakening, complete being obviously a tricky word, but he's quite
[0:03:26] SPEAKER_01: awake. And he talks about how, you know, after his initial sort of big, the fuse blew and he
[0:03:34] Unknown: couldn't go back in the box awakening, people have this idea that now you have this completely
[0:03:40] SPEAKER_01: clear and free mind and the thoughts don't arise anymore. And that's really not true. You know,
[0:03:46] SPEAKER_01: the thoughts arise and many very awake spiritual teachers have talked about this. You know, the
[0:03:52] SPEAKER_01: thoughts continue to happen. The mind continues to do its thing. The difference is that hopefully
[0:04:00] SPEAKER_01: over many years of practice, you know, for those of us who are meditators and are not completely
[0:04:04] Unknown: awake beings, hopefully we just don't identify with the thoughts as much. So even he was saying
[0:04:13] SPEAKER_01: after this really profound awakening, he would have the thought and he would get really interested
[0:04:17] SPEAKER_01: in the thought. And he would sit down and write the thought down and really just be very, very
[0:04:24] SPEAKER_01: curious. Like, oh, okay, good. Ooh, here's another thought that I usually used to identify with.
[0:04:29] SPEAKER_01: What is it? Like what, and what is the thought behind the thought? And what is the thought
[0:04:31] Unknown: behind the thought? So instead of treating it like shouldn't be happening in some way, shape or form,
[0:04:41] SPEAKER_01: it was this really genuine sort of excited curiosity about the thoughts. So there's tons
[0:04:47] SPEAKER_01: to say about that. Like how do we approach the thoughts? But I just want to start with
[0:04:51] SPEAKER_01: the baseline idea that even people who've had very, very profound and complete awakenings,
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_01: it's not that these thoughts go away. It's not that we constantly inhabit this sort of
[0:05:07] SPEAKER_01: fantasy oasis space that we all talk about in the spiritual world. You know, I'm going to be,
[0:05:12] SPEAKER_01: I'm never going to suffer. I'm never going to feel pain. Bad things won't happen to me. Or
[0:05:18] SPEAKER_01: I'll just always be in this sort of place of complete peaceful equanimity. Like, no, I mean,
[0:05:27] SPEAKER_01: even, you know, read the New Testament and Jesus is like throwing shit fits on the temple steps
[0:05:32] SPEAKER_01: with people gambling in the temple, you know. So it's like, it's not that you become this completely
[0:05:38] SPEAKER_01: like floating on a cloud person. I think that's really important for us to hold that. So that
[0:05:43] SPEAKER_01: we're not chasing a fake ideal of spirituality and what spirituality means.
[0:05:51] SPEAKER_00: So much to say. My brain is having so many thoughts.
[0:05:59] SPEAKER_00: The first thing I was just thinking about, like from the most basic level, I always liked when
[0:06:02] Unknown: meditation teachers would talk about how, you know, your brain is an organ and thought as its
[0:06:08] SPEAKER_00: movement so that like your kidney pumps and filters water and your heart pumps and oxygenates
[0:06:15] Unknown: blood and your lungs breathe in air and your brain thinks and that these are just movements,
[0:06:23] SPEAKER_00: you know, of part of your human experience. And that always seemed very helpful to me as well,
[0:06:29] SPEAKER_00: just to think like this happens, you know, these are movements, you know, especially because
[0:06:34] SPEAKER_00: the more you use your brain, the more it thinks, right? The more you get kind of into that groove
[0:06:40] Unknown: of the thought stream. But I have a lot of thoughts. I kind of want to go into how it happens even in
[0:06:45] SPEAKER_00: a meditation session itself and then happens outside of meditation. But first, what do you
[0:06:51] SPEAKER_00: think about maybe defining what you mean by awakening? Because I feel like even as setting
[0:06:58] SPEAKER_00: it up with this conversation like Adi Ashanti and he's this awakened dude, you know how you and I
[0:07:04] SPEAKER_00: are always talking about like, geez, people seem to use that word awakening very broadly and maybe
[0:07:10] SPEAKER_00: too conveniently sometimes. So what is it we're saying? Because maybe that even sets up like if
[0:07:16] SPEAKER_00: this is supposed to be the ideal in a sense, I know we're not trying to make it that way. But
[0:07:21] SPEAKER_00: in other words, this is where we can evolve to as this awakened state where we can really be
[0:07:26] SPEAKER_00: disidentified even though we're thinking, what is that state we're talking about?
[0:07:31] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, figuring out what that actually is as opposed to the myriad of ideas that we all
[0:07:40] SPEAKER_01: have about what it is, is a constantly unfolding process for me. So I'm going to get it wrong.
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_01: But I hope I'll get it wrong in, you know, as well as possible. My current resting place with that
[0:07:54] SPEAKER_01: or my current exploration with that is that a completely awakened person is a person
[0:07:59] Unknown: who does not argue with reality at all. And so that does not mean no suffering. That does not
[0:08:10] SPEAKER_01: mean no emotion. It does not mean any of those things. What it means is that reality
[0:08:18] SPEAKER_01: is what's happening right now in each moment. So thoughts about the past and thoughts about
[0:08:23] SPEAKER_01: the future are just fantasies. And that whatever is happening is not the thoughts might arise,
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_01: but they don't, you don't believe the story the thought is telling you about them. This is going
[0:08:37] SPEAKER_01: to be a disaster. You remember what happened the last time this happened, you shouldn't do that
[0:08:41] SPEAKER_01: again. Or if it continues like this, it's going to ba ba ba ba. You know, we tell ourselves all these
[0:08:47] SPEAKER_01: stories that hold our identity in place. So the stories go away. And the only thing that's left
[0:08:51] Unknown: is a very genuine no argument relationship to reality. So that's my current understanding
[0:09:01] SPEAKER_01: of what this actually means as a non awakened person, which means I can't actually understand
[0:09:08] SPEAKER_01: it. You know, I can't actually know what it feels like to walk on the moon. I've never walked on the
[0:09:13] Unknown: moon, but I have some ideas based on seeing footage of people walking on the moon.
[0:09:19] SPEAKER_00: And having moments where we pop in and out of it for sure, as as we as we do. I think that's a
[0:09:25] SPEAKER_00: pretty good working definition. And perhaps we could add that what people say, you know, the people
[0:09:31] SPEAKER_00: who are talking about this experience, whether you're looking at ancient traditions like Buddhism or
[0:09:38] SPEAKER_00: or Taoism or something, or whether you're actually listening to some modern speakers,
[0:09:43] SPEAKER_00: like you can find at Buddha at the gas pump, plenty of people talking about their stories,
[0:09:48] SPEAKER_00: is that as their what did you say, not in resistance to reality, like there's no argument.
[0:09:54] SPEAKER_00: So as they're seeing reality clearly without their lenses of the past or their projections
[0:10:00] Unknown: of the future, they seem to notice that we're all one. That seems to be, you know, a recurring
[0:10:06] SPEAKER_00: theme that arises with it. Yes, the interconnectedness of things, interdependency. Okay.
[0:10:12] Unknown: So so far, what we haven't said is that when people are awakened, they're all happy, happy,
[0:10:20] Unknown: joy, joy, bliss, bliss. Right. Right. Not that. Not that. And that seems to be super missing from
[0:10:28] SPEAKER_00: the material on enlightenment in general. Yeah. So it's not that we're just missing that because
[0:10:35] SPEAKER_00: we're all gritty and shit. It seems to be not spoken about. Now, there are some things that
[0:10:42] SPEAKER_00: are some spiritual traditions that will talk about how like if you awaken and you're enlightened,
[0:10:46] SPEAKER_00: you'll be in a blissful state. You will get that. I believe Hinduism has a lot of bliss built into
[0:10:52] Unknown: the kind of like highest level of evolution. As a Buddhist myself, always with my Buddhist slant
[0:11:01] Unknown: on things, I go back to what John Wellwood had taught me that if your heart was fully opened,
[0:11:08] SPEAKER_00: which to be awakened and to be meeting reality, I do think that's also part of the movement as
[0:11:14] Unknown: your heart is open. Yeah. And that if your heart was open, the Buddhist would say there's a certain
[0:11:19] Unknown: state, it's an emotion you would experience called sad joy. All one word, no differentiation.
[0:11:28] Unknown: Because he said, if you were watching reality, you would immediately feel sadness because there
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_00: are people suffering everywhere. And it doesn't matter that in some formless way, everything is
[0:11:39] SPEAKER_00: God, you know, or it's all one, you know, in the world of form, you're watching pain and suffering
[0:11:45] Unknown: and death and dying and much of it needless. You're seeing human tendencies. And so you would
[0:11:50] SPEAKER_00: immediately feel some measure of sadness of passing even because we're quite aware that
[0:11:55] SPEAKER_00: everything's always passing. But you would also immediately feel so much joy because you would
[0:12:01] SPEAKER_00: see the beauty and the exquisite ness of the sunset and the trees and of humans and how they
[0:12:06] SPEAKER_00: try and how they love and how they share and like that would also be there. And so it would be this
[0:12:11] SPEAKER_00: whole kind of bittersweet cacophony of like exquisite experience, which I have felt. Have
[0:12:18] Unknown: you felt that before sad joy? Yeah. Now, so I don't know what it's like, but when you listen to people
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_00: and when I've had my own experiences, it's a lot. It's a lot like that. It's it's, um,
[0:12:32] Unknown: multi-textural. It's not just I'm expanded on this high. Yeah. You know, it is this multi-textural
[0:12:42] SPEAKER_00: experience of kind of peaceful, but sort of excited and a little bit of joy and like a little bit of
[0:12:49] Unknown: grief and sorrow. And it's this like mix. And, um, and I guess the reason why I'm talking about this
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_00: is that there's two things to this question that I could start to look at. The first is what do I do
[0:13:05] SPEAKER_00: about my thoughts? You know, I'm a thinker and like, I have this idea, typically a meditation,
[0:13:10] SPEAKER_00: thoughts are problematic. So they keep coming. What am I supposed to do about them? So the first
[0:13:14] SPEAKER_00: question part of it here is about thoughts and how do we navigate the thoughts that are arising.
[0:13:19] Unknown: But the second part to me kind of feels like, aren't we supposed to be able to stay expansive?
[0:13:26] SPEAKER_00: And why am I snapping back into the little self and the thoughts that come with the little self?
[0:13:31] Unknown: Did, did you kind of hear that? Totally. Yeah. Okay. So I guess I'm starting to talk about like
[0:13:37] SPEAKER_00: what we can expect, like is staying in an expanded state, even something
[0:13:44] SPEAKER_00: uh, natural for us to imagine as being possible. Yeah. And I think that that idea of the expanded
[0:13:51] Unknown: state is a very common sort of spiritual ego making exercise, you know, so we suffer,
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_01: we all suffer as part of the human condition. And any of us who are on this path, not always,
[0:14:04] SPEAKER_01: but I would say 95% of the time we got here because suffering brought us to the table.
[0:14:10] Unknown: Um, life got really painful and we felt, um, let down by our thoughts, you know, that, that we,
[0:14:21] SPEAKER_01: our, our version of reality wasn't serving us maybe, you know, we were in a lot of pain.
[0:14:26] SPEAKER_01: And so people can get on this path sometimes thinking, oh, thank God. And I am so guilty of
[0:14:33] SPEAKER_01: this. And it's something I'm really trying to be very conscious about struggling with right now.
[0:14:36] SPEAKER_01: Oh, thank God there's a, there is a get out of jail free card. You know, there is this place I
[0:14:42] SPEAKER_01: can go call the spiritual path where I don't have to be a part of humanity anymore.
[0:14:47] SPEAKER_01: Oh, girl, you know, it's my favorite Nirvana forever.
[0:14:53] SPEAKER_01: So I think that most of us, I would say on the path, we, we want that. And for me, you know,
[0:15:01] SPEAKER_01: and particularly right now watching world events and our disgusting president elect,
[0:15:10] SPEAKER_01: how do you really feel? I feel like he's disgusting. And so it, what winds up happening for me is it
[0:15:16] SPEAKER_01: goes into what's been a childhood pattern of like our species is disgusting. And I want out,
[0:15:22] Unknown: you know, I'm sick of seeing the ways that we cause pain and suffering.
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_01: The thing is that if you get on the spiritual path and you're really sincere about it, what you
[0:15:32] SPEAKER_01: realize is that it's not a get out of jail free card. You can pretend, you know, you can wear the
[0:15:38] SPEAKER_01: mask of what you've decided a spiritual person is, which is just a fresh face of ego. But really,
[0:15:46] SPEAKER_01: what we're trying to do is to see reality. So to meet what's actually there and what's actually
[0:15:52] SPEAKER_01: there is quite a lot of, you know, suffering and pain and all the thoughts that hold that in place.
[0:16:00] SPEAKER_01: And then also upon unhooking from that, there is unconditional love and realizing like, oh my God,
[0:16:08] SPEAKER_01: there's this whole other thing that I'm just not doing most of the time that happens, you know,
[0:16:12] SPEAKER_01: that just flows through. So it's, it's about meeting what's really there. It's, it's not,
[0:16:21] SPEAKER_01: I get to be in the expanded state all the time. I mean, there is expanded state all the time,
[0:16:26] SPEAKER_01: which is awakening, but I just don't think that that is what we like to pretend that it is.
[0:16:33] SPEAKER_00: Well, even with, with that, who's that guy who talked about waking up, waking in, waking out?
[0:16:41] Unknown: Locke Kelly. Locke Kelly, y'all. Locke Kelly has got some good words. He's got some interesting
[0:16:48] SPEAKER_00: things to say. Well, okay. So Locke Kelly would talk about that. There's these different movements
[0:16:53] SPEAKER_00: of awakening. You wake up, you wake in, you wake out. Waking up is like recognizing transcendence
[0:16:59] Unknown: and the movement of transcendence, oneness, divinity, that kind of a state. Waking in is
[0:17:06] SPEAKER_00: embodiment. And I always like to think in and down. So it's embodiment and the earth and like
[0:17:12] SPEAKER_00: connecting with our, with our earth. That's always how I like to think about it. That's not what he
[0:17:16] SPEAKER_00: said. And then waking out, which is this heart space, this connection with everybody, this very
[0:17:23] SPEAKER_00: deep interconnectivity and oneness, compassion, and all of those things that come in the heart space.
[0:17:29] SPEAKER_00: And that sometimes people can wake up to one and not another. And that in a way, I mean, it's not a
[0:17:35] SPEAKER_00: bypass and like some judgy use of the word, but that there's like a piece of the story missing,
[0:17:41] SPEAKER_00: so to speak. Right. And, and you may all kind of recognize that for yourselves, just that there's
[0:17:46] SPEAKER_00: a movement that's easiest for you. Like maybe the movement, if you're listening to us is embodiment
[0:17:52] SPEAKER_00: and going inside or connecting to nature, but maybe you can't recognize like, like that kind
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_00: of expansiveness and transcendence that can come from waking up, or maybe you're great in the heart
[0:18:06] SPEAKER_00: space and like, you can really feel compassion, but you can't feel safe in your body and you can't
[0:18:12] SPEAKER_00: anchor in and make space for your feelings. Right. Like they're all just these different things. And
[0:18:17] SPEAKER_00: I think that's a great conversation and just kind of language to give us like a map to talk about,
[0:18:23] Unknown: because I think we all kind of hope that we can just wake up. Yeah. And then, yay. Freedom
[0:18:32] SPEAKER_01: consciousness all the time. Don't have to be human anymore. That sucked. And I can see my image. It's
[0:18:38] SPEAKER_00: like I'm huge. Like my, my, my being just dissolves into this thing, which by the way, we're actually
[0:18:46] SPEAKER_01: also super duper scared of our beings dissolved. Yeah, we love our, we're totally addicted to being
[0:18:53] SPEAKER_00: ourselves more than anything else. In this fantasy land, we'd like to be able to rise above things,
[0:18:58] SPEAKER_00: I guess, is, you know, we have that word rise above for a reason. We don't just mean rise above,
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_00: like, take the moral ground. I think we mean, like, don't feel those crappy ass feelings.
[0:19:11] Unknown: Be in this nirvanic kind of, kind of state. So I think that's a good kind of language to use,
[0:19:18] SPEAKER_00: like, how can we kind of hit these different levels within ourselves and open them up and
[0:19:24] SPEAKER_00: find clarity there. But it got me thinking about, do y'all know Mathieu Ricard, the happiest man on
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_00: earth? Do you know Mathieu Ricard, the happiest man on earth? No, no. I wish I could be the happiest
[0:19:37] SPEAKER_00: anything on earth. I mean, okay, so let me tell you about Mathieu. Mathieu is a French man. But he,
[0:19:45] SPEAKER_00: he lives in, I think Nepal now. He's a Buddhist monk. They call him the happiest man on earth,
[0:19:51] SPEAKER_00: because they've hooked him up to all sorts of electrodes and whatnot that prove that he
[0:19:56] SPEAKER_00: has a brain that is completely happy and equanimous. And don't ask me to do how they prove it. But there
[0:20:02] Unknown: is so much writing on this. This is like Daniel Goleman and destructive emotions and all the people
[0:20:08] Unknown: who are kind of measuring the impact of meditation on the brain. So I think about this man, this
[0:20:16] SPEAKER_00: happiest man on earth, and they clearly meditation affected something like they can see it on a
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_00: neurobiological level. And you can see it with a lot of meditators, you can see that your brain
[0:20:26] SPEAKER_00: will go more towards optimism, more towards joy, more towards compassion, more towards gratitude.
[0:20:31] SPEAKER_00: And these are states that we would consider more exalted, we would certainly also consider them a
[0:20:36] SPEAKER_00: little more pleasant to be in than other emotional states, more desirable, therefore for us as humans.
[0:20:43] Unknown: So, you know, that can be seen. So one thing we do know is that in fact, meditation is creating
[0:20:52] Unknown: a happier, more connected state, even physiologically, and certainly people will
[0:20:59] Unknown: speak about that, they'll articulate it. And then also this dude seems to be like, really chill about
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_00: life, you know, really happy. He really has that equanimity that Buddhists talk about, which isn't
[0:21:11] SPEAKER_00: the same as expansiveness, right? Yeah, and probably we should say that not that y'all have
[0:21:16] SPEAKER_00: to care what the Buddhists say. We're just it's a roadmap and I care. It's um, they were never
[0:21:24] SPEAKER_00: talking about, like being jumping for joy, happy and expanded, knowing that everything is God and
[0:21:30] SPEAKER_00: never having a thought. Yeah, they were talking about like finding this even place where you can
[0:21:36] SPEAKER_00: make space for everything, right? Which is not arguing with reality. Which is not arguing with
[0:21:41] SPEAKER_00: reality. And like this guy is the happiest man on earth, but like he lives in a little kind of like
[0:21:49] SPEAKER_00: tent with no belongings in Nepal. So then the question is like, in my mind, like, do we all
[0:21:55] Unknown: have to do that in order to be happy? I think not. I think we all get to still be a certain
[0:22:04] SPEAKER_01: flavor of who we are, even once the I thought dissolves, just fodder for another episode.
[0:22:12] SPEAKER_00: But I am not sure I'm this is an honest exploration. And again, probably another episode.
[0:22:20] SPEAKER_00: But my honest exploration was, you know, once we know, like, okay, so if we're in this human form,
[0:22:25] SPEAKER_00: and there are some preferences, even though we can know we're more than that, but we have these
[0:22:30] SPEAKER_00: preferences, once you've gotten exposed to all these like goodies, if you're in the world of
[0:22:35] SPEAKER_00: goodies and treatsies, will you ever find that same level of equanimity? Like, I don't care. I'm
[0:22:40] SPEAKER_00: sure you can. I'm saying it out loud, and I'm sure you can. Maybe I just can't. Not yet.
[0:22:48] Unknown: Well, it's a piece that's still right. You all too on that.
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_01: Right in. Let us know your findings.
[0:22:55] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. My friend, I'm thinking about my friend, Christina, who's on a very sincere path.
[0:23:04] SPEAKER_01: And she was talking about where she's at with heart opening, which is my big challenge,
[0:23:10] Unknown: obviously, right? If I go to this place where it's like, everything's we're all so disgusting,
[0:23:15] SPEAKER_01: right? Like, obviously, heart opening challenge, not my wheelhouse, right? So she was talking about
[0:23:22] SPEAKER_01: this massive heart opening that she had, I don't know, maybe a year ago, and it just hasn't gone
[0:23:26] SPEAKER_01: away where she can. And what it means is that she moves. It doesn't mean that she's more distant.
[0:23:32] SPEAKER_01: It actually means that she moves closer. She wants to get closer to suffering because it doesn't hook.
[0:23:37] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't feel as she described it as barbed wire wrapping around her heart anymore. If somebody,
[0:23:43] SPEAKER_01: if she's presented with someone else's suffering, there's just all this space.
[0:23:47] SPEAKER_01: And so if there's all this space, then you don't have to be afraid of how you'll feel when you sit
[0:23:51] SPEAKER_01: with somebody else's suffering or your own. And you just meet it and it's just love. And I'm like,
[0:23:57] Unknown: well, shit, I want that, you know? That's not my experience right now. And so as she was describing
[0:24:04] Unknown: it, she's like, so now when I see either my own suffering arises as a thought, or somebody else's
[0:24:11] SPEAKER_01: suffering in the form of a person in my life telling me a story or having an experience that
[0:24:16] Unknown: I'm witnessing, she said, I just want to eat the porcupine. She's like, I see it and it's all sharp
[0:24:23] SPEAKER_01: and jagged and I just want to eat it. I just want to take it in and digest it because I know inside
[0:24:30] SPEAKER_01: there's all this space now. And I'm like, man, that sounds awesome. You know? So, but that's
[0:24:36] SPEAKER_01: a description of like, you move towards actually, I think in a genuine awakening process, you move
[0:24:43] SPEAKER_01: towards the suffering more because you have the space to not get hooked by it. You don't have to
[0:24:47] SPEAKER_01: be afraid that you're going to feel like shit for three weeks if you hear somebody's horrifying
[0:24:53] SPEAKER_01: story about their traumatic experience. It just doesn't hook you and you can just love them.
[0:25:01] SPEAKER_00: That's like real compassion. I think I posted something on social media not too long ago. I was
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: differentiating between idiot compassion and real compassion. Yeah, I love that thought. It's so
[0:25:11] SPEAKER_00: helpful. God bless Buddhists and just being so honest and calling it idiot compassion.
[0:25:16] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, right. Or Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche who didn't mince words so much. That one I actually
[0:25:22] Unknown: think I got from Robert Thurman. Oh, okay. Nice. But I think it's really just like a proper traditional
[0:25:29] SPEAKER_00: Buddhist thing. But anyway, you know, so idiot compassion is really enabling people or the
[0:25:36] SPEAKER_00: belief that we're responsible for the suffering. It's like enabling their small self instead of
[0:25:42] Unknown: seeing truth, right? That they're God and it's fine and it's all okay and holding space from them
[0:25:48] SPEAKER_00: for that higher experience and making space for them to come into their fullness. So it got me
[0:25:54] SPEAKER_00: thinking like, I think a lot of us can get stuck in all of those belief systems. It's why our heart
[0:25:58] SPEAKER_00: can stay closed, right? It's like, because I have a belief system of someone suffering, I have to do
[0:26:03] SPEAKER_00: something about it. I don't see them for what they really are. So I feel never-endingly bad about it.
[0:26:09] SPEAKER_00: Like I can't get the whole big picture into my system. I think it's my job to save the world.
[0:26:15] SPEAKER_00: I mean, all sorts of weird things can go into that moment like backstories. But you know,
[0:26:20] Unknown: I was thinking about how, okay, so if you look at the neurobiology, I think it's the left prefrontal
[0:26:26] SPEAKER_00: cortex and the right prefrontal cortex. So the left prefrontal cortex is the area where
[0:26:31] SPEAKER_00: you experience these, as I was saying prior, what we might think of as exalted or happy states.
[0:26:37] SPEAKER_00: You know, pleasure, joy, connection, love, compassion, gratitude, optimism. And the right
[0:26:47] SPEAKER_00: prefrontal cortex is where you experience things like anger and sadness and grief and frustration
[0:26:53] SPEAKER_00: and anxiety. Okay? So there is something about the more you go in one direction, the more you go in
[0:26:59] SPEAKER_00: that direction. Right? And that's where things like mindfulness and meditation exercises and
[0:27:06] Unknown: practices can be useful and actually for a fact can change the brain. Right? With that we've seen
[0:27:13] Unknown: with multiple studies with MRIs. And I think it's in part why, for example, the Buddhists will use
[0:27:21] SPEAKER_00: compassion or gratitude as an entryway. What I mean is they never try to just use happiness,
[0:27:31] SPEAKER_00: for example, or expansiveness or bliss as an entryway. They use these states that are so real
[0:27:41] SPEAKER_00: that have a way of recognizing the whole shebang, the bliss and the grit all at once. Right? So
[0:27:47] SPEAKER_00: compassion. I don't have to deny that anyone's suffering. I don't have to deny that I'm suffering,
[0:27:52] SPEAKER_00: but I can still have this sweet feeling that opens my heart and feels very alive without denying
[0:27:59] SPEAKER_00: anything. And I can do the same with gratitude. I mean, I can be ever grateful and it can make
[0:28:04] SPEAKER_00: my heart want to burst open without having to deny that part of why I'm grateful is this is
[0:28:09] SPEAKER_00: happening in the world and that's happening in the world. And I recognize how lucky I am and,
[0:28:12] Unknown: you know, all of these different things. So I think it's why you can do compassion meditations
[0:28:20] SPEAKER_00: and you can do gratitude meditations. And what you're actually doing is training for happiness,
[0:28:26] SPEAKER_00: training for more joy, training for more bliss, because the more you work that groove, the more
[0:28:31] Unknown: it opens you up into those states of being. And of course, once those states of being become like
[0:28:37] SPEAKER_00: your go-to, they will change your thought processes to some degree. Right? Because
[0:28:44] Unknown: let's think about anxiety. So you and I have spoken about anxiety. Remember the time when you
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_00: were telling the story about how you'd sit in bed thinking like everything's falling apart and
[0:28:54] SPEAKER_00: nothing's okay, but you're sitting in your cozy bed and-
[0:28:57] Unknown: Oh, it seems like so long ago, who can remember? I'm just kidding. Yeah. I'm familiar with that
[0:29:02] SPEAKER_00: sensation. Right. Well, so the anxiety starts on that baseline physical level. It could even,
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_00: in this case, this is not your story, but for someone else, it could even be caused because
[0:29:12] SPEAKER_00: you drank five cups of coffee and, you know, you didn't eat all day. Sure. Right. But once that
[0:29:18] Unknown: physiological anxiety is stirring, it will create certain thoughts with it. Right? Yeah. What's the
[0:29:24] SPEAKER_00: matter? What is the matter? What's happening? Am I okay? Is this a- and then you'll start to look at
[0:29:29] SPEAKER_00: your job and you'll look at your boyfriend and you'll look at like your home life and you'll
[0:29:32] SPEAKER_00: start to assess all the problem spots. And it all started because that underlying state created a
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_00: thought sequence that it like best paired with. It's like what you're accustomed to. It's like
[0:29:44] Unknown: they were a perfect match. So to a certain extent, just doing meditation practices, especially if
[0:29:51] SPEAKER_00: you're working with things like compassion, if you're working with things like gratitude,
[0:29:55] Unknown: can start to rewire your movement so that you go towards that state of being more,
[0:30:02] SPEAKER_00: more than you had, and that invites a different thought process more so that you're not in such
[0:30:09] SPEAKER_00: little me thoughts. But that doesn't seem to be the end of the story. Or maybe it is if that's
[0:30:17] SPEAKER_00: what you do every day, four hours a day, you know, for years. But I don't know. What do you think?
[0:30:23] Unknown: Well, I think, I mean, we've addressed that the thoughts don't go away
[0:30:31] SPEAKER_01: unless you're at a very, very, very, very, very advanced enlightened place.
[0:30:40] SPEAKER_01: Which is really advanced. Right? So someone like Ama, who's basically just this avatar of like
[0:30:48] Unknown: pure love consciousness, right? I don't know. Maybe she doesn't have any thoughts that come
[0:30:53] SPEAKER_01: through. But I can also probably predict that I'm not going to wind up there in this lifetime.
[0:30:59] Unknown: Right? Like that's not what's up for Brooke right now. So the thoughts do arise. So what can we do
[0:31:05] Unknown: when they do arise? And I think first of all, the thing that just is such a relief is it's okay.
[0:31:12] SPEAKER_01: It's not a problem. It doesn't mean you're doing something wrong. And that's where all the grabby
[0:31:17] SPEAKER_01: hands comes in. No, this is bad. I'm judging this is bad. And the other experience I was having
[0:31:22] SPEAKER_01: when I was on the cushion as good and I need to grasp at the thing that was good. But, you know,
[0:31:28] SPEAKER_01: how many times do we have to see that shit just doesn't work out? And I'm talking to myself here
[0:31:33] SPEAKER_01: to not keep doing it, you know? So first of all, it's not bad news. It's not because you're falling
[0:31:40] Unknown: short in some way or on your spiritual path. That's very helpful. And then we can, you know,
[0:31:46] SPEAKER_01: what Adyashanti was describing and what everyone is describing is we can get kind of curious about
[0:31:52] SPEAKER_01: them and we can get loving about them so we can have so much compassion. We can just love the shit
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_01: out of those thoughts. And this is a challenge, you know, and this is really a challenge for me too.
[0:32:01] SPEAKER_01: For sure, for sure. Like it's up right now is there's still the impulse. No, bad. I do not want
[0:32:09] SPEAKER_01: to be having this thought again. I want it to go away. I don't want to have to feel it.
[0:32:13] SPEAKER_01: But with more practice, like you're talking about, meditation actually starts training our
[0:32:17] SPEAKER_01: brain so that we just have even the capacity to not judge that we're having a thought or what the
[0:32:24] SPEAKER_01: thought is, to not decide that it is us. So there's a little space between us and the thought and then
[0:32:30] SPEAKER_01: to very compassionately be really curious about it. And when we get really curious in a loving way
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_01: about these things, they do have a tendency eventually to pop like little soap bubbles.
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't feel like you're trying to pull, I'm going to be gross again. You get so mad when I do
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_01: this. It doesn't have to feel like you're trying to pull a leech off your skin, you know, it feels
[0:32:50] SPEAKER_01: more like popping a little soap bubble when you really finally get at the roots, which, you know,
[0:32:55] SPEAKER_01: takes a lot of brain training, AKA meditation.
[0:32:58] Unknown: Yeah, I don't know how to say this, like, quite clearly with my language, but you're getting at
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_00: something that I was thinking too. It's like, as if we can operate on two levels at the same time,
[0:33:11] SPEAKER_00: the first one is we're popping the soap bubbles, like we are just trying to like, train our brains,
[0:33:17] SPEAKER_00: understand better about ourselves, manage some emotions, regulate self, like, do these kinds of
[0:33:23] SPEAKER_00: things. And at the same time, as we're doing that, we're trying to pull the leeches off. So
[0:33:27] SPEAKER_00: disgusting. But like, we're also trying to get at what the belief systems are, and what the
[0:33:34] SPEAKER_00: expectations are, and what the intergenerational trauma is, and what all of these other, let's say,
[0:33:40] SPEAKER_00: deeper things are, that are at the base that are triggering, not just thoughts, but the forgetting
[0:33:46] SPEAKER_00: that you are sacred and divine. Because I think that's part of the problem. And I think that's
[0:33:52] SPEAKER_00: part of the problem is that these quote unquote, like little kind of thoughts that are arising,
[0:33:58] SPEAKER_00: that our listener was writing us about, it's like they're, they're so mundane. And there's this
[0:34:06] Unknown: forgetting of what an expansive being you are, I think sometimes too. And so it's like,
[0:34:12] SPEAKER_00: I think we're kind of working these both levels, like one, we're being very practical, and we're
[0:34:18] SPEAKER_00: going, okay, how do I meet anger differently? And how do I train my brain to move into gratitude
[0:34:24] SPEAKER_00: and compassion? And how do I learn to breathe when there's sadness and make space? And it's kind of
[0:34:29] SPEAKER_00: like that more management, quote unquote, of the human experience. And then at another level,
[0:34:37] Unknown: as we meditate, walking in life, as we bring awareness, as we bring heart and love, as you said,
[0:34:44] Unknown: to ourselves, both on the cushion and off, as we study, like our movements,
[0:34:50] Unknown: we're starting to get at the roots, the expectations, the beliefs, the ways that
[0:34:56] SPEAKER_00: we forget that we're sacred, the ways that we're caught in trances of unworthiness.
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_00: And I guess if we kind of work back and forth together, there's some like alchemical release,
[0:35:08] SPEAKER_00: where maybe the thoughts come a little less. I know for me, mostly what's happened is identify
[0:35:14] SPEAKER_00: a shit ton less with my thoughts, especially on the cushion, because the cushion is a funny place.
[0:35:19] SPEAKER_00: I know I'm just meditating, so I know not to pay attention to them. But when I'm out walking in the
[0:35:23] Unknown: world, those thoughts may seem more real, but I've learned certainly not to identify with them as
[0:35:29] SPEAKER_00: much. And I really think I have a lot less negative thoughts. That's not across the board. I'm
[0:35:34] SPEAKER_00: talking about my ratio, you know, like that I don't think so many fear based things, I don't
[0:35:40] SPEAKER_00: worry so much about, am I good enough? I don't have those thoughts anymore, because there's a
[0:35:44] SPEAKER_00: certain amount that as you work and you stay present and you make space for yourself to exist,
[0:35:49] Unknown: you just transform some of the roots of those thoughts. And that can like set you free.
[0:35:59] SPEAKER_00: But just the one last thing I want to add to this, because it keeps popping into my mind.
[0:36:03] Unknown: I remember having meditations where I'm sitting and meditating. So there's this kind of Tibetan
[0:36:09] SPEAKER_00: meditation you do. I was working with Chen Rezeg, who is Abhila, I can never say his,
[0:36:17] SPEAKER_00: I can never say his name. Forget it, just say the Tibetan, it's Chen Rezeg. And I'm doing these
[0:36:21] SPEAKER_00: meditations and you picture him and it's like a God sitting above everybody's head and in everybody's
[0:36:27] SPEAKER_00: heart. And he's in you and he's above you and you're him and everybody's him. And so it's this
[0:36:31] SPEAKER_00: really like it can be so beautiful, your heart can almost swell and burst in a way that feels
[0:36:37] SPEAKER_00: blissful, but a little bit too much, but you like yum yum. And then I'm doing that and like my whole
[0:36:44] SPEAKER_00: being is swelling with happiness. And then all of a sudden I'll be like, I wonder what I have in the
[0:36:48] SPEAKER_00: house for dinner. I didn't cook anything. And I'm like, wow, this is hilarious. How is it that
[0:36:57] Unknown: my thought stream could find that more interesting than this? Like exalted, wonderful, open state.
[0:37:06] SPEAKER_00: And I don't know. I don't really know. I just recognize the thought. I think it's hilarious
[0:37:14] SPEAKER_00: because I'm human and I'm all about being human. And then if I can, I come back to the breath,
[0:37:19] Unknown: I come back to the imagery and you work it all over again. So I think it's like
[0:37:27] SPEAKER_00: we told the story a little bit back about like Pema Chodron and saying how like she was really
[0:37:32] SPEAKER_00: suffering on this meditation retreat and like it was terrible. She was going through this tough
[0:37:37] SPEAKER_00: time and then she goes to her teacher and she's like, I've been having this terrible experience
[0:37:41] SPEAKER_00: of fear and da da da and all these emotions. And her teacher goes, oh, very good. You were
[0:37:46] Unknown: experiencing the Dakini bliss. And she's like, what? Oh, that's good. And then she couldn't wait
[0:37:52] SPEAKER_00: to experience again. She was so excited and then she never had it again. So some of it is just our
[0:37:59] SPEAKER_00: expectations. And as we go, we can relax. And then we recognize like, because we're present,
[0:38:06] SPEAKER_00: that just because you're having a little thought now doesn't mean in the very next moment, you may
[0:38:10] SPEAKER_00: not remember the truth of who you are. And then in the next moment, you may have a little thought.
[0:38:15] SPEAKER_00: And then for the next hundred moments, you may expand and wake up out in, you know, and then you
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_00: may have a thought. So it's almost like, I guess part of the process is not thinking that just
[0:38:28] Unknown: because you do it now, you'll always do it either way that just because you can taste reality now
[0:38:35] SPEAKER_00: that you can five minutes from now or 20 days from now. And just because you're stuck right now,
[0:38:41] SPEAKER_00: doesn't mean literally in two seconds, you can't feel the truth and like no transcendence, right?
[0:38:47] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. I was reading an article that someone forwarded recently, somebody sort of arguing with
[0:38:53] SPEAKER_01: all this stuff about mindfulness is always going to make everything the best, you know, she totally
[0:38:58] SPEAKER_01: threw out the baby with the bathwater, in my opinion. And she was like, I don't, you know,
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_01: basically kind of screw being in the now. Oh, great. Now I have to have a Pinterest worthy mind
[0:39:06] SPEAKER_01: as well as a beautiful Pinterest board. And I'm like, no, no, no, like, this isn't about
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_01: pretty shit up. Like it's about meeting whatever actually shows up. So and trying to do it in the
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_01: most loving and genuinely curious way possible. So take yourself out of the shame box of I need to
[0:39:23] Unknown: have this beautifully serene mind. And then and then see what's actually there. And that's when
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_01: shit gets exciting, actually, you know, when these constructs do fall away and life does start to
[0:39:37] SPEAKER_00: really legitimately change. Yeah, because that's really, I don't know, maybe it's just where I'm
[0:39:43] SPEAKER_00: at right now. That's the most beautiful part is learning how to welcome all of human experience.
[0:39:48] SPEAKER_00: You know, like Chagam Trungpa did used to say that you have to find the sacred in the mundane.
[0:39:55] SPEAKER_00: And that includes your thoughts includes going to the bathroom, it includes like the stupid
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_00: conversations you have to have it like a bank. And, you know, it's like, we only feel sometimes
[0:40:06] SPEAKER_00: like we can find the sacred if I'm up on top of a mountain living in a tent, you know, in Nepal or
[0:40:11] SPEAKER_00: something like that. And of course, it is it's easier to remember, it's easy to forget when like
[0:40:17] SPEAKER_00: the delusion of form is so dense, you know, around us. But you have to find the sacred in the mundane.
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_00: So like the tantrikas would really be so curious about the thought as you were saying,
[0:40:29] SPEAKER_00: Adiashanti isn't just this is divinity, like this is sacred, the thoughts are sacred. They're not
[0:40:36] SPEAKER_00: the bad other. They are the sacred coming through. And then so then if you could meet it like that,
[0:40:42] SPEAKER_00: you just may get what you were looking for. You just may taste what you were looking for.
[0:40:47] SPEAKER_00: But as we wrap this up, Brooke, you know what story keeps popping into my mind?
[0:40:52] SPEAKER_00: Remember when we were at the Dharma Ocean retreat, and one of our classmates stood up and said to our
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_00: dear beloved Tammy Simon, you know, something like what's the point of doing all this if you're
[0:41:02] SPEAKER_00: still going to think like even Pema Chodron says she still thinks right because for those of you
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_00: who are listening Pema Chodron's a quite a wonderful teacher and a Buddhist nun and Pema Chodron says
[0:41:12] SPEAKER_00: like her brain is an organ and she has a very active one. You know, a lot of you may the almost
[0:41:17] SPEAKER_00: the more intellectual you are, the more active your brain just is in part because you use it all day,
[0:41:24] Unknown: but in part that's like just part of your brain. How it is just like I have brown hair, you know.
[0:41:30] SPEAKER_00: So, Pema Chodron said that she still thinks quite a bit. She just doesn't the thoughts just come and
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_00: go. She doesn't attach to anything. So it doesn't matter. And this guy was like, what would be the
[0:41:41] SPEAKER_01: point of all of this? With this spitting anger for the record. But that's anyway, anyway.
[0:41:48] Unknown: Yeah, I'm nice, nice, nice, and story up a little bit. So, I think it's good to talk about what's
[0:41:57] SPEAKER_00: the point? What is the point? Like, what's the good news? And I don't know, you know, it's like,
[0:42:01] SPEAKER_00: y'all get to decide for yourself. To me, it's like the matrix, right? Like, do you want to take the
[0:42:05] SPEAKER_00: blue pill or the red pill? And, you know, seeing the truth is not always funny and happy, happy,
[0:42:10] Unknown: joy, joy, but it's true. Yeah, right. So good. Yeah. Yes. It is a real. I used to feel like I was
[0:42:20] Unknown: kind of empty or like faking something or I don't know, you know, to feel real. Like, and I don't
[0:42:27] SPEAKER_00: mean real, like I exist in this world of form. I mean, like, it's, it's like connected. It's like
[0:42:33] SPEAKER_00: true. And like feeling truth is powerful. It's very relieving to my system. And so,
[0:42:40] SPEAKER_00: you know, you all get to decide, but the truth of meditation, there are some traditions that I'm
[0:42:45] SPEAKER_00: sure are different, like Advaita Vedanta is very different. And in fact, it's very possible this
[0:42:51] Unknown: listener is practicing TM, because they noted doing it two times a day. And that's quite common
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_00: with TM. TM comes from the Advaita Vedanta tradition. And they do tend to that is a wake
[0:43:06] Unknown: up tradition. Yeah. So they're kind of moving towards accessing higher states of bliss and
[0:43:12] SPEAKER_00: consciousness. So I'm not very well versed in it. And I'm certainly not trying to say that that's
[0:43:18] SPEAKER_00: not true. I just think that from what I can understand from my experience, and from listening
[0:43:23] Unknown: to multiple deep teachers, it's not only that it's a whole, like we said before, semi sweet mixture
[0:43:34] SPEAKER_00: of experience that we can feel in this in this journey that we're all on. And there's not one
[0:43:41] SPEAKER_00: worth attaching to. We don't attach to the good thoughts versus the bad thoughts. We don't attach
[0:43:46] SPEAKER_00: to feelings over thoughts. We don't, we don't touch any of it. And that's what makes people
[0:43:50] SPEAKER_00: so equanimous. Right. You if you want to know equanimity, go watch Muji and go have a field day
[0:43:56] SPEAKER_00: with him. But he's certainly happy. And he's certainly equanimous. But he's definitely I
[0:44:02] SPEAKER_00: don't think he cares if he has a negative thought or a good thought or a good day or a bad day or
[0:44:07] Unknown: like he eats today or doesn't eat today. Yeah, energetically, he's a great person to just like
[0:44:13] SPEAKER_01: go watch his videos or listen to his talks, because it is just that like, no argument with reality.
[0:44:20] SPEAKER_01: He really is not arguing with reality. He's like, don't worry. Yeah.
[0:44:29] SPEAKER_00: But he would just say to you, like, just don't listen to the thought. Like, you know, you have
[0:44:34] SPEAKER_00: a thought, come back to the breath, you have a thought, come back to the breath, you have a
[0:44:37] SPEAKER_00: thought, that thought is nothing. That thought is a lie. Like he doesn't even follow them the
[0:44:42] SPEAKER_00: way some people do. But remember, all of these different methodologies are all just what do they
[0:44:47] SPEAKER_00: call it fingers pointing at the moon? Yeah. Right. They're all just pathways and everyone will walk
[0:44:52] SPEAKER_00: their own. But the moon is the truth. And the truth is you are free. And the truth is your whole and
[0:44:56] Unknown: the truth is your sacred and the truth is all of it is. And it's all connected. And so whatever way
[0:45:03] SPEAKER_00: you got to go to get there, get there. We just always seem to choose making space for it all to
[0:45:09] Unknown: exist and touching it as much as you can with love and with awareness. And then seeing what
[0:45:17] Unknown: moves from there. I can't think of a better way to complete this episode. Thank you.

[0:46:35] Unknown: honesty and unwavering vulnerability is like coming home again. The warmth, care and compassion
