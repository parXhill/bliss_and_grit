[0:00:00] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:12] SPEAKER_01: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about being
[0:00:18] Unknown: on the embodied spiritual path. What does that actually mean? What is a real evolution
[0:00:24] SPEAKER_01: of our lives? How do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the
[0:00:29] SPEAKER_01: joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life. If you're enjoying the show,
[0:00:35] SPEAKER_01: we'd be totally delighted if you left a review on iTunes or on our Facebook page,
[0:00:40] SPEAKER_01: which is Bliss and Grit. You can also head over to blissandgrit.com and subscribe to get our new
[0:00:46] SPEAKER_01: weekly digest of the resources we are currently loving. This week's episode is about exploring
[0:00:55] SPEAKER_01: the ways in which we can come to identify with ourselves as someone with problems. Acknowledging
[0:01:01] SPEAKER_01: aspects of ourselves that are unhealed or messy can often be painful, yet we still can have this
[0:01:09] SPEAKER_01: funny way of seeing and representing ourselves as the broken ones. In a recent retreat with teacher
[0:01:16] SPEAKER_01: John Prendergast, Brooke had a revelation that some of her patterning linked back to getting
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_01: rewarded earlier in life when she wasn't well. This understanding kicked off a beautiful
[0:01:28] SPEAKER_01: conversation for us where we explore safety, holding complexity, and the real habitual
[0:01:35] SPEAKER_01: tendency we can have to downplay ourselves and play small. One last thing that I want to bring
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_01: your attention to is next week we will not be recording for the Thanksgiving holiday,
[0:01:49] SPEAKER_01: so you won't get a new one in your inbox, but stay tuned to hear us the week after. Also,
[0:01:56] SPEAKER_01: of course, if you're new to the podcast, you may not realize that Brooke and I do have a tendency
[0:02:01] SPEAKER_01: to curse, so if you're in mixed company, you may want to pop some headphones in. Okay, y'all, here
[0:02:07] Unknown: we go. Hey, Vanessa. You shouldn't. I have the giggles. I was just thinking I have the giggles.
[0:02:18] SPEAKER_01: And then you started me off in a way that would make me giggle.
[0:02:25] SPEAKER_00: So we could clear that out. Yes, yes. We'll get the giggles out of the way. And I'm like about to
[0:02:29] SPEAKER_00: tell kind of a heavy story too, which is probably why I'm doing this, but you know, whatever. Or
[0:02:35] Unknown: it's not heavy. I don't know. See how it comes out. So here's the thing. So I just recently had a
[0:02:43] SPEAKER_00: weekend retreat with John Prendergast. And so first I want to say yes, that very good.
[0:02:55] Unknown: Him. Him. All of them. Definitely. He wrote a book called In Touch, which has been really
[0:03:03] SPEAKER_00: meaningful to me over the past year in particular. So it was great to be able to sit with him. And
[0:03:08] SPEAKER_00: he's a psychotherapist and also very much in the non-dual spiritual world and just combines them in
[0:03:14] Unknown: a lovely way. I mean, his main focus of his work is sort of what I care about the most, which is
[0:03:21] Unknown: how do we lose our internal compasses and then how do we reconnect to them? So quite lovely work.
[0:03:30] SPEAKER_00: And one of the exercises he had us do in dyads was to really drop in, meaning like embodied
[0:03:39] SPEAKER_00: meditation, which he guided us through, sitting across from a partner that we were working with.
[0:03:46] SPEAKER_00: And then in the partner work, what we were doing was working with a belief about ourselves,
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_00: because of course we have many, many, many beliefs about ourselves.
[0:03:53] SPEAKER_00: And the one that had come up for me in preparing for this exercise, which he also led us through,
[0:03:58] SPEAKER_00: was I'm really fucked up, was like what the space gave to me as like the exact phrasing of this
[0:04:05] SPEAKER_00: particular belief system I have about myself. So I was like, okay, that's interesting. That's a juicy
[0:04:09] SPEAKER_00: one. So we dropped into the space sitting across from my partner, which was my friend Christina,
[0:04:16] SPEAKER_00: who is the best and was the best at it. And then we were like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[0:04:22] SPEAKER_00: Hosting the retreat in case you're listening, Christina, your magic. And the question
[0:04:29] SPEAKER_00: that she would ask me as I'm sitting with this belief system is, what is your deepest knowing of
[0:04:34] SPEAKER_00: this? And then I would drop back in to myself and ask my heart space, because it's very easy for us
[0:04:41] SPEAKER_00: to ask our head space and it can spin off a million theories and it can kind of trace your
[0:04:46] SPEAKER_00: psychological trajectory for you all day long, but it doesn't really unhook. And we would keep
[0:04:52] SPEAKER_00: going back and forth whenever I would nod to her that I wanted her to ask me again so that I could
[0:04:57] SPEAKER_00: keep throwing, putting the bucket down the well, you know, and seeing what would come up. And what
[0:05:01] SPEAKER_00: was really cool about the way that he had us really deeply attune to ourselves first and then to one
[0:05:07] Unknown: another from within ourselves, much like Judith Blackstone does, was that you do get this instant
[0:05:16] SPEAKER_00: surprising bit of information. It's like this little lightning bolt, right? Or it's just like,
[0:05:23] SPEAKER_00: here you go. So when I first dropped down in what is your own deepest knowing of this belief system,
[0:05:31] Unknown: which was I'm really fucked up. And the first thing I saw was a family member of mine who I'm
[0:05:39] SPEAKER_00: actually not, like a distant family member of mine who I'm not close with, I don't have a
[0:05:44] SPEAKER_00: relationship with. I don't see particular, I don't see at all really, but the memory was of like a
[0:05:50] SPEAKER_00: decade ago when we were having this rare family gathering where I did see this person. And it was
[0:05:57] SPEAKER_00: just like playing a movie of a four second snippet of this gathering. And she, somebody had asked
[0:06:07] SPEAKER_00: something innocuous about what are you doing for work or I heard you guys are moving or small talk
[0:06:13] Unknown: stuff. And she went, I have a lot of problems, you know. How old was she about? Like what age group
[0:06:19] Unknown: are we talking? She's so. In that moment, I mean? In that moment, no, no, no. In that moment, she was
[0:06:27] SPEAKER_00: probably 30. And that's her way of being in the world. And as somebody who knows her as a family
[0:06:34] Unknown: member, I do that judgy thing where I don't care for that. And it's one of the reasons why we don't
[0:06:45] SPEAKER_00: have a relationship. So it was one of those moments in that moment where I did the internal
[0:06:50] SPEAKER_00: eye roll, right? Of like, mm hmm, yeah, no, no. You always believe you're the one with all the big
[0:06:55] SPEAKER_00: major problems, right? But what was cool was in this moment in my weekend with John Prendergast,
[0:07:01] SPEAKER_00: when I saw that, it was very clear that I was being shown that because that I have that piece.
[0:07:08] SPEAKER_00: It's one of many pieces in me. There's some part of me that feels that way too. This like, I have a
[0:07:17] SPEAKER_00: lot of problems, you know, so I was like, oh, interesting. It didn't give me any more information
[0:07:20] SPEAKER_00: than that. So then Christina asks me the question again, what is your own deepest knowing of this?
[0:07:25] SPEAKER_00: And so I dropped back down into my heart space. And I saw myself going to as a child, like 10,
[0:07:34] SPEAKER_00: 11 years old, going to the hospital to get tests because I grew up with seizure disorder. So it was
[0:07:38] SPEAKER_00: like sort of standard fare, like no high drama, but like time for an MRI or an EEG or whatever.
[0:07:45] SPEAKER_00: Not that I had to get them all the time, but it wasn't like some rush rush hospital scene. It was
[0:07:49] Unknown: like a part of my growing up. And I saw that my mom was being very
[0:07:58] Unknown: attentive, very loving, very motherly. And long story short, without going through each of the dives,
[0:08:05] SPEAKER_00: what I could see was like, and then instantly this affection for this part of my identity wells up
[0:08:12] SPEAKER_00: because it's like, oh, there is this piece that's holding on to I'm really fucked up because it was
[0:08:19] Unknown: this really clever, smart way to get love. Like if I'm going to the hospital for an EEG, I get a lot
[0:08:30] SPEAKER_00: of love and affection and mothering, which at that time, you know, for a chunk of my growing up,
[0:08:36] Unknown: not so much. I had to do a lot of adulting. So it was very sweet to see like, oh my gosh,
[0:08:45] SPEAKER_00: how smart of you, right? Like you got to be a kid who was mothered when you were quote, really fucked
[0:08:51] Unknown: up. Like you had to go to the hospital and get some tests. And so first I could have all this affection
[0:08:58] SPEAKER_00: for it. I could also see it and I could see how it's playing right now. I don't, and it's so cool
[0:09:05] SPEAKER_00: because I don't have any kind of at all, like high drama situation. It's just that there's this
[0:09:13] SPEAKER_00: part of me, like what we were talking about with Jeannie Zandi, where it's like, I don't know why
[0:09:16] SPEAKER_00: I feel the fear. And I think that that is a myriad of things. So I'm not trying to like pin it down
[0:09:20] Unknown: to this one thing, but there is this piece that's like, has formed identity around the one who has
[0:09:29] SPEAKER_00: a lot of problems. The one who's got it more fucked up than other people, which growing up was
[0:09:37] Unknown: about health. So so much sweetness for that and so much affection. I thought, isn't that interesting?
[0:09:45] SPEAKER_00: Like we recently did an episode a couple back where a lot of what we were talking about is how
[0:09:50] SPEAKER_00: much all of us in our culture wants to be the ones who have our shit together. We want to be able to
[0:09:56] SPEAKER_00: do that. And and that maybe we don't have to get our shit together. And I was like, and at the exact
[0:10:02] SPEAKER_00: same time, I also have this part of me that is attached to being the one who can't get her shit
[0:10:10] Unknown: together or who has a lot of problems, you know, like as who's kind of fucked up. How sweet to see
[0:10:18] Unknown: that layer too. So I wanted to talk a little bit about what happens when we in innocence,
[0:10:28] SPEAKER_00: such beloved innocence can sometimes get attached to being the one who can't get it together.
[0:10:35] SPEAKER_00: How does that serve us? And it's also connected to something you and I have for years long before
[0:10:43] SPEAKER_00: Bliss and Grit existed gone through together, we had a year where we were texting each other,
[0:10:49] SPEAKER_00: for those of you listening, we were texting each other the phrase own your seniority randomly
[0:10:53] SPEAKER_00: through the day here and there, because we were trying to remind each other that we,
[0:10:58] SPEAKER_00: we can step into our adulthood, we can step into our worthiness, and that we have things to share,
[0:11:04] Unknown: like on our career path and in the world. And it continues to be a thing,
[0:11:14] SPEAKER_00: something that we're working out together and individually. So that.
[0:11:22] Unknown: The identity is so funny, isn't it? Because there's nothing linear or rational about it
[0:11:34] SPEAKER_01: in the sense that, for example, you can find yourself to be not enough and too much.
[0:11:40] SPEAKER_01: And you can find yourself to be one who needs to have it all together and one who has nothing
[0:11:47] Unknown: together. And that these different aspects can exist all in the same moment.
[0:11:56] Unknown: I related to that story you just told to myself around being sick. I recognized a little bit back
[0:12:06] Unknown: in the weeks, months, whatever it was, that being sick is like a boundary for me.
[0:12:14] Unknown: You know, it's a great way to say no. You know, it's perhaps
[0:12:21] SPEAKER_01: a way to say no that I feel really safe with, you know, oh, I just literally can't do it.
[0:12:28] SPEAKER_01: You know, I can't do it. I wish can't stay in Miami, mom and dad, I'm sick. You know, there's,
[0:12:34] Unknown: there's this ability to set boundaries. And of course, when I was little, I seem to have come
[0:12:42] Unknown: into this world with just gobs of body karma. And I was sick all the time. And like what you
[0:12:49] Unknown: were describing, I certainly got loving kindness and attention. You know, for all I know, maybe the
[0:12:55] SPEAKER_01: chaos in my house like abated a little bit as they shifted into a different focus, you know,
[0:13:00] SPEAKER_01: the focus being their child being sick and not all of the other things that may typically catch
[0:13:06] Unknown: their attention between one another. And then and then there's this boundary, right? I don't
[0:13:12] SPEAKER_01: want to go to school. You don't have to you're sick. I want to lay in bed and watch TV like great,
[0:13:17] SPEAKER_01: you're sick. So I related to this sense of there's all these different places where they're almost
[0:13:27] SPEAKER_01: almost like a defensive movement, you know, like a self protective movement. They can become habits
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_01: and identities. That's certainly a one way to say it. But something I noticed in myself,
[0:13:41] SPEAKER_01: probably I've seen this for years is there can be a tendency where you want to show your soft belly,
[0:13:48] SPEAKER_01: like you reveal all your vulnerability to everybody so that they don't feel intimidated.
[0:13:55] SPEAKER_00: Do you know what I mean? I do. I think it's one of the reasons why this came up. Yeah. Yeah,
[0:14:00] SPEAKER_01: don't get too upset with me because you know, I have a lot of problems to like here they are,
[0:14:05] SPEAKER_01: right? And like, you don't need to feel intimidated. And you don't need to put me on a pedestal. And
[0:14:11] SPEAKER_01: you don't need to project on me because I'm just oh, so human. And I've got gobs of issues. And,
[0:14:18] Unknown: and the weird thing is culturally, there is a certain validation to this that the more I expose
[0:14:27] Unknown: how messed up I am, the less you're likely to attack me, the more you're likely to relate to me.
[0:14:35] Unknown: So I noticed that having grown up for whatever reason, and I don't know like the deeper reason
[0:14:43] SPEAKER_01: in my life why this was happening, but I grew up with a lot of people having problems with me.
[0:14:49] SPEAKER_01: Thinking I was too much. I was taking up too much space. I was too loud. I was too pretty. I was too
[0:14:52] SPEAKER_01: popular. I had too many guys I was hooking up with that were interested in me. I don't know,
[0:14:56] SPEAKER_01: just too much. I was clearly encroaching in something in some people's reality. And
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_01: it sounds like right, poor girl, right? Like what problems? And then what happens though is,
[0:15:12] SPEAKER_01: I was getting negative attention, right? I was having a lot of drama with people at school.
[0:15:17] SPEAKER_01: People were not liking me. People were, I had a lot of a kind of group violence isn't the word,
[0:15:24] Unknown: but like when a group all turns against you. So I got hip to the idea that when I talk about all
[0:15:33] Unknown: the ways that I'm fucked up, it helps. Right? It just seems to soften people. And it's like,
[0:15:40] SPEAKER_01: what? You know, I hate myself. Does that make you feel better? Like I am like grossly afraid of
[0:15:47] Unknown: people and you know, yeah, let me show you all my problems. Let me show you all my soft, squishy,
[0:15:55] SPEAKER_01: vulnerable problems. Right. And, and, and there's a real part of intimacy and connection that
[0:16:01] SPEAKER_01: involves that. So, you know, there's no categorical statement here. What becomes interesting,
[0:16:06] SPEAKER_01: I think what we're talking about is when that becomes a defensive movement or a habit or a
[0:16:11] SPEAKER_01: pattern that you almost become attached to in a way that it negates the rest of the truth,
[0:16:18] Unknown: which is, and I'm an expert in my field. I'm very talented. I also do believe in myself in other
[0:16:26] SPEAKER_01: ways. I also am quite blessed, right? It's like it, it, um, obscured the totality.
[0:16:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And you know, what's funny is I'm thinking about at the end of the retreat when we were,
[0:16:38] Unknown: you know, all complete and just leaving, I was talking with this, um, lovely woman and, uh,
[0:16:45] Unknown: first she was saying to me, um, that there was something about the way I was communicating,
[0:16:51] SPEAKER_00: like when I would speak in the group that she was like, wow, I want to know, um, what she sees and
[0:16:57] SPEAKER_00: what she's glimpsed and like, kind of this like, wow, she's really, um, you know, way down,
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_00: farther down the road and I want to know what she's figured out, like a little bit of admiration,
[0:17:09] SPEAKER_00: right? And, and then right after she finished saying it, and I think it's, it is so great
[0:17:14] SPEAKER_00: because it illustrates what we do all the time. She was like, cause I was there and I was, I was
[0:17:18] SPEAKER_00: with John Prendergast and so I was very much telling him like what's going on and, and asking
[0:17:24] SPEAKER_00: for help and working on that with the group. And she was like, but I was also like, come on,
[0:17:31] SPEAKER_00: at what point do people just like figure it out?
[0:17:36] SPEAKER_00: And I was standing with my friend Christina, who's also been on the path for quite a long time and
[0:17:40] SPEAKER_00: we were both cracking up. I was like, I know we all want to believe that there is the brass ring
[0:17:45] SPEAKER_00: and someone's going to get it, you know, and we, and we want the one person in the room or the
[0:17:50] SPEAKER_00: people in the room who've been on the path for a long time to go, it's, you know, look,
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_00: I've been on the path a long time and I'm all tidied up and I grabbed the brass ring and it's
[0:17:59] SPEAKER_00: awesome. So it's like at the same exact same time, those things happen. Can I be in the circle? Can
[0:18:06] SPEAKER_00: I be in the group and really bear, you know, what's going on for me? That's super vulnerable
[0:18:14] SPEAKER_00: and be somebody who is thought of as, you know, somebody with expertise. Cause there was one night
[0:18:22] SPEAKER_00: where John was going to maybe not be there because of actually like, whatever, I won't get into all
[0:18:27] SPEAKER_00: the stuff because of stuff that had gone on outside of the retreat group. And so there was
[0:18:36] SPEAKER_00: this chance that I was going to have to lead the night meditation. Christina had wanted me to run
[0:18:41] Unknown: it. And I was like, Oh, come on. You know, like I'm sitting in this circle all weekend, bearing my
[0:18:48] SPEAKER_00: soul. And now I'm going to sit up in front and be like, follow me dear ones. I'm the one that,
[0:18:54] SPEAKER_00: that now is going to guide you into meditation. You know, it's like, come on, how do we allow
[0:18:59] SPEAKER_00: ourselves to be both? And, you know, like if I had had to do that, that night, which I didn't,
[0:19:06] SPEAKER_00: because of the way it worked out, it would have been really interesting, right? Like here's the,
[0:19:11] SPEAKER_00: I'm really fucked up, soft, messy underbelly. And then also stepping into role, the role of teacher
[0:19:17] SPEAKER_00: in the place of somebody who I deeply admire, not because I was going to teach his material or
[0:19:23] Unknown: anything. I was going to do a guided meditation, but so funny to watch both of those things happen.
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_00: Same, same like, and yes, we can, we can step into roles of expertise and capacity and ability
[0:19:39] SPEAKER_00: and, and be messy humans, but we don't have a culture that values that those things co-exist
[0:19:45] SPEAKER_01: all the time in all of us. Sure. I mean, the discrepancy is only conceptual,
[0:19:50] Unknown: because the reality is they coexist. But it's so interesting how we can look at the concept and
[0:19:56] Unknown: think that's meant to be reality. So conceptually, we have this divide, you know, if I'm the one who's
[0:20:02] SPEAKER_01: falling apart, I can't be the one who has anything understood, right? That there are these two
[0:20:07] SPEAKER_01: different discrepant things. And yet they literally coexist with each other all of the time,
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_01: not only at the very same moment, but also in this ebbing and flowing kind of a way.
[0:20:19] Unknown: And there's this way that, you know, when you look at psychological defense, wow, it feels like
[0:20:27] Unknown: forever ago, you and I spoke about the fear that can arise around joy. And I was talking about this
[0:20:35] SPEAKER_01: school of psychology that's called psychosynthesis and how they talk about the repression of the
[0:20:40] SPEAKER_01: sublime. So normally we think about psychological defenses in terms of, I don't want to feel my
[0:20:47] SPEAKER_01: shame. I don't want to feel my fear. I don't want you to know how fucked up I am or how unlovable I
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_01: am. But there are also defenses towards these other aspects of self that could be considered
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_01: transcendent or divine or sacred or beautiful or powerful or special, intelligent, you know,
[0:21:10] Unknown: all of these different quote unquote beautiful aspects of self. And so really what we're looking
[0:21:17] Unknown: at, I guess, with identity, the funny thing is you have this idea of who you're supposed to be
[0:21:24] Unknown: to get by in this world, right? To get love, to be safe, to feel somewhat good. And you create a
[0:21:33] Unknown: whole structure around that. Like we would say in psychology, personality structure, but that's not
[0:21:40] SPEAKER_01: what I feel. I feel it's like you're shaping clay. Like Vanessa is going to be like this and I'm
[0:21:46] SPEAKER_01: starting to shape it. And I start to have this kind of like guidelines forming and they're like,
[0:21:52] SPEAKER_01: well, she has to have some confidence because otherwise she'll get bullied, but not too much.
[0:21:59] SPEAKER_01: Definitely show people how you're vulnerable and that'll work out and try to take on people's
[0:22:04] SPEAKER_01: feelings as much as you can. You can't be happy unless they're happy. And you start to
[0:22:08] Unknown: structure yourself, cellularly, somatically, and that orientation that becomes your orientation
[0:22:16] Unknown: towards life. Everything gets then filtered through this structure so that as you think,
[0:22:22] SPEAKER_01: as you decide, as you choose, as you feel, as you move, as you breathe, it's all getting
[0:22:27] Unknown: filtered through these structures. I'm the one with the problems. I'm not enough.
[0:22:35] SPEAKER_01: I'm the smart one. It doesn't even really matter. And in that you're always negating some other
[0:22:42] Unknown: aspect of self. Some of them could be, you know, these gorgeous ones that we only dream about
[0:22:49] SPEAKER_01: having. And some of them could be the ones that we feel afraid and want to keep in the closet,
[0:22:53] SPEAKER_01: but either way, it's not reality. It's just a division of your wholeness.
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_00: I think one of the things that can happen whenever we start really examining just how many
[0:23:06] SPEAKER_00: belief systems we have about who we are, all the identities we've crafted, is that it can feel like
[0:23:16] Unknown: it ends in the slow blinker place. Like, so do we remove it all and remove it all and remove it all
[0:23:22] SPEAKER_00: until we're just wide open space and we just give people that kind of gauzy spiritual gaze
[0:23:27] SPEAKER_00: and slow blink and we don't have emotions? Like these are the ideas that the mind or the separate
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_00: self has about what it means to not hold our beliefs about who we are so tightly. And in this
[0:23:41] SPEAKER_00: weekend, at the very end, it was really helpful because John was actually speaking to this directly
[0:23:47] Unknown: and he said, you know, I'm in a role right now of teacher. He's like, not meaning I'm faking
[0:23:56] Unknown: something, but like, that's what I'm here to do is to be teacher. And it serves. And so for as long
[0:24:05] SPEAKER_00: as that role is needed, meaning we're gathered here for all of the myriad of reasons that came
[0:24:12] Unknown: together for that to happen, that role serves and that's what's coming through this one. Like that
[0:24:21] SPEAKER_00: would be a healthy role that you're playing. And then when it's not needed anymore, I don't
[0:24:26] Unknown: walk around all the time, you know, playing teacher. Like it doesn't make sense, for example,
[0:24:35] SPEAKER_00: if this was about me and the role of teacher to be like at Thanksgiving dinner playing teacher,
[0:24:39] SPEAKER_00: right? Like I'm going to impart some wisdom to my family across the Thanksgiving table.
[0:24:46] SPEAKER_00: No, that doesn't make any sense. Then your daughter and sibling and mother and all of the other
[0:24:53] SPEAKER_00: things and those roles serve in that environment. It works. It's how we relate. And that was just so
[0:25:02] SPEAKER_00: helpful for me. It's so simple, but we do have to remind ourselves when separate self gets a little
[0:25:06] SPEAKER_00: skittish, like, well, I don't want to be one of those annoying slow blink people. It's like, no,
[0:25:10] SPEAKER_00: no, no, we still play roles that serve in the world, not play role meaning make believe or put
[0:25:18] SPEAKER_00: on an act. But like we behave in the world in the ways that come through us, because we're all unique
[0:25:26] SPEAKER_00: human beings and we all have gifts and capacities and desires and creativity. And so it serves,
[0:25:33] SPEAKER_00: like in the right moments and in a different time. So I just want to add that too, because sometimes
[0:25:38] SPEAKER_00: it can feel like falling through space. And it's like, no, thank you, because I don't want to land
[0:25:41] Unknown: in that place of, of no identities, where I'm just one of those transcendent assholes who doesn't
[0:25:51] Unknown: know how to be a human being anymore. Sure. But that is the interesting thing. I've heard the
[0:25:58] SPEAKER_01: metaphor before that, if you look at the ocean, for example, right, we know this metaphor, we're
[0:26:04] SPEAKER_01: all one, the ocean is all one, and yet it has waves, and each wave is distinct, and it's separate.
[0:26:10] SPEAKER_01: And Adi Ashanti talks a ton about spiritual autonomy and being separate and having
[0:26:17] SPEAKER_01: a uniqueness to you that everybody does. And we actually have had the privilege of knowing a lot
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_01: of different teachers and their personalities are also distinct, so distinct, also different.
[0:26:29] Unknown: Yeah. Right. Certainly not slow blinkerish. But it is a funny thing, you know, I guess as you were
[0:26:35] SPEAKER_01: talking for some reason, you didn't even say anything like this, but something in your intro
[0:26:40] Unknown: made me think you were going to say something like this. I was thinking about how society can
[0:26:46] SPEAKER_01: kind of punish you either way. Like if you feel too good about yourself, some people love that.
[0:26:53] SPEAKER_01: Some people love it when you feel good about yourself, you'll get followers, you'll get
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_01: admirers, like that's just the kind of faith and confidence they need and they want in their lives.
[0:27:02] SPEAKER_01: And some people love it. And some people hate it. They'll tear you down. Who do you think you are?
[0:27:07] SPEAKER_01: Right. So there's certainly punishment that can come societally if you're too big. But if you're
[0:27:13] Unknown: too little and you don't think anything of yourself, you know, you can get kicked around. Right. So I
[0:27:19] Unknown: was thinking, oh, that's so interesting. My first thought was like, it's interesting. There's almost
[0:27:23] Unknown: no way you can win. It's like, like when Kieran did her interview, Kieran Trace on Buddha at the
[0:27:30] SPEAKER_01: gas pump, which is the first time we heard her was on that podcast. I remember having friends being
[0:27:35] Unknown: like, uh-uh, she's too egoic because she thinks well of herself. And I'm like, well, that's an
[0:27:41] SPEAKER_01: interesting thing. Is it really a problem to think well of yourself? And is that what egoic even means?
[0:27:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And is that very interesting? And this is, that was kind of a sidebar to what I was going to
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_01: say, but let's hold that one. But what I meant to say was, I think really the problem is most of us
[0:27:58] SPEAKER_01: are taught to orient outwards. So if I'm going to worry about whether or not I will be punished or
[0:28:05] Unknown: praised, I already have a dilemma on my hands because I already start to shape my movement
[0:28:12] SPEAKER_01: a certain way. I already start to concretize something rather than be in a spontaneous flow
[0:28:18] SPEAKER_01: where I'm not the boss. Right. And I start to be as if either to try to get the praise, avoid the
[0:28:23] SPEAKER_01: punishment, get the punishment, cause that's what I'm used to. Like it doesn't matter, but either way
[0:28:28] Unknown: I start to shape my movement and something that I think strategically will evoke a response. But as
[0:28:35] SPEAKER_01: we know about the external world, there's no consistent way to do that. Cause if you praise
[0:28:40] SPEAKER_01: yourself, you can get admonished. And if you make yourself small, there could be other difficulties
[0:28:45] SPEAKER_01: in our society. So that's interesting. I think part of the journey is just about self-orientation,
[0:28:52] SPEAKER_01: just trusting who you are and being in self possession and letting that unfold. Like even
[0:28:58] SPEAKER_01: if you were afraid of being a slow blinker, it's like, well, why don't you just see if that's what
[0:29:03] SPEAKER_00: happens? Exactly. Go see like cross the road, see if that's what it looks like over there.
[0:29:08] SPEAKER_01: Why would we expect that? Right. So there's that piece. And then I think this is an interesting
[0:29:12] SPEAKER_01: question. You know, when you feel good about yourself in mainstream culture, that can be
[0:29:18] SPEAKER_01: pretty well applaud that we do love someone who is confident, but in highly sensitive circles,
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_01: that's different. We start to like humility, you know, we're like,
[0:29:32] SPEAKER_01: you're not so spiritual if you're tooting your own horn. Like there's nothing so spiritual about
[0:29:38] Unknown: someone who's proclaiming themselves. So that is interesting territory, because those are the
[0:29:45] SPEAKER_01: circles that we are in because of who we are and how we move in the world. Yeah. And you know,
[0:29:52] Unknown: I keep finding as we do this work together, it has the benefit for us for me of being this
[0:30:02] SPEAKER_00: really wonderful self exploration that happens in public and it is this unfolding, right, where
[0:30:12] SPEAKER_00: it's like, I can see myself wanting to be the humble, likeable one. Not that I'm like making
[0:30:21] SPEAKER_00: that shit up and like putting on a show, but I can see when that starts to wrap itself into an identity,
[0:30:30] SPEAKER_00: because I understand, like you said, like, it's very easy to get hip to the game, like this is
[0:30:34] Unknown: likable, right, people aren't going to attack me so much. And to just always be be the one who's
[0:30:41] Unknown: learning in public is a very safe place to be. You know, and it's one of the reasons why I've
[0:30:47] Unknown: stepped into this out of liberated body. You know, nothing that we do publicly is totally safe. But
[0:30:53] SPEAKER_00: in liberated body, I was a container for other people's ideas, which was great. I don't think
[0:30:57] SPEAKER_00: there's anything wrong with that. I learned a ton from learning how to hold space for other people,
[0:31:02] SPEAKER_00: and I learned a ton from those people. But wow, if you're somebody who has hiding stuff, which I do,
[0:31:10] SPEAKER_00: and I have pretty significant hiding stuff, not in the sense that like I have some really intense
[0:31:15] SPEAKER_00: story about going deep underground, but my reasons for why I got wired that way are
[0:31:21] Unknown: stronger than the average bears, let's say. And so then I can come into this and it's like, okay,
[0:31:30] SPEAKER_00: but I'm still just a person in process. And that's going to be true forever. You know,
[0:31:35] SPEAKER_00: for as long as I have the great grace to continue to be Brooke Thomas alive in this body, I will
[0:31:42] SPEAKER_00: always be a person in process because as long as we're in a human body, we're having a human experience.
[0:31:46] Unknown: And like, you know, I've been in the cinematic field for 20 years. I've had some pretty big
[0:31:56] SPEAKER_00: personal, you know, realizations and then integrations of those realizations. I have a lot
[0:32:01] SPEAKER_00: to offer people and we have a lot to offer people and we do. So it's this funny watching, like when
[0:32:09] SPEAKER_00: does it become a hiding? When does it become a safe place to hide out in to be the one who's
[0:32:18] Unknown: just in process, folks, you know, and then we get to catch that and like step into it a little more.
[0:32:24] SPEAKER_00: I had someone remind me recently of Rick Archie, who runs Spooda at the gas pump. You know how he
[0:32:29] SPEAKER_00: picks certain analogies and then just repeats them constantly?
[0:32:32] Unknown: Yeah, yeah. He loves that. He knows it and he can't stop it.
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_00: He's like, here's my, I know he knows it and he's like, I'm like, I've heard this a million times.
[0:32:40] SPEAKER_00: One of the ones that he brings up, which is a very good point, is that this path, you know,
[0:32:46] Unknown: being on an unfolding spiritual path is not that it's most akin to riding a bicycle. You know,
[0:32:53] Unknown: you don't ride a bike terrified and vigilant that you're doing it wrong or you might crash
[0:33:00] SPEAKER_00: or be careful and you don't just close your eyes and take your hands off the handlebars and go,
[0:33:07] SPEAKER_00: God, we'll steer my bike the right way. You know, I'm adding my own shit to this, but
[0:33:12] Unknown: you're constantly micro orienting on the bike so that you balance and so that it goes forward and
[0:33:20] SPEAKER_00: so that you steer and so that you're paying attention to your environment. But it's that
[0:33:24] SPEAKER_00: kind of little micro micro balancing, micro course correcting so that you stay on course.
[0:33:32] SPEAKER_00: And that's what we have the great benefit to do is to do these micro course corrections like,
[0:33:36] SPEAKER_00: okay, I see how I could easily become the one who's having the terror experience. And so,
[0:33:47] SPEAKER_00: right, like there's a bunch of different things that could go with that. And so,
[0:33:50] SPEAKER_00: wow, I'm really having a profound awakening or and so don't call me out on my nervous giggle
[0:33:59] SPEAKER_00: and how I hide behind it or whatever you want to as I do it to demonstrate or whatever it is you
[0:34:04] Unknown: want to call me out on. And I can just in every call always be the like, oh, don't you guys really
[0:34:12] SPEAKER_00: feel for me and like, oh, God, I have so much humility. I would never be the kind of person to
[0:34:18] SPEAKER_00: step in the spotlight those people, the worst and it's like, you know what,
[0:34:24] SPEAKER_00: we have some things to offer too. So it's fun to see all the micro correction.
[0:34:29] SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to claim I know so you can't say I'm wrong.
[0:34:32] SPEAKER_01: Right, right. God forbid.
[0:34:34] SPEAKER_01: Right. Because it doesn't feel safe. I mean,
[0:34:39] SPEAKER_01: I recognized meditating the other day as actually doing Jeannie Zandi's benevolent thief meditation.
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_01: And I'm in my body in this very profound way and with the moment in this very profound way.
[0:34:52] SPEAKER_01: And I realized, oh my gosh, like my body doesn't even really know how to rest completely.
[0:34:58] SPEAKER_01: And I mean that on a very relative spectrum, probably way more than other people's bodies.
[0:35:04] Unknown: But I'm talking like, wow, it's profound to find that essential rest, where we feel safe,
[0:35:14] SPEAKER_01: truly, like truly as yourself, like surrendering all of the machinations and strategies and ways
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_01: of being and thoughts about the future and then just feeling really at ease in that. So
[0:35:29] SPEAKER_01: once I recognize that these kinds of understandings just put into perspective, why it can be so tricky
[0:35:37] Unknown: for us. You know, in one way, what we're talking about is complexity. Right. We've used the word
[0:35:45] SPEAKER_01: paradox. And that's a very common thing that'll show up in conversations on spiritual maturity.
[0:35:50] Unknown: But we're also talking about complexity, like I'm complex. I am divine, I am God, and I am
[0:35:59] SPEAKER_01: purely human. And I am form and I am formless. And I have aspects of myself that at moments
[0:36:05] SPEAKER_01: can feel completely unworthy. And I have other aspects that know I am love, and I am loved.
[0:36:13] SPEAKER_01: All of it. And that's complexity, right? We're organisms with complexity. And that's
[0:36:19] SPEAKER_01: beyond that, because there is no separate I, and I mean this in a really like, scientific way.
[0:36:26] SPEAKER_01: There's no separate I from the earth and the elements and from brook. Right. So talk about
[0:36:29] Unknown: complex. Yet, the mind's desire, the ego strategies desire is to simplify.
[0:36:39] SPEAKER_01: So it's so interesting, because it's almost like, you know, I've noticed this in clients now that
[0:36:43] SPEAKER_01: I'm talking out loud. So maybe you come in and you haven't explored all of your conditioning and all
[0:36:49] Unknown: of your past that's living in your in your soma. And once you start, once you open it up, you're
[0:36:57] SPEAKER_01: like, Holy shit, I'm fucked up, right? Like, I have a lot of problems, you have this kind of
[0:37:02] SPEAKER_01: dawning realization, like, Oh, my God, I've been really hurt. And that's having a very clear effect
[0:37:09] SPEAKER_01: on my current day life. And in that realization, it's a very easy, slippery slope to now identifying
[0:37:18] SPEAKER_01: as that simplifying it. So now I'm the one who has all of the issues. And I'm the one who is healing.
[0:37:25] SPEAKER_01: And I'm doing the work. And I'm the one who was traumatized. And that was sad. Therefore,
[0:37:30] SPEAKER_01: my life is sad. And I am stuck in sad. And we just keep simplifying the same way as culturally,
[0:37:37] SPEAKER_01: we have people who simplify to like, it's just about your mind, positive thinking, right?
[0:37:44] SPEAKER_01: You know, as if it's if I wish it was so simple, that'd be so gorgeous. Right. But there's this
[0:37:51] SPEAKER_01: urge to simplify all the time. And I think part of that beautiful bike analogy about
[0:37:56] SPEAKER_01: micro movements is, we can even notice within ourselves the tendencies to want to simplify it.
[0:38:02] Unknown: So either we are experts. And then, right, because we always have been the logical thing,
[0:38:09] SPEAKER_01: you were talking about the next thing that follows. So either we are experts, and then then we can
[0:38:13] SPEAKER_01: teach, then we can brand ourselves that way, then we get to be confident and have answers and share
[0:38:19] Unknown: them with people. Or we're human beings in process, you know, exploring the ways in which
[0:38:26] Unknown: we're still constricted and restricted. And then, who are we to tell anyone what to do? And who are
[0:38:33] Unknown: we to feel really good about ourselves? And who are we to claim status, own our seniority? And it's
[0:38:40] SPEAKER_01: so interesting that that's happening. Because as I said before, that's all just a conceptual divide.
[0:38:46] SPEAKER_01: Because I don't know if I took you just said you you've been doing ralphing for 20 years.
[0:38:52] Unknown: So I've been doing acupuncture and psychology for same 20 years. And I realized, like, I've sat with
[0:39:00] Unknown: people who are suffering in some way, shape or form, over 7500 hours, that is like a very, very,
[0:39:09] SPEAKER_01: like minimum amount of hours, 7500 hours, no wonder I'm good at what I do a lot of hours.
[0:39:17] SPEAKER_01: Right? Like you get good at things after 7500 hours. So that is happening. And I am good at
[0:39:23] SPEAKER_01: what I do. And I'm a human being who's dealing with constrictions and restrictions. And once
[0:39:30] SPEAKER_01: every other week, still gets on the phone with Karen Trace to talk about the edge that's next
[0:39:35] Unknown: evolving for me. Yeah. And wouldn't it be great if there were more people and a toot our own horns
[0:39:43] SPEAKER_00: here, who were were in the public, you know, had public facing work of any kind, and could step
[0:39:52] SPEAKER_00: into their voice and their wisdom and their leadership role and at the exact same time, be
[0:39:59] SPEAKER_00: human beings who are in process, because as long as we're alive, we're in process. And there are a
[0:40:03] Unknown: lot of people who are doing that, which is great. And I would just like to make a plug for more of
[0:40:10] SPEAKER_00: that, you know, we can disrupt this cultural tendency to put people in one box or the other.
[0:40:16] SPEAKER_00: By having more people doing that. So all of you listening, you know, I know a lot of people who
[0:40:20] SPEAKER_00: listen also have their work, whether it's in private practice, or they write, or they teach,
[0:40:26] Unknown: or they run their own podcasts, or whatever. It's like, we can change things quite a lot by
[0:40:33] SPEAKER_00: holding both, you know, and, and living both and showing as examples. And, you know, the people I
[0:40:40] SPEAKER_00: think who have done that really have moved people. You know, like, I think it's one of the reasons
[0:40:46] SPEAKER_00: why Brene Brown is so successful. It's like, wow, she's so good at I mean, of course, her work is
[0:40:51] SPEAKER_00: about vulnerability. But she's so good at like owning her seniority and also being a human being.
[0:40:57] Unknown: It's, it's so helpful to to witness that it's so relieving, because it stops the separate self from
[0:41:05] Unknown: trying to shove itself in one box or another. Yeah, it is profoundly relieving. Those were exactly
[0:41:11] Unknown: the words I was thinking too, because there's an invitation for you to exist. I mean, I remember
[0:41:19] Unknown: one of our first life coaches Brooke and I worked with the same life coach when we were in our 20s.
[0:41:27] SPEAKER_01: And I remember talking to Barbara, as our life coach's wife, I switched over to the feminine one
[0:41:32] Unknown: after a while, we the her husband was my first life coach. And I remember talking to her, and I
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_01: just looked up to this woman, I still do. I think she's an incredible woman. And I must have been
[0:41:46] SPEAKER_01: maybe 2930 like that. So I was younger and still very hard on myself still thinking
[0:41:54] SPEAKER_01: that there was this kind of enlightened state, oh, please, oh, please, that I could reach where
[0:41:58] SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't have any feelings, and I definitely wouldn't have needs, and I certainly wouldn't
[0:42:01] SPEAKER_01: be messy. And so imagine that as your measuring stick for if you're, you know, succeeding as a
[0:42:08] SPEAKER_01: human on this planet. And I remember Barbara telling me something I can't even remember now
[0:42:13] SPEAKER_01: what she what she said, I even think it might have been as simple as telling me that she gets stage
[0:42:18] Unknown: fright every time she public speaks, you know, and we kind of opened this conversation about
[0:42:25] SPEAKER_01: she was much older than me, she was probably in her 50s. And we kind of opened this conversation
[0:42:30] SPEAKER_01: about how you always feel some measure of fear and insecurity and how these things don't go away.
[0:42:35] Unknown: And that was tremendous for me. It's it's it's almost hard to imagine how helpful it was.
[0:42:49] Unknown: But talk about deep exhale. Like, oh, so even people I admire can feel these things. So maybe
[0:42:58] SPEAKER_01: I'm not such a problem. Maybe the way that I think and the way that I feel and what I go through is
[0:43:04] SPEAKER_01: not such a problem. And and yet she remains someone who I deeply admired. You know, she was
[0:43:10] Unknown: an expert. She never felt the need to put herself down to make anyone feel better, you know. And I
[0:43:18] Unknown: felt the same way, funnily enough, to a much lesser degree. But I think it was recently Kieran wrote a
[0:43:25] Unknown: blog post and was talking about a problem she was struggling with. And I was like, ah, felt so good
[0:43:33] SPEAKER_01: because Kieran's in the awakened category. So now I see like, OK, there's not this hierarchy where
[0:43:40] SPEAKER_01: just because you deal with human experiences and you find edges and nooks and crannies and your
[0:43:47] Unknown: being that that makes you somehow lagging behind in this weird linear scale that my brain keeps
[0:43:57] SPEAKER_01: trying to sketch out out of a desire for simplicity. So it's tremendously relieving.
[0:44:03] SPEAKER_01: And I think that just some of what we come up against, I think we can't leave this behind,
[0:44:08] Unknown: or maybe I can't state it enough is we don't feel safe owning ourselves sometimes.
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And it's a beautiful journey to undertake without chucking large parts of your unfolding
[0:44:26] SPEAKER_00: human self in the garbage, you know, and splitting off being the together one. So to
[0:44:33] Unknown: undertake that journey in a really genuine and sincere way is just so sweet. Yeah, actually,
[0:44:41] Unknown: I'm thinking about it now. We had a listener write to us on Instagram and she said something like
[0:44:50] SPEAKER_01: she's thinking of coming out and I think writing and teaching more. She was already doing
[0:44:55] SPEAKER_01: something. She has some kind of a platform, but she was actually thinking of stepping out
[0:44:59] Unknown: in this larger way. And she was like, and I'm really scared. And I wondered if you had any
[0:45:04] Unknown: advice about it. And like, so interesting, because, you know, annoyingly, probably to some people,
[0:45:13] SPEAKER_01: my answers have gotten really untool oriented. I have no simple answers anymore. I'm like,
[0:45:22] SPEAKER_01: just recognize we're all afraid, you know, recognize these things arise, right, the basics,
[0:45:27] Unknown: but mostly I'm like, yeah, it's, it's about confronting within yourself, these aspects
[0:45:35] Unknown: that have come to be afraid of existing. Because, you know, it's not about me pretending to be an
[0:45:42] SPEAKER_01: expert and putting on the role the way you were like, trying to express through this nuance. It's
[0:45:47] Unknown: not about play acting. It's really about you being who you are. So if you're good at something,
[0:45:53] SPEAKER_01: you're just good at something. And then you know, you're good at something and it's just you being.
[0:45:57] SPEAKER_01: And if you're going to speak or teach or move or breathe or be gorgeous or whatever the case may
[0:46:04] SPEAKER_01: be, make beautiful art, you're going to do that because that's what you're going to do. That's
[0:46:08] SPEAKER_01: your spontaneous unfolding, right? So to me, I'm like, wow, it really somehow comes down to
[0:46:15] Unknown: feeling safe to exist. And some of that work we did with Judith, that was where I really started
[0:46:22] Unknown: to get a subtle sense of this. So on the one hand, how scary it was to land in different parts of my
[0:46:31] Unknown: body and be seen there. And then on the other hand, how profoundly safe and beautiful and
[0:46:42] Unknown: wholesome and yummy it felt when I did. Like that, that's where real safety was.
[0:46:50] Unknown: But it's such a subtle exploration. And if we can just have that in mind, and then along with that,
[0:46:59] SPEAKER_01: some kindness and understanding about why we may feel constricted about owning our seniority and
[0:47:06] SPEAKER_01: really coming out of the closet in our fullest, we can start to understand, well, the way that we
[0:47:11] Unknown: structured ourselves and why we structured like that, and then bring some love to that as we
[0:47:19] SPEAKER_01: slowly and beautifully learn to inhabit ourselves.
[0:47:23] SPEAKER_00: I cannot think of a better way to end the episode. Amen to that.
[0:47:27] Unknown: We're so happy you decided to listen to today's show. The show notes, including all of the
[0:47:37] SPEAKER_01: resources that we mentioned in this episode, live at bliss and grit.com. So if you go over to the
[0:47:44] SPEAKER_01: website and scroll down, you'll see each episode separate post, and we put resources like the
[0:47:49] SPEAKER_01: teachers we named or the books we talked about right in there. You can also come play with us
[0:47:55] SPEAKER_01: on Instagram and on Facebook. We're having some lively conversations over there we'd love you to
[0:48:00] SPEAKER_01: be a part of. We're bliss and grit at both of those spots. As I said in the intro, you can
[0:48:06] SPEAKER_01: subscribe on the website, bliss and grit.com. If you want to be first notified of any events we have
[0:48:12] SPEAKER_01: coming up for the community and to get our weekly newsletter that is chock full of the things that
[0:48:18] Unknown: we're loving at this given time. If you're loving the show and you want to support us,
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_01: well, we appreciate it if you'd go over and write us a review on iTunes, Stitcher, or on our Facebook
[0:48:31] SPEAKER_01: page. And certainly if technology isn't your thing and you are enjoying the show, telling your friends
[0:48:36] SPEAKER_01: is equally spectacular. This all helps us have people find the show and it also helps us have a
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_01: great community that's lively and engaged. A huge bit of gratitude to all of you who've already
[0:48:50] SPEAKER_01: taken the time to write reviews. We are so appreciative. Don't forget we are not recording
[0:48:55] SPEAKER_01: a new episode next week since next week is the Thanksgiving holiday. So we'll be back at it and
[0:49:02] SPEAKER_01: in your inboxes in two weeks. Okay. Thanks everyone.
