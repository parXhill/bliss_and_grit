[0:00:24] Unknown: Hello, beautifuls! You are listening to Bliss and Grit. I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined
[0:00:35] SPEAKER_01: soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas. On the show, we're talking about being on the
[0:00:42] SPEAKER_01: embodied spiritual path. What does that actually mean? What is a real evolution of our lives? How
[0:00:49] SPEAKER_01: do we ultimately embrace everything? All the beauty and crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss
[0:00:55] Unknown: and the grit that is a human life. In today's episode, we're speaking about what we're calling
[0:01:02] SPEAKER_01: micro-shaming, which could be described as the subtle ways we can inadvertently shame people for
[0:01:10] SPEAKER_01: being different than us. If you've been listening to us for a while, you know that exploring and
[0:01:15] SPEAKER_01: dismantling shame is dear to our hearts. In this conversation, we cover a broad expanse of topics
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_01: such as sick shaming, shaming others for their emotions, beliefs, or relationships, as well as
[0:01:30] SPEAKER_01: how shame can show up in our medical and wellness industries. This topic felt especially relevant in
[0:01:37] SPEAKER_01: this day and age where we have so many quote unquote gurus out there giving well intention,
[0:01:43] SPEAKER_01: but sometimes unhelpful advice that may be creating patterns of shame in us without us even
[0:01:51] SPEAKER_01: noticing. If you're enjoying the show, we would be totally delighted if you left a review on iTunes
[0:01:59] SPEAKER_01: or on our Facebook page, which is Bliss and Grit. You can also head over to blissandgrit.com and

[0:02:14] Unknown: One last thing before we head into conversation. Brooke and I have been known to curse, so if
[0:02:21] SPEAKER_01: you're in mixed company, you may want to wear headphones. Okay, here we go.
[0:02:31] Unknown: Hi Brooke. Hello, beautiful. I think we have a dilemma today because I can feel that I have
[0:02:38] SPEAKER_00: the giggles. We're feisty too. It's like giggly, I'll speak for myself, giggly, angry.
[0:02:46] SPEAKER_01: So, promises to be a fun episode. I know. Probably there's just been too much emotion
[0:02:52] SPEAKER_01: and energy stirring and it's nice to be talking to you and letting some of this like pent up
[0:02:57] SPEAKER_01: energy out. So, I'm trying to breathe and we'll see what happens. We apologize in advance for
[0:03:04] SPEAKER_00: what is likely to be a very swear heavy episode and probably will offend everyone.
[0:03:14] SPEAKER_01: Possibly. Maybe. Possibly. And our topic is micro shaming, so let's hope we just don't commit that.
[0:03:23] SPEAKER_01: So, also pardon that my brain is not very articulate. So, this is bound to be one of
[0:03:28] Unknown: your favorite episodes yet, dear listeners. Okay, so I wanted to start by reading a little meme
[0:03:37] Unknown: I shared on my Instagram a little while back because it's just a quick way of summing up
[0:03:43] SPEAKER_01: something that's been on my mind that's been showing up in my life. Okay, so the meme is by
[0:03:49] SPEAKER_01: unknown person. So, let's just pretend Vanessa Scott said that. Sure.
[0:03:54] SPEAKER_01: Okay, the first thing you should know about me is that I am not you. A lot more will make sense
[0:04:01] Unknown: after that. First thing you should know about me is that I am not you. A lot more will make sense
[0:04:08] Unknown: after that. So, this is I think it's fair to say perpetually on my mind. I wouldn't be surprised
[0:04:20] Unknown: if part of my life purpose is to bring more love, self-love, other love, love of life,
[0:04:30] SPEAKER_01: and hand in hand with that is tackling and exploring and researching the issue of shame.
[0:04:37] Unknown: So, this comes up for me all of the time, this exploration, and there's something that I've
[0:04:45] SPEAKER_01: noticed arises in my life between people, which is sort of this idea that everybody should be the
[0:04:53] SPEAKER_01: same, like everybody operates the same, everyone has the same path to healing, everyone has the
[0:05:00] Unknown: same needs, that something that works for me should by definition work for you. And part of what I
[0:05:10] Unknown: notice is it makes a troop of helper figures and I'm putting air quotes,
[0:05:22] SPEAKER_01: people who want to go around helping others with their very good advice.
[0:05:29] SPEAKER_01: And while the intention of this can be extremely benevolent, even extremely generous,
[0:05:36] SPEAKER_01: because often it's arising from our own identification, our own kind of contracted
[0:05:43] SPEAKER_01: or stuck places or our own personas, or just our own lack of understanding of the uniqueness
[0:05:50] Unknown: of the waves of human life, it can come out and be received by another person as a little micro
[0:05:59] Unknown: trauma that creates shame. Because, you know, simply put, if I was to walk around in the world
[0:06:06] SPEAKER_01: and think that everyone should think like Vanessa, act like Vanessa, do like Vanessa,
[0:06:11] SPEAKER_01: heal like Vanessa, and I was to be saying that on a pulpit, given that only some percentage will ever
[0:06:19] Unknown: relate to my experience of life, the percentage that doesn't can begin to feel problematic.
[0:06:30] Unknown: Abnormal, like they're not doing it right. Like what's their fucking problem? If only they could
[0:06:36] SPEAKER_01: just do what Vanessa said, it would all work. And in today's day and age, where so many people
[0:06:41] SPEAKER_01: out on social media or writing books or blogs or in documentaries, our gurus were in like the age
[0:06:49] SPEAKER_01: of the guru teacher, the here's the path, just follow this and you'll get there, no problem.
[0:06:55] SPEAKER_01: I think it's becoming increasingly problematic. And I thought they're useful to talk about.
[0:07:01] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, realizing that we didn't talk about this beforehand, when we were kind of riffing on what
[0:07:06] Unknown: we might talk about. But this is a conversation that's like very passionate to both of our hearts,
[0:07:13] Unknown: which is like this, what you're describing can only stem from objectification, objectification
[0:07:22] SPEAKER_00: of the self and of others. And this is, I would say for sure, and I'm thinking about this a lot,
[0:07:29] SPEAKER_00: a calling for me in my life, that we need to understand how much we make ourselves and others
[0:07:35] SPEAKER_00: objects and how harmful that is. That we have a whole culture that just takes that to be the norm.
[0:07:43] SPEAKER_00: And so in an example like that, the way you would make yourself the object, first of all, is you have
[0:07:48] Unknown: to assume, if you're like, if you first assume, if I assumed everyone thinks, acts, feels, and would
[0:07:55] SPEAKER_00: benefit in the way that Brooke does, in the way that I do. I've already made myself into an object
[0:08:01] SPEAKER_00: that is under my own conscious mental control, right? Like if I put the right foods in and the
[0:08:07] SPEAKER_00: right movements in and the right activities at work in, then my life will unfold in the way I've
[0:08:14] SPEAKER_01: decided it will unfold. Right, which is just sort of a conceptual layering, right? You're just
[0:08:20] SPEAKER_01: getting a concept onto the state of control. Yeah, and it's just, it's already crazy because
[0:08:26] SPEAKER_00: if we look in any of our lives, we know that a bajillion times we had a plan, life had different
[0:08:30] SPEAKER_00: plans. You know, that's just a part of the human condition. But when we think that we are an object,
[0:08:35] SPEAKER_00: which a great many of us got that messaging in our families of origin, I for sure was raised as an
[0:08:41] SPEAKER_00: object, even though my parents are lovely humans who loved and do love me very deeply, that was
[0:08:47] SPEAKER_00: just what they knew how to do, was human beings are objects. And so if I put the right ingredients in
[0:08:52] SPEAKER_00: you, you turn out to be this kind of human, right? Like you're not, you don't have your own agency
[0:08:58] SPEAKER_00: in your own life. Your life doesn't belong to you. Your life is the object that I need to shape,
[0:09:04] SPEAKER_00: you know, in a certain direction. So first of all, we assume that we are the object. And then we
[0:09:08] SPEAKER_00: assume that like, we can give our own object instructions to those other objects over there,
[0:09:15] SPEAKER_00: and then be controlling them in a way that's super helpful. Again, like you were saying,
[0:09:20] Unknown: the intent of this is often in innocence and unconscious, like this desire to help the world
[0:09:27] SPEAKER_00: out. But it's really desire to help the world or help people in the world get it together.
[0:09:33] Unknown: Like I've gotten it together. They can get it together.
[0:09:37] Unknown: Or do it better. Or do it better. Do it better. Yeah. Figure it out. Yeah. Be out of pain.
[0:09:42] Unknown: Excel. Be happier. Grab the brass ring. But it doesn't leave any spaciousness at all
[0:09:53] SPEAKER_00: that we all are capable of living our own lives and that life happens through us.
[0:10:00] Unknown: Not, you know, we input certain computational algorithms, and then we spit out exactly a
[0:10:09] SPEAKER_00: certain kind of life. It's just not how it goes. Life is infinitely more surprising than we give it
[0:10:14] Unknown: credit for, which is where it gets to be, of course, harmful. Because you're saying, why can't you be
[0:10:21] Unknown: the object that behaves? Meaning follows the trajectory that I've decided we've laid out.
[0:10:29] SPEAKER_01: Then you'll be happy and together. It hurts me to witness you not be in that place.
[0:10:34] Unknown: It hurts me to not be the one who's the helper. I can talk about that all day long too.
[0:10:40] Unknown: The helper identity. To know that I did that.
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_01: In what you were saying, the way that my mind kind of took it and held it was that we could look at
[0:10:51] SPEAKER_01: it from these two different vantage points. We could look at it at the level of the relative.
[0:10:57] SPEAKER_01: At the level of the relative, it's already a dilemma because I am not an object and Brooke
[0:11:03] SPEAKER_01: is not an object. Therefore, we each have our own subjective realities. Me assuming that everything
[0:11:11] SPEAKER_01: that I do would be helpful for you or everything that I think would be helpful for you or even that
[0:11:16] SPEAKER_01: you and I think the same way is like an obliteration of you, which we've talked about, about objectification.
[0:11:23] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of an annihilation of your subjective experience, which can be very harmful. That's
[0:11:29] SPEAKER_01: like the relative level. Then on the absolute level, you pointed towards one of our common
[0:11:36] SPEAKER_01: human misconceptions, which is that the ego is in control at all. Even if the advice is helpful,
[0:11:44] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I can't tell you how many times I sit with a client and I have what seems like a really
[0:11:49] SPEAKER_01: helpful piece of advice based on life experience, based on sitting with thousands of people,
[0:11:55] SPEAKER_01: all of these different things. Maybe the advice is even stop drinking. You clearly have a drinking
[0:12:00] Unknown: problem. It could be that level of obvious. Ten other experts would point to it. It doesn't work
[0:12:08] SPEAKER_01: until it's right for another person. The ego is not in control. It's this really interesting thing,
[0:12:15] SPEAKER_01: being in direct relationship with a human being. We can call it an empathic resonance
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_01: and starting to honor what is their subjective experience in an actual loving, non-harming way,
[0:12:33] Unknown: which like you said, so many of us didn't get. I mean, we don't even have space to have feelings
[0:12:39] SPEAKER_01: for fuck's sake. Here's how subtle it can be. I was talking to my dad the other day
[0:12:44] Unknown: and I'm still recovering from this flu. Every time I talk to him and I have the flu,
[0:12:50] SPEAKER_01: I just ignored him for the first few days. I didn't speak to anyone because I couldn't. I
[0:12:54] Unknown: didn't mean ignore him, but every time I'd speak to him, he insists on pointing towards how I'm
[0:13:01] SPEAKER_01: getting better. You know when you're like, actually, I still feel really tired. I feel really run down
[0:13:07] SPEAKER_01: and he's like, oh, but you're much better than last week. Clearly, you're getting better and
[0:13:13] SPEAKER_01: like you're happy and like he starts to kind of like layer on the experience, right?
[0:13:20] SPEAKER_01: Even in this simple way, what he's saying to me, what he's kind of painting into this moment is,
[0:13:28] SPEAKER_01: you would do better to be happy right now. You would do better to have a positive outlook and
[0:13:33] SPEAKER_01: look at the good things and not be with the pain. I would do better not to be with your pain.
[0:13:40] Unknown: He is subtly telling me the path through that he's describing, but you can see that the path is
[0:13:49] SPEAKER_01: loaded with his own biases and his own constrictions. In this case, my projection is, one of them is
[0:13:55] Unknown: the constriction he feels around being with people who are in pain. He is so intolerant
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_01: of pain in general, his own and others, right? So that's one of the constrictions he's identifying
[0:14:10] SPEAKER_01: for himself and then he's subtly pointing me towards how he operates. So how he operates is
[0:14:16] SPEAKER_01: he tries to focus on the bright side, but it's a lovely quality and I'm sure that has gotten him
[0:14:21] Unknown: through many a tough moment in life, but I'm not so sure that A, it's actually transformed him,
[0:14:28] Unknown: that B, it served his highest unfolding, and that C, I could walk the same path as him even if it did.
[0:14:37] Unknown: So there's this like, there's this call for us to show up in direct relationship
[0:14:48] Unknown: to the unfolding aliveness of another being. One of the things that gets me really fiery,
[0:14:57] SPEAKER_01: I don't know why I have a particularly like big button, is when I'm talking to clients and they're
[0:15:03] SPEAKER_01: either going through heartbreak or they want to find love and they just haven't found the love
[0:15:12] Unknown: that they need, right? The kind of love that they need. And then they have very well-meaning friends
[0:15:19] Unknown: giving them very simplistic advice. So things like, well, you should just get back out there.
[0:15:28] SPEAKER_01: That's what I did. That's what people do. Or, yeah, like why do you still care that you got your
[0:15:36] SPEAKER_01: heart broken? Why are you still thinking about that person? Or, well, it must be that you're just
[0:15:45] SPEAKER_01: looking in the wrong places. You know, there's all of these very well-intentioned bits of advice.
[0:15:54] SPEAKER_01: And what's really happening to the person on the receiving side of them so often is like they're
[0:16:00] Unknown: collapsing into pain and shame because the implication, here's this person that wants to
[0:16:08] SPEAKER_01: heal from their heartbreak or that so desperately wants to find good healthy love in their life. I
[0:16:14] SPEAKER_01: mean, it's so tender, so genuine in both cases. And they have a very well-intentioned outsider
[0:16:21] SPEAKER_01: telling them, well, everything would be okay if you weren't just doing it wrong.
[0:16:26] SPEAKER_00: Right. Yeah, we have such an intolerance for the mystery of life. You know, that I can't,
[0:16:34] Unknown: for example, read every book on building an amazing business, you know, being an amazing
[0:16:46] SPEAKER_00: entrepreneur and take every action that the book says and predict I'm going to become what I've
[0:16:56] SPEAKER_00: desired. Now, I do think that people who have a very heavy ego identification, God bless,
[0:17:03] SPEAKER_00: like in innocence, that certainly has been me for portions of my life. So, I'm not saying that is a
[0:17:07] Unknown: bad thing. But I do think that you have more capacity to force yourself into situations,
[0:17:14] Unknown: to will your way into things that are not a fit for you because you just don't hear the same signals
[0:17:23] SPEAKER_00: of exhaustion or it's not a fit or it's not a calling or, you know, don't try it that way,
[0:17:28] SPEAKER_00: try it this way. This is better fit for your personality or whatever. Or did you look over
[0:17:33] Unknown: there and look at that easy thing, that person who you met who has the connection you already
[0:17:38] SPEAKER_00: want instead of looking, you know, on the other side of the country to that shiny person someone
[0:17:42] SPEAKER_00: told you you need to connect with. So, there are a myriad of ways that ego identification makes it
[0:17:47] Unknown: easier for us to force will our way into things. But if we're, you know, people who are having these
[0:17:55] SPEAKER_00: kinds of conversations and listening to this kind of show, we have already started to
[0:18:01] Unknown: reckon with the fact that we are not 100% in control of, we're not these flesh robots
[0:18:09] SPEAKER_00: that we pilot with our ideas of who we are. And so, once we've already started that reckoning,
[0:18:15] SPEAKER_00: then we can't force ourselves to do things against our own will anymore. And so, we wind up
[0:18:24] SPEAKER_00: realizing like, there's just actually quite a lot of mystery to why anything unfolds a certain way.
[0:18:32] SPEAKER_00: And it's like some of the people I've really admired who've reached a great deal of success,
[0:18:37] SPEAKER_00: and I've heard them interviewed, it always really struck me when they would admit that.
[0:18:41] SPEAKER_00: Like Seth Godin, who's somebody who I love and adore, his work's been very meaningful to me.
[0:18:46] Unknown: He's written multiple bestselling books about marketing and culture and that kind of thing.
[0:18:57] SPEAKER_00: And he was like, there was some interview or something where I heard him say like,
[0:19:03] Unknown: a lot of it is just luck, you know, timing. And the guy works his ass off. So, he wasn't saying,
[0:19:11] SPEAKER_00: hey, I laid around until I got lucky. That's definitely not his personality. Or
[0:19:18] SPEAKER_00: is it Darrah Phillips or Darrah Williams, the Olympic swimmer who was really famous
[0:19:25] SPEAKER_00: during that particular summer Olympics because she was 41 or 42. And everyone was like, oh my God,
[0:19:30] SPEAKER_00: a woman in her 40s is winning all these golds and she's crushing it. She's amazing.
[0:19:34] Unknown: So, everyone wants to know what's your training regime? How did you pull this off?
[0:19:39] SPEAKER_00: And obviously, this is a woman who is so devoted, so dedicated. So, I'm not saying she was just like,
[0:19:46] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I jumped in the water and it worked out. You know, like she really, really,
[0:19:49] SPEAKER_00: really put in the hours. But what I found so admirable is that instead of just going on and
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_00: on and on about her impeccable training regime and that that is exactly why she won the gold,
[0:19:58] SPEAKER_00: she was like, you know what? I was just born to do this. Genetically, I have a body that is so good
[0:20:05] SPEAKER_00: at this and so powerful. And genetically, I have a mind that loves to obsessively train the fuck
[0:20:14] SPEAKER_00: out of myself until I achieve this amazing goal. I don't want to tell you, I was just born to do
[0:20:19] SPEAKER_00: this, which is so different than like, can you give everyone listening the blueprint of how to
[0:20:23] SPEAKER_00: be exactly like you? That's crazy. Like the multitude of mysteries that went into making
[0:20:30] SPEAKER_00: that Olympic swimmer or that bestselling author is so infinite and it's so complex.
[0:20:37] SPEAKER_00: And the more respect we can have for that, first of all, we're a lot more gentle with ourselves.
[0:20:43] SPEAKER_00: But then we're also so much more gentle with the people in our lives. Like the example that you
[0:20:49] SPEAKER_00: gave, let's say we have a dear friend who's been nursing a heartache for a long time and they
[0:20:53] SPEAKER_00: cannot find love and they are trying and they want to, instead of trying to hand them the blueprint,
[0:20:59] SPEAKER_00: if we appreciate the mystery, it just turns very quickly into a conversation that's like, oh,
[0:21:05] SPEAKER_00: sweetie, I'm sorry it hurts. I love you. Do you want to come over? You want me to cook dinner for
[0:21:10] SPEAKER_00: you tonight? It's a completely different kind of exchange. And then you feel seen and loved and
[0:21:16] Unknown: held and you feel like you have a connection to a community. And that's what actually transforms
[0:21:24] Unknown: a person.
[0:21:25] Unknown: And like you're not a problem.
[0:21:27] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[0:21:29] Unknown: Because as soon as you start to get that sense that how I'm feeling or the way that I'm existing
[0:21:35] SPEAKER_01: is problematic, it all goes really downhill fast. So I wanted to bring it closer with a couple of
[0:21:43] Unknown: examples. Okay, so I got the flu and I had a couple of very well-meaning, lovely people say to me
[0:21:51] SPEAKER_01: something like, oh, I never get sick because I tell my mind not to get sick.
[0:21:55] Unknown: I just want, I'm sorry, guys, I'm going to say something terrible. I want to punch them so much
[0:22:03] SPEAKER_00: for saying something like that. And I know I feel bad, just for a second, I feel bad for saying that.
[0:22:09] SPEAKER_00: I know that that makes me a bad person, everyone listening, and that they just need love too. But
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_00: sometimes, oh my God.
[0:22:17] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[0:22:18] Unknown: It's so frustrating because it hurts. I mean, that's why, right? Like you want to punch because
[0:22:23] SPEAKER_01: you know that it hurt me when someone said that to me, right? And so there's this
[0:22:28] SPEAKER_01: gut defense mechanism reaction that arises that's like, can you stop hurting people with these
[0:22:34] SPEAKER_01: well-meaning bits of information? And I remember Wayne Dyer saying something very similarly.
[0:22:42] SPEAKER_01: The way that he was doing mindset work was something like he would tell germs
[0:22:46] SPEAKER_01: that can't land on his body, you know, and I actually believe that there's some high level
[0:22:52] Unknown: of energy medicine where this may be possible, like a possible reality. But the thing is,
[0:22:58] Unknown: is that for someone who's been chronically sick and is currently suffering with the flu,
[0:23:03] SPEAKER_01: whatever that thing is that someone may or may not be doing, if that's even real,
[0:23:08] SPEAKER_01: if that's even the reason why they're not sick as opposed to just a banging immune system,
[0:23:13] SPEAKER_01: it's not available to me. It's clearly not available to me. If it was, I'd be doing it
[0:23:20] Unknown: because I want to be well, right? I don't want to be sick as much as popular psychology and
[0:23:28] SPEAKER_01: popular health psychology can say like, you just want to be sick or something. It's actually not
[0:23:33] SPEAKER_01: as simplistic as that. So in the moment that someone delivers that, when you know it's out
[0:23:40] SPEAKER_01: of someone's reach, when someone is currently suffering, it's not like I'm over it and, you
[0:23:46] Unknown: know, it's a miss. You can call it an empathic miss. And it's not only an empathic miss, but
[0:23:56] Unknown: what was delivered to me on a tray was, oh, honey, you've really been fucking up by not doing that
[0:24:04] SPEAKER_01: mindset work, huh? Look how much it's costing you, whether that person intended it or not.
[0:24:11] SPEAKER_01: So there was one more moment, and then I want to talk about how we might do it differently,
[0:24:17] SPEAKER_01: you know, and I actually, I mean, there's just a lot I want to say, but so I went to see a personal
[0:24:22] SPEAKER_01: trainer that was highly recommended to me. I told Brooke this story. Actually, I'd gone to see this
[0:24:28] Unknown: personal trainer right before, I think it was our last recording or the one before that. I can't
[0:24:33] SPEAKER_01: remember. Oh, yeah, it was right before. Yeah, it was right before. So I arrived for Brooke and I
[0:24:38] Unknown: to sit on Skype and chit chat about what we're going to talk about just in tears over this
[0:24:44] SPEAKER_01: personal training session. And what had happened was, you know, I've been sick for a long time,
[0:24:50] SPEAKER_01: and I have been minimally able to be physically active. And I'm finally emotionally and physically
[0:24:57] Unknown: ready to change that to reshape and get healthy and start moving again. So I arrived with much
[0:25:07] SPEAKER_01: hope and much vulnerability, which I had shared with the man, you know, in an email that this is
[0:25:13] SPEAKER_01: a very vulnerable thing for me, because I've been sick a long time. And because quite frankly,
[0:25:17] SPEAKER_01: the last time I was exercising, I was fainting and hitting the floor last time I was doing it
[0:25:22] SPEAKER_01: vigorously. So what happened was I arrived at this clearly very helpful, very well intentioned
[0:25:32] Unknown: young man's doorstep. He couldn't be more than 22 or something, very physically fit, clearly very
[0:25:39] SPEAKER_01: able bodied, never looks like a guy who never suffered from back pain in his life, you know,
[0:25:45] SPEAKER_01: that kind of a guy. And what happened was multiple times I expressed, I'm actually struggling too
[0:25:54] Unknown: hard. This isn't right. And I need to slow it down. And multiple times he overrode me with,
[0:26:03] Unknown: well, if it doesn't physically hurt, can't you just, you know, keep pushing?
[0:26:10] SPEAKER_01: Now it's so subtle, right? And isn't that a personal trainer's job to motivate you past your edges,
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_01: to push you when you feel like giving up on yourself? So clearly there's one level we would
[0:26:24] Unknown: say he did nothing wrong. But what was really happening was for whatever reason, he wasn't
[0:26:33] Unknown: comfortable with my level of capacity. And it doesn't matter if my level of capacity was
[0:26:41] SPEAKER_01: a psychological level of capacity or a physical level of capacity, an energetic one, a spiritual
[0:26:47] Unknown: one, or all of the above. I had a boundary and it was clear. And something about it
[0:26:57] SPEAKER_01: didn't agree with his view of the body or reality or what it means to be an effective trainer
[0:27:04] Unknown: or how he could be a helpful person. You know, like as a helpful person, he extended the session
[0:27:11] SPEAKER_01: like 30 minutes, which he always does to be like a really helpful trainer on the first session.
[0:27:17] SPEAKER_01: Well, guess what? That's not helpful. I didn't need 30 extra minutes of physical activity,
[0:27:23] SPEAKER_01: right? Like in reality, if he was in direct experience of me, what I needed was a small
[0:27:29] SPEAKER_01: bite-size win so I can feel inspired to be in direct relationship with my body and be connected
[0:27:35] SPEAKER_01: and come back again with optimism, right? But what needed to happen in that moment, and there's
[0:27:41] SPEAKER_01: really, this is not to be in judgment of him, it's because we can kind of tease this apart together
[0:27:46] Unknown: and look at it a different way. What could have happened in that moment was he could have listened
[0:27:53] SPEAKER_01: we've talked about listening before, like John Prendergast brings up listening,
[0:27:57] SPEAKER_01: John Lockley brought up listening, like actually listened, which requires him to be present with
[0:28:03] Unknown: this subjective being that is Vanessa and hear her and hear not just the top level of my
[0:28:10] SPEAKER_01: conversation, which may go, well, this is a little hard, but I guess I could do it to beneath that,
[0:28:18] SPEAKER_01: which is I'm actually struggling to beneath that, which is I only know how to say no so many times
[0:28:25] Unknown: before I feel like a burden and inadequate to beneath that, which is my body can't handle this,
[0:28:32] SPEAKER_01: I'm suffering, right? Like there's all of these different layers to a moment of communication
[0:28:39] Unknown: with someone. And if he was really present with me, aka not so invested in his own concept of what
[0:28:50] SPEAKER_01: a training session would look like or what's good for someone or what's healthy, we could have done
[0:28:56] SPEAKER_01: this very differently, right? He could have slowed down, he might have empathized and said,
[0:29:02] SPEAKER_01: wow, I can't imagine how hard that must have been to be fainting every time you exercise,
[0:29:07] Unknown: you must be scared or to not be able to exercise for two or three years when you're in your 40s,
[0:29:15] SPEAKER_01: my God, that must have been so hard. I can imagine you're overwhelmed starting over again,
[0:29:21] SPEAKER_01: or I could imagine that we have to go really slow and mindfully and listen to your body, right?
[0:29:26] SPEAKER_01: So you all get the feeling of what I'm trying to communicate is that to be in direct relationship,
[0:29:32] SPEAKER_01: to listen so that we don't inadvertently project what someone should be doing,
[0:29:40] SPEAKER_01: but rather try to listen to where they are so then in our intuitive wisdom, we can guide them,
[0:29:46] SPEAKER_01: facilitate them, support them and moving in a way that's really aligned and maybe just one step
[0:29:53] Unknown: past what they can do on their own, you know? If we can do all of that, we can be the greatest
[0:30:00] SPEAKER_01: allies to our clients, to our friends, to our family, to our lovers, but every time we assume
[0:30:09] SPEAKER_01: that the way that we have studied or the way that we have come to believe or the way that we do
[0:30:14] Unknown: something is the way in capital letters, we are most likely to be handing someone a tray of shame.
[0:30:25] SPEAKER_01: Whether they take it or not, that depends on their own wiring and what's up for them.
[0:30:31] SPEAKER_01: I took it by the end of that session. I was just in shame. I started off fine. I look a little
[0:30:38] SPEAKER_01: overweight. You know, I haven't moved my body in a while. I don't love looking at, you know,
[0:30:42] SPEAKER_01: he kept taking pictures of you. I'm like, I could do without the pictures of me in a sports bra,
[0:30:48] SPEAKER_01: you know? But okay, to at the end thinking I'm like a disgusting dysfunctional human being who
[0:30:56] SPEAKER_01: like doesn't deserve the right to live or I don't know, not quite as exaggerated as that,
[0:31:01] SPEAKER_01: but like really down on myself. It dissipated, thank God, pretty quickly. I'm not holding on
[0:31:08] SPEAKER_01: to the energy of I'm a yucky person anymore so easily, but you know, to someone else,
[0:31:13] SPEAKER_01: that might have bounced off their back and to someone else that might have been a shame spiral
[0:31:17] SPEAKER_00: for who knows how long. Yeah, who knows how long because these are sensitive issues and in general,
[0:31:23] SPEAKER_00: you know, shame is easily ingested by all of us because we're pretty. It's like the air we breathe,
[0:31:29] SPEAKER_01: I feel like. Look around. My God, the politics right now, all everyone ever does is shame the
[0:31:36] SPEAKER_01: other side of people who think differently. It's like we're so used to it that it doesn't even
[0:31:43] SPEAKER_01: occur to us that shame is perhaps the most poisonous, toxic, cruel thing we can do to one
[0:31:53] SPEAKER_01: another, to another human being or an animal or any alive sentient being. Probably the most
[0:32:01] SPEAKER_01: probably the most or one of the most poisonous things we can do is shame because even
[0:32:07] SPEAKER_01: you know, a lot of my clients who have survived physical abuse or sexual abuse,
[0:32:13] SPEAKER_01: you know, long after they heal physically, the shame is what remains. The shame is the
[0:32:22] Unknown: toxin that they're still navigating around. So it's so poisonous, but it's so fucking common.
[0:32:29] Unknown: We don't even realize that here we are very well-meaning people shaming the shit out of
[0:32:36] Unknown: each other. Yeah, I'm thinking about when we were at Dharma Ocean actually, which were right around
[0:32:42] SPEAKER_00: our two year anniversary. Really only two years. It feels like 20 years ago. I went and double
[0:32:47] SPEAKER_00: checked. I'm like, shit, it was 2016. I find it hard to even say two years. It's been so much
[0:32:52] SPEAKER_00: has happened in those two years. That was a lifetime big catalyst. But what I'm thinking
[0:32:57] Unknown: about was as cliche would have it when we were on meditation on silent retreat at Dharma Ocean,
[0:33:05] SPEAKER_00: I had, I think it was our first week there. I don't always have really clear visions when I
[0:33:12] SPEAKER_00: meditate. It's not like a acid trip the whole time, but every once in a while something pops
[0:33:16] SPEAKER_00: in and it lands, right? Like it arrives. It's not an idea. It's not something I'm thinking about.
[0:33:20] SPEAKER_00: I'm not daydreaming. It's like suddenly someone set up a movie screen and boop, it's right in front
[0:33:24] SPEAKER_00: of me and it's there to deliver a piece of information. When I was there, I had this moment
[0:33:29] SPEAKER_00: where what I saw, what I was shown, it didn't explain it to me with words, but I understood
[0:33:34] SPEAKER_00: that I was in this, at the time I was running the Liberated Body podcast and I was in this very small
[0:33:41] SPEAKER_00: office, like maybe two other people on laptops, but this clean white room, warehousey room,
[0:33:47] Unknown: high ceilings. It was clear that this was like Liberated Body HQ, that it was a thing and that
[0:33:54] SPEAKER_00: there were a couple other people who worked on it with me, which never became reality, but this is
[0:33:57] Unknown: what the vision showed me. The important part of this vision was that it's this huge white room,
[0:34:04] SPEAKER_00: like 18 foot high ceilings, kind of warehousey New York type space. One of these giant walls
[0:34:11] SPEAKER_00: that went way up to a ceiling was painted with the words, we don't do fear-mongering here.
[0:34:17] SPEAKER_00: It was this giant message and I was like, what? Any wisdom that comes to you from a place that's
[0:34:25] SPEAKER_00: not your separate self, it has a quality almost always that's surprising. I wasn't asking for
[0:34:33] SPEAKER_00: guidance about Liberated Body. I wasn't thinking it wasn't on my mind at all. I didn't feel like I
[0:34:38] SPEAKER_00: had any kind of quandary question, but it was this very clear, like, huh. What's funny is that at the
[0:34:46] SPEAKER_00: time I was surprised and I was intrigued. I was like, that's interesting because it was such a
[0:34:51] SPEAKER_00: dramatic, it was shown to me in such dramatic fashion, where it wasn't me daydreaming about
[0:34:57] Unknown: something. It was intriguing, but it did and continues to, after two years now, continue to
[0:35:06] SPEAKER_00: unfold where I really understood, like, this was a very powerful, very potent piece of wisdom for me,
[0:35:11] SPEAKER_00: for my life. And then also, I think not accidentally the way it was shown to me as
[0:35:15] Unknown: my work environment that I've created, that about my work life, that it is so the most sacred thing
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_00: for me to hold in anything related to my work life is we don't do fear-mongering here. And when
[0:35:32] Unknown: it first started to unfold as a kernel of wisdom, I became really interested in how the wellness
[0:35:39] Unknown: world, including me, spent so much time making people afraid about what they might do wrong
[0:35:51] Unknown: so that they could deliver the solution, so that they could do it right and wind up not having
[0:35:57] SPEAKER_00: the problem. You know, so for example, and I have a dear friend, Ginger Nash, who's a naturopathic
[0:36:02] SPEAKER_00: doctor and she and I joke all the time that we want to co-write a book together. We might actually
[0:36:06] SPEAKER_00: do it. You're doing it wrong and it's like each chapter is about something from the wellness world
[0:36:11] SPEAKER_00: that you're doing wrong. You're sleeping wrong. You're breathing wrong. You're walking wrong.
[0:36:15] SPEAKER_00: You're definitely moving wrong. You're standing wrong.
[0:36:16] SPEAKER_00: You're definitely eating wrong. Obviously, we need to dedicate 20 chapters. You're eating wrong,
[0:36:20] SPEAKER_00: don't eat meat. You're eating wrong, don't eat vegan. You're eating wrong, don't eat nuts. Don't
[0:36:27] SPEAKER_00: eat. Just don't eat. So the wellness community is so wrapped up in innocence. It's our culture.
[0:36:35] Unknown: It's capitalism. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Oh, unless you do this thing that I can deliver to
[0:36:44] SPEAKER_00: you that will be your salvation and you won't walk wrong so that you wind up with osteoarthritis.
[0:36:52] SPEAKER_00: Breathe wrong so that you wind up with tight traps and cracking a rib from your osteoporosis
[0:36:58] SPEAKER_00: when you're in your 80s because of your hunch. Or like the ways that we make people wrong and it
[0:37:04] SPEAKER_00: just keeps being illuminated to me. I think that in regards to the wellness industry, but also to
[0:37:10] SPEAKER_00: the world of like, I was going to say spirituality, but more like human relationality,
[0:37:15] Unknown: like how do we be here and how do we be with each other? For me, that's a very important one.
[0:37:25] SPEAKER_00: Where are the fear seeds that we're sowing? I really think unconsciously, so we have to just
[0:37:30] SPEAKER_00: get hip to be able to look for it. So first of all, we have to not shame ourselves, right? Like
[0:37:35] SPEAKER_00: we can say with a lot of affection to ourselves, like, okay, I exist within a culture where this
[0:37:41] SPEAKER_00: is what we do. This is the air that I have breathed for so long. It seems so normal to me. It seems
[0:37:48] SPEAKER_00: so normal to behave that way, to be afraid of what might go wrong and find out the answer in advance
[0:37:54] SPEAKER_00: that I can deliver to myself or to others so that things don't go wrong. But it's faulty.
[0:38:01] Unknown: It's a faulty logic and it's just feeding fear and feeding shame to people so that we can start
[0:38:08] SPEAKER_00: to catch it and unravel it. And what was interesting was that on going back to the liberated body
[0:38:14] SPEAKER_00: example, I was having conversations with all kinds of different people who are contributing
[0:38:20] SPEAKER_00: knowledge about what is the body really, you know, so surgeons, anatomists, researchers,
[0:38:26] Unknown: yoga teachers, all different kinds of people. And there was a moment where I really realized like,
[0:38:32] Unknown: oh, if I'm going to live by that, really, I didn't realize but I actually kind of have to change up
[0:38:39] Unknown: what I'm doing. And so what I navigated towards, and I think this can be helpful for us in our
[0:38:45] Unknown: personal lives as well as our professional lives, like if I'm not using fear as my North Star and
[0:38:53] SPEAKER_00: fear ultimately downstreams to making people feel shame, my North Star became wonder.
[0:39:01] SPEAKER_00: Like, what can we really hold the mystery in a way that delights in how miraculous it is,
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_00: how expansive it is, how unknowable it is, how wonderful is it to be this little human being
[0:39:17] Unknown: who is never going to figure it all out, who isn't going to know all the answers, who isn't
[0:39:21] SPEAKER_00: going to do it right, who isn't going to be perfect. And I can just dance with, you know,
[0:39:27] SPEAKER_00: to be a little corny, but really dance with my joy and how wondrous it all is, in this case,
[0:39:32] Unknown: the human body. But I think if we can do that in our relationship to ourselves and to the others
[0:39:38] SPEAKER_00: in our lives, that is such a powerful remedy that moves us away from the fear to shame dynamic.
[0:39:48] SPEAKER_01: I love that. Yeah, the mystery piece is a really big piece because
[0:39:55] SPEAKER_01: and thinking about, okay, so let's say you're talking to a friend or let's say you're talking
[0:40:02] SPEAKER_01: to a client and it sounds like they're in a bad relationship, right? And we all know what that
[0:40:09] SPEAKER_01: sounds like. You know, we've been sitting on the other side going, oh, this doesn't sound great,
[0:40:16] Unknown: right? Like, I'm a little bit disturbed about this relationship. And so we can give some really,
[0:40:25] SPEAKER_01: you know, well-meaning advice, like good advice, even really good advice, like, you know, I would
[0:40:30] SPEAKER_01: consider not marrying that person or maybe not having a child with them or, you know, maybe it's
[0:40:35] SPEAKER_01: time you might want to consider ending that relationship. And that might be really solid
[0:40:41] SPEAKER_01: advice coming from clarity and wisdom. But the thing I've always realized at the very same moment
[0:40:46] Unknown: as that is there is so much to this world I do not understand. Because if it was as easy as us just
[0:40:55] SPEAKER_01: following good advice like that, then we would all be happier. I mean, there is no lack of really
[0:41:01] SPEAKER_01: good wise advice out there, especially in today's day and age with the internet. And I look at
[0:41:07] SPEAKER_01: people's relationships and I'm like, well, I don't know why you're with them. I mean, it doesn't look
[0:41:12] SPEAKER_01: to me from the outside, like the relationship one should want to be in to be healthy, but I don't
[0:41:18] SPEAKER_01: know about this karma thing. Could you guys have been in a past life together? Do you need to go
[0:41:25] SPEAKER_01: through this? Because there's something that your soul is trying to work through that it needs this
[0:41:31] SPEAKER_01: very experience, this very person, and it won't be done until it's literally done, right? Until that
[0:41:38] SPEAKER_01: seed that wants to be born has been planted. I mean, how do I know? So even when it comes to really
[0:41:45] Unknown: what seems like sound credible advice, the way that I approach it, you know, so in all its complexity,
[0:41:52] SPEAKER_01: because, you know, when you're counseling and coaching people all day long, or just even when
[0:41:56] SPEAKER_01: your friends come to you, that the conundrum I run into is I don't want to be a busybody. I have to
[0:42:03] SPEAKER_01: mind my own business and not just assume I know the right way for you to live. I have the ultimate
[0:42:11] Unknown: honor that other people know better than me. At the same time, because I'm intuitive, and I'm outside
[0:42:20] SPEAKER_01: them, and I'm seeing patterns that you can't see sometimes when you're in your own forest,
[0:42:27] Unknown: it's my job to also offer that to them. So there's this interesting balancing act that this is just
[0:42:34] SPEAKER_01: my personal opinion, people could, you know, debate what my job is all day long. But for me,
[0:42:41] SPEAKER_01: it can be really helpful to show someone what you're seeing in their patterns. But to assume
[0:42:46] Unknown: you know better than them can be really harmful and really shamey. So it's almost like the way
[0:42:53] Unknown: that I tend to approach it is if advice is what bubbles up, if it bubbles up for me intuitively
[0:43:01] SPEAKER_01: to point someone towards something like you might consider this or this doesn't sound healthy,
[0:43:08] SPEAKER_01: I will do that. And somehow, because it's true for me, at the very same moment, I am able to
[0:43:15] Unknown: communicate and I love you no matter what you do. This is for you to figure out you are the
[0:43:23] Unknown: ultimate authority. Please just get curious and aware. And anything you do, we're together,
[0:43:32] Unknown: right? Like, and that's it. I think, especially if we're going to talk about the wellness industry,
[0:43:38] SPEAKER_01: since so many listeners are in the wellness industry, and it is remarkably weird how
[0:43:43] SPEAKER_01: shamey it's become, you know, medicine in general, and all of these different things, you know,
[0:43:49] SPEAKER_01: we are looking at this kind of paradoxical situation where people are coming to you as expert,
[0:43:55] Unknown: right? Like you're the expert. You've got to tell me, right? If I'm, if I am in back pain and I'm
[0:44:01] SPEAKER_01: slumped over to the left, I do expect you to point that out to me so I can learn something, right?
[0:44:08] SPEAKER_01: You know, or if my psoas is tight from sitting too much, like,
[0:44:12] SPEAKER_00: I'm laughing. I'm not going to say, but isn't it amazing that your spine can take whatever shape
[0:44:17] SPEAKER_00: it takes? Like, it's not that kind of awful, just saccharin. It's all so wondrous, though.
[0:44:23] SPEAKER_01: But it's wonderful. I'm in wonder. It's like, no, just tell me that I'm sitting too much.
[0:44:29] SPEAKER_01: On my couch like a lazy ass, you know, point it out to me, right?
[0:44:32] SPEAKER_01: But so we have to, we have to offer the experience and wisdom that our schooling and our life and our
[0:44:41] Unknown: client base has offered us. But can we do it at the very same moment as being in direct relationship
[0:44:48] SPEAKER_01: with that person and listening to what they're actually struggling with, listening to what they're
[0:44:54] SPEAKER_01: actually capable of, listening to what is medicinal and loving for them so that we can offer
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_01: our intuition in a way that doesn't create harm, quite frankly. No micro shaming. Say no to micro
[0:45:09] Unknown: shaming. Just say no to micro shaming. I don't know if that's a real term, but it is now. Branded now.
[0:45:16] Unknown: Bam. And, you know, can we invite them? Can we co-inquire together? You know, like if somebody's
[0:45:27] SPEAKER_00: coming to me, yeah, like I have, you know, 17 years in practice and I have spent a lot of deep
[0:45:36] SPEAKER_00: inquiry time on the human body more than most. And so I have a lot to offer. And then there are
[0:45:43] SPEAKER_00: these certain repeatable patterns that we see in culture. People who sit too long or people who
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_00: are convinced that their spine is a stack of blocks and they need to tuck their butt under and
[0:45:51] Unknown: pull themselves up straight. And so I can deliver to them in a shaming way, right? Like,
[0:45:59] Unknown: but spines aren't straight. Look, it's shaped like an S. Stop it. Right? Not like I would ever talk
[0:46:05] Unknown: like that. Or I can invite them into a different kind of experience of themselves. You know, like,
[0:46:12] SPEAKER_00: how, when you do that, when you really tuck your pelvis out under and effortfully pull at your spine
[0:46:18] SPEAKER_00: all the time, how does that go? And I don't say it in a condescending way because people really
[0:46:23] SPEAKER_00: do need to feel themselves. And so, you know, usually they're like, oh, I get exhausted and then
[0:46:29] SPEAKER_00: I can't do it. And then I get slumped again and I pull myself. I'm like, yeah, it winds up being
[0:46:32] Unknown: this tug of war with yourself. And actually our bodies are shaped, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[0:46:38] SPEAKER_00: Give them information about how spines are shaped a little bit. Can you play with, can you notice?
[0:46:43] SPEAKER_00: What is it like when you try this? And then people feel like they're engaged in a relational
[0:46:50] SPEAKER_00: conversation with me and also an experience of themselves where they get to have wonder for their
[0:46:55] SPEAKER_00: own selves. I wonder, not even just like, isn't it amazing? But just a very simple, like, I wonder if,
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_00: I wonder if I do play with not tugging at myself all the time, how does that go?
[0:47:09] SPEAKER_00: And that's a very different thing than micro shaming. So that's a very
[0:47:16] SPEAKER_00: useful way. I was going to make fun of myself. Quick tips, folks. Quick tips for not micro
[0:47:20] SPEAKER_00: shaming. But that's a really useful way to engage with people.
[0:47:24] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I think we're talking about, you know, being loving, like, like what Matt Khan says, like,
[0:47:29] SPEAKER_01: who you are is not what you do. It's how you love. And you and I recognize that what we do for work
[0:47:35] Unknown: is a reflection of how we love. So, I mean, it's such an important way, because even as we observe
[0:47:40] Unknown: the ways we can do this with others, we know that we're doing the same thing with ourselves.
[0:47:45] SPEAKER_01: Whatever we do with others, we tend to be repeating with ourselves. And so,
[0:47:49] SPEAKER_01: so, okay, can I just rail on the medical industry a little bit more?
[0:47:53] SPEAKER_00: Do it. Do it. Do it.
[0:47:54] SPEAKER_00: Just a couple more minutes.
[0:48:01] Unknown: Okay, so y'all, here's a confession. This is not really, but it feels like one to me.
[0:48:07] Unknown: I have just read the book Medical Medium. And that feels like a confession because I'm a Chinese
[0:48:12] SPEAKER_01: medicine doctor by background and I'm not supposed to just be reading about intuition and what one
[0:48:18] Unknown: should eat based on angels telling a medium. Yeah, you resisted reading that one for years.
[0:48:25] Unknown: Years. And I read it. And it was really fucking interesting. But what I want to bring your
[0:48:31] SPEAKER_01: attention towards was some of the things he was talking about with health trends and how even
[0:48:37] SPEAKER_01: disease diagnoses are made and then assumed to be real and then passed on through the culture.
[0:48:43] SPEAKER_01: Things I thought were really interesting. So, for example,
[0:48:47] SPEAKER_01: he was talking about things like fibromyalgia. I think he might have even specifically been
[0:48:52] SPEAKER_01: talking about fibromyalgia. But it was the kind of things that the medical industry tends to say
[0:48:57] SPEAKER_01: are more hysterical, like hysterical symptoms for women. So, he was saying, you know,
[0:49:04] SPEAKER_01: a lot of these kinds of mysterious ailments like fibromyalgia, women are more prone to.
[0:49:11] SPEAKER_01: And I forgot the reason he gave, but I do believe it had something to do with their energetic
[0:49:15] SPEAKER_01: makeup, like just our energetic nature as beings, as bodies. And so, they would go into these
[0:49:23] SPEAKER_01: offices and complain oftentimes to a patriarchal male figure. Not all the time, but that's often
[0:49:31] SPEAKER_01: the case, especially when some of these disease names were created, like rewinding the clock
[0:49:37] Unknown: 20 years ago or more. And they didn't know what to say to them. The doctor wouldn't know what it was.
[0:49:45] Unknown: They would do a bunch of tests. They couldn't identify it. And rather than say, I don't know,
[0:49:52] Unknown: the doctor would say, well, it's probably in your head. Maybe you're depressed.
[0:50:00] SPEAKER_01: That's just interesting. If you just think about it, instead of saying, I don't know,
[0:50:05] SPEAKER_00: there's no capacity for that for some people in the medical field.
[0:50:10] SPEAKER_01: And we can look at every field. You can look at your partner. You can look at your family
[0:50:15] SPEAKER_01: and recognize how often it is that instead of someone saying, I don't know, they will give you
[0:50:24] Unknown: a misguided answer. And in this case, an answer that made you a problem, an issue. I don't know,
[0:50:34] SPEAKER_01: probably you're actually not happy with your life and you're not admitting it to yourself.
[0:50:39] SPEAKER_01: Probably you're just not dealing with stress well. I mean, everyone else seems to, but I guess not
[0:50:44] SPEAKER_01: you because you break out into a pain pattern around stress. Right. And he went on to say, even
[0:50:50] SPEAKER_01: in his opinion, don't write to us about this. Take it or not. I mean, it's really just his opinion.
[0:50:59] SPEAKER_01: Just kidding everybody. But in his opinion, that autoimmune disease is a fallacy and that it's
[0:51:05] SPEAKER_01: really someone's immune system attacking a virus that Western medicine is just not identifying
[0:51:10] SPEAKER_01: that that's what the antibody is for and that people's bodies don't attack themselves. Now,
[0:51:16] SPEAKER_01: if you think about the way autoimmune disease has been kind of bantered around in the popular culture,
[0:51:24] SPEAKER_01: when you start to get to the psycho spiritual circles, it's like you're attacking yourself.
[0:51:29] SPEAKER_01: Why are you doing that? Right. And so the person who's gotten an autoimmune diagnosis
[0:51:36] SPEAKER_01: is often left to help the question. Wow. I really don't love myself. Why am I attacking myself? I
[0:51:42] SPEAKER_01: must not love myself. I mean, what's going on that's so serious that I'm in full on attack
[0:51:48] Unknown: of my own body. Now, what if that's wrong and it's not an attack of your own body? What if he's right?
[0:51:56] Unknown: What if there's just a virus that medicine hasn't identified yet? But the cultural agreement
[0:52:04] Unknown: that this is your own body attacking itself has gotten picked up into popular circles, especially
[0:52:12] Unknown: by like pseudo spirituality and pseudo psychology to mean you hate yourself on some level that
[0:52:19] SPEAKER_01: you're against yourself. And can you imagine the levels of shame that arise as you think,
[0:52:25] Unknown: why am I destroying myself? How could I do this to myself? At the same time as you're suffering
[0:52:33] Unknown: from all of the symptoms of autoimmune disorder, quote unquote, right. So, you know, I started
[0:52:39] Unknown: thinking about this and I'm like, this is crazy. The level to which both individuals and our culture
[0:52:49] Unknown: can make assumptions about what's real and what's true and then hand them to you.
[0:52:56] SPEAKER_01: These assumptions can be based on people's own misguided fear of pain. Like I said about my dad,
[0:53:02] SPEAKER_01: they could be based on people's discomfort, not knowing, not being expert enough. They could be
[0:53:07] SPEAKER_01: based on people's fear of falling apart. You know, they're based on all of these different ways that
[0:53:14] Unknown: we as humans can get contracted. And then they hand it to you on a platter and you accept it
[0:53:21] Unknown: and somehow agree that you're just the fucked up person because anyone should be able to just not
[0:53:28] SPEAKER_01: get sick if they just put their mind to it, or you should be able to be happy if you just think
[0:53:33] SPEAKER_01: better thoughts or, you know, you shouldn't be grieving your parents death after a year or two
[0:53:38] SPEAKER_01: because other people get over it.
[0:53:45] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and it's about, you know, I think we're healthier as individuals and we're certainly
[0:53:49] Unknown: healthier collectively if we can make space for the mystery, you know, that we're not,
[0:53:56] SPEAKER_00: that life is really happening through us. We're not in control of it and we can't fully understand
[0:54:03] SPEAKER_00: it or pin it down or make it behave or predict it. And if we can hang out with that a little
[0:54:08] SPEAKER_00: more, it feels so scary to the ego. It's what all the conversations about groundlessness are about.
[0:54:13] Unknown: But really it's the place where, you know, genuine love and a healthier relationship to the self and
[0:54:19] Unknown: healthier cultures can spring from. I think like to loop it back around one last time to paradox,
[0:54:30] SPEAKER_01: I just want to like bring that home a little more strongly before we wrap up because
[0:54:37] Unknown: I'm thinking about, I remember learning a little bit of applied kinesiology. Actually,
[0:54:43] SPEAKER_01: I think it's probably more appropriate to say I learned a little bit of muscle testing.
[0:54:47] SPEAKER_01: And so when you would be testing someone, the teacher was speaking about how you had to approach
[0:54:52] SPEAKER_01: them and really try to clear your mind and say like, I don't know, right? Like approaching them,
[0:54:59] SPEAKER_01: touching their body, already trying to clear your mind from the thought that you might know
[0:55:03] SPEAKER_01: what was happening with them or what the answer would be. Just so hard for us as humans. So I was
[0:55:08] SPEAKER_01: like going up to people to like, you know, test their shoulder with the questions and I would just
[0:55:12] SPEAKER_01: be saying in my head, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. And I think, you know, in Zen, they
[0:55:19] Unknown: talk about beginner's mind. The paradox is that we have to be able to approach each situation
[0:55:27] SPEAKER_01: exactly the same time, bringing our wisdom, our intuition and our clarity to one another,
[0:55:33] SPEAKER_01: so that we can offer our gifts to the world and lift each other up and support each other in
[0:55:39] Unknown: creating a better place for our civilization. And also hold, and I don't know, like I don't know for
[0:55:50] SPEAKER_01: a fact, you know, because even when we look at crazy like global stuff, like I know what I think
[0:55:57] SPEAKER_01: should happen, I know how I think it should go and I believe it and it doesn't mean I won't fight for
[0:56:02] SPEAKER_01: it. I mean, I may fight for it, but at the same time as I recognize the mystery, it's like,
[0:56:08] SPEAKER_01: but I don't know, I don't know what policy will set what policy will set what policy up. I don't
[0:56:16] SPEAKER_01: know. And if we get smaller and more micro into our lives, it's, I may think I know
[0:56:22] SPEAKER_01: what someone should do in their relationship and I should offer that. And at the same time,
[0:56:28] Unknown: really hold deeply in my cells and I don't know. And I think if we can, weirdly enough,
[0:56:37] SPEAKER_01: hold both at the same exact time, there's a sweet spot there.
[0:56:43] SPEAKER_00: I think we got to end it with that because that is some really, really good stuff to ponder for a
[0:56:48] SPEAKER_00: long time. Like how do we hold both? It's powerful.
