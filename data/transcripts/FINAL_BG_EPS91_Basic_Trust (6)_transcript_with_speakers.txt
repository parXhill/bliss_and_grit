[0:00:30] SPEAKER_00: Hello, beautifuls. You are listening to Bliss and Grit.
[0:00:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm Vanessa Scotto and I'll be joined soon by my dear friend and co-host Brooke Thomas.
[0:00:39] SPEAKER_00: On the show, we're having conversations about the awakening spiritual path, including themes
[0:00:45] Unknown: like embodiment, healing, and being human.
[0:00:50] SPEAKER_00: Today, inspired by the teachings of A. H. Almas, we're discussing a concept he calls
[0:00:58] SPEAKER_00: Basic Trust. Basic Trust is like the implicit sense that we're connected, safe, held, and
[0:01:05] SPEAKER_00: supported by life.
[0:01:07] SPEAKER_00: What really fascinated us about this concept is the revelation that once trust gets ruptured,
[0:01:14] SPEAKER_00: spiritual aspirations such as surrender, acceptance, or letting go can feel really out of reach
[0:01:22] SPEAKER_00: or just simply effortful.
[0:01:25] SPEAKER_00: Also, how much or how little basic trust you have can affect the quality and experience of your
[0:01:31] SPEAKER_00: spiritual awakening journey.
[0:01:34] SPEAKER_00: In this conversation, we explore, of course, our perspectives on basic trust, as well as get into
[0:01:41] Unknown: Almas's definition and how basic trust is fed, ruptured, and ultimately, how we heal.

[0:02:49] SPEAKER_00: So if you're in mixed company, you may want to pop some headphones in.
[0:02:53] Unknown: Okay, everyone, here we go.
[0:02:58] SPEAKER_00: Hello, darling Brooke.
[0:03:00] SPEAKER_00: Hello, how are you?
[0:03:02] SPEAKER_01: I'm doing good today, darling.
[0:03:04] SPEAKER_01: How are you?
[0:03:05] SPEAKER_01: I'm doing very well.
[0:03:08] SPEAKER_01: I was just wrestling with my computer, but otherwise I'm doing great.
[0:03:13] SPEAKER_00: We worked it out.
[0:03:15] SPEAKER_00: We did, didn't we?
[0:03:16] SPEAKER_00: Somehow, again.
[0:03:18] SPEAKER_00: Again.
[0:03:19] Unknown: Well, as this is our second episode back from break, I think it would be delightful to pick
[0:03:27] SPEAKER_00: up on a topic we began to touch on last week, actually, right?
[0:03:33] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we talked about it a little bit.
[0:03:34] Unknown: Last week's episode was funny because here we are talking about awakening in this really,
[0:03:42] SPEAKER_00: this is what we're going to be talking about kind of way.
[0:03:45] SPEAKER_00: Afterwards, I was laughing.
[0:03:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, I'm not even sure how many people didn't know that or did know that.
[0:03:50] SPEAKER_00: I don't know if that was a revelation just for us or for everyone.
[0:03:53] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[0:03:54] Unknown: Or even that it's so firm, like, yes, this is, I'm like, well, it kind of encompasses everything.
[0:04:00] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't need to be so like-
[0:04:02] SPEAKER_01: Explicit.
[0:04:03] Unknown: Yeah.
[0:04:04] SPEAKER_00: Well, whatever.
[0:04:05] SPEAKER_00: We needed to do it, obviously, for us.
[0:04:08] SPEAKER_00: And we did it wholly and perfectly because how do you talk about these things?
[0:04:13] SPEAKER_00: So I want to build upon something though, and it sort of relates to that, actually.
[0:04:19] SPEAKER_00: So today we're going to be exploring a topic called basic trust.
[0:04:24] SPEAKER_00: It's a topic written about and spoken about by a teacher named A.H.
[0:04:28] SPEAKER_00: Almaz, who we will share on our website in the show notes.
[0:04:33] SPEAKER_00: And I think it's really relevant, important, enlightening for me, for my clients,
[0:04:40] SPEAKER_00: I imagine will be for all of you.
[0:04:42] Unknown: And he writes about it in particular in reference to awakening.
[0:04:48] Unknown: So what he's saying is all humans are on an awakening journey to some extent, conscious
[0:04:54] Unknown: or unconscious, and that this quality that he's describing as basic trust sort of implies how
[0:05:02] SPEAKER_00: you will go through this journey.
[0:05:05] SPEAKER_00: In other words, the more trust you have, the easier the unfolding will be as you come to
[0:05:11] SPEAKER_00: awaken to your true self.
[0:05:13] SPEAKER_00: And the less you have, the more gritty it might be, the more chafie it might be as you
[0:05:21] SPEAKER_00: keep having these things come into your path.
[0:05:24] SPEAKER_00: So I think this concept says a lot about our human experience.
[0:05:28] SPEAKER_00: I think it says a lot about our healing experience.
[0:05:31] SPEAKER_00: And I think it also says something about what awakening may be like for us.
[0:05:37] SPEAKER_00: So today we're going to do something.
[0:05:39] SPEAKER_00: We often do this.
[0:05:40] Unknown: We read quotes, things that stimulated our thought process or our healing process.
[0:05:47] SPEAKER_00: But today I'm going to on and off read quite a bit from his book.
[0:05:51] SPEAKER_00: It's called Facets of Unity.
[0:05:53] SPEAKER_00: Just because this concept of trust is pretty deep, it's pretty specific, and he says it
[0:05:59] SPEAKER_00: so well, why should we say it ourselves?
[0:06:02] SPEAKER_00: And we'll just read from it.
[0:06:03] SPEAKER_00: And then Brooke and I will share our experience or thoughts.
[0:06:08] SPEAKER_00: You ready, Brooke?
[0:06:09] SPEAKER_00: I'm so ready.
[0:06:10] Unknown: Okay, me too.
[0:06:12] SPEAKER_00: Let's do it.
[0:06:13] Unknown: Okay.
[0:06:14] SPEAKER_00: So let me begin by sharing a definition of sorts of basic trust.
[0:06:20] SPEAKER_00: And it'll be a little bit long.
[0:06:22] Unknown: Everybody just relax, take a breath, close your eyes, and see if you can take this in
[0:06:27] SPEAKER_00: and relate with it.
[0:06:29] Unknown: So basic trust is an unspoken, implicit trust that what is optimal will happen.
[0:06:38] SPEAKER_00: The sense that whatever happens will ultimately be fine.
[0:06:42] Unknown: It is the confidence that reality is ultimately good, that nature, the universe, and all that
[0:06:49] Unknown: exists are of their very nature good and trustworthy, that what happens is the best that can happen.
[0:06:57] SPEAKER_00: Basic trust is a non-conceptual confidence in the goodness of the universe, an unquestioned,
[0:07:05] SPEAKER_00: implicit trust that there's something about the universe and human nature and life that's
[0:07:11] SPEAKER_00: inherently and fundamentally good, loving, and wishing us the best.
[0:07:18] SPEAKER_00: With basic trust, you feel in your bones that you are and will be okay, even if the events at the
[0:07:27] SPEAKER_00: moment are disappointing or painful or even completely disastrous.
[0:07:33] SPEAKER_00: Consequently, you live your life in such a way that you naturally jump into the abyss without
[0:07:39] SPEAKER_00: even conceptualizing that you will be okay, since you have the implicit trust or sense that the
[0:07:46] SPEAKER_00: universe will take care of you.
[0:07:49] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to read one last little bit of this.
[0:07:52] SPEAKER_00: Basic trust is the soul's way of attuning to a fundamental law of reality.
[0:07:59] SPEAKER_00: The fact that our sense of existing as a separate and isolated entity is false,
[0:08:06] SPEAKER_00: that our ego experience of isolation and helplessness is an illusion based on
[0:08:12] SPEAKER_00: identification with the world of physical manifestation.
[0:08:17] SPEAKER_00: Knowing that we are all part of one reality means that our true nature is not defined by
[0:08:24] Unknown: ego experience or the physical body and cannot be fundamentally hurt or destroyed.
[0:08:32] SPEAKER_00: I think that last part is really important because it sort of defines the context of basic trust.
[0:08:38] Unknown: We're not just talking about trust that things will go the way I want them to go.
[0:08:44] SPEAKER_00: We're not just trusting that our feelings won't get hurt or even that our physical form won't get
[0:08:49] SPEAKER_00: hurt.
[0:08:50] SPEAKER_00: He's really outlined the context by which this trust exists.
[0:08:54] Unknown: It's the trust of the soul that knows we are fundamentally a part of the universe and
[0:09:01] SPEAKER_00: extricably we're made up of the fabric of the universe and that the soul goes on.
[0:09:07] SPEAKER_00: We're talking about a soul level trust.
[0:09:10] SPEAKER_00: Part of why I thought this was really important or interesting to share is in other parts of the
[0:09:17] SPEAKER_00: book. He goes on to say that these wonderful spiritual aspirations that you and I both have,
[0:09:22] Unknown: and I know many of our listeners have, like trusting the universe, surrendering to life,
[0:09:30] SPEAKER_00: going with the flow, accepting that all of these things naturally arise without effort when basic
[0:09:39] SPEAKER_00: trust is present. But without basic trust often seem to be things we're grasping at and often
[0:09:46] SPEAKER_00: things that are motivated by the ego structure, which can't surrender to life, can't trust,
[0:09:52] Unknown: can't because its fundamental nature is formed without basic trust.
[0:09:58] SPEAKER_00: We can talk more about that, the ego and the soul and all of these things.
[0:10:02] SPEAKER_00: I thought this is really interesting because as we go we can describe how basic trust unfolds
[0:10:09] Unknown: and why most of us don't have it, why it's relevant in our healing journey to look at it,
[0:10:18] SPEAKER_00: but also because we could be so hard on ourselves like, why aren't I just surrendering already?
[0:10:24] SPEAKER_00: Why can't I trust life? I think this is a really important aspect to bring in.
[0:10:32] SPEAKER_00: Life's been really fucking hard for some of us and there's been a lot of pain and there's a lot
[0:10:37] Unknown: of pain that we see around us and all of these different things. This aspect of not knowing that
[0:10:45] SPEAKER_00: we're inextricably a part of life and that we can trust the benevolence that is in your bones,
[0:10:50] SPEAKER_00: not a concept, but so deep down you never even think about it, this is a part of why we struggle
[0:10:56] SPEAKER_00: with these beautiful spiritual aspirations that we're drawn towards. So let's dive in a little bit.
[0:11:02] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean I've certainly, I hear all the same words that all the rest of us hear on the path,
[0:11:09] SPEAKER_01: which are useful pointers, but if you have no context for what they are experientially,
[0:11:15] SPEAKER_01: it's challenging and so surrender. I mean you and I, we have a t-shirt that we sell,
[0:11:20] SPEAKER_01: trust your life, right? So this is something that's really important to us and it is a lived
[0:11:26] SPEAKER_01: ongoing inquiry, right? That that phrase is so important to us because it's such a crucial
[0:11:33] Unknown: inquiry for each of us and such a good and beautiful and useful pointer on the path.
[0:11:42] Unknown: And I would say that there's something deepening in me and in large part because you and I have
[0:11:48] SPEAKER_01: brought this up as like a topic, something to inquire about in real time on the show.
[0:11:56] SPEAKER_01: So I've spent a lot of time in the past six months to a year with the word surrender
[0:12:02] SPEAKER_01: as an inquiry. I don't understand this word to a certain degree. Like, of course I know what the
[0:12:10] SPEAKER_01: textbook dictionary definition is, but I notice that I can't,
[0:12:17] SPEAKER_01: it's not an action I can decide to have and choose cognitively and then follow through on
[0:12:24] SPEAKER_01: or not. It's not, am I doing a good job surrendering or a bad job surrendering?
[0:12:29] SPEAKER_01: And it's not the bypass ideas of like, become the slow blinker, right? Just chill out or just accept
[0:12:37] SPEAKER_01: that you're going to be laying around in the muck and that's how life goes. You know, like we can see
[0:12:43] SPEAKER_01: all these different variations of it. And so it's been interesting to live and to watch with
[0:12:49] SPEAKER_01: awareness internally in myself because it's the, I can't go to there. You know, there's this longing
[0:12:55] Unknown: to know what that means experientially and quote unquote inability or foreignness. It's like this
[0:13:04] SPEAKER_01: foreign planet. And so when you brought up basic trust in the last week, it just keeps deepening.
[0:13:11] SPEAKER_01: Again, epiphanies are always so dumb when you say them with words, but when you experience them,
[0:13:17] SPEAKER_01: they are profound truths and life altering. And it's like, oh my God, of course,
[0:13:25] SPEAKER_01: of course I can't go to there. There's this foundational ingredient missing of basic trust.
[0:13:34] SPEAKER_01: And then once I kind of got that on an experiential level, I was reminded of an experience I had
[0:13:42] SPEAKER_01: year and a half, two years ago. So when I was really in it with Dark Night of the Soul,
[0:13:48] SPEAKER_01: there was a period of time, people who've listened to the show before have heard me talk about this,
[0:13:52] SPEAKER_01: but there was a period of time where if I wasn't, like I could be very functional,
[0:13:57] Unknown: high functioning for my clients at work, totally normal, feel totally normal. I wasn't putting on
[0:14:03] SPEAKER_01: a happy face and I could be very functional, happy, totally normal in parenting. But when I
[0:14:09] SPEAKER_01: wasn't playing one of those two actions out in my life, I was pretty much on bed rest. And sometimes
[0:14:18] SPEAKER_01: when I was with clients or parenting, I would kind of get the information and it was actually like a
[0:14:24] SPEAKER_01: physical sensation that would get so big in my system that I had to go like lay down in a room.
[0:14:31] SPEAKER_01: So there was one night where I had a full night of clients booked and I saw three of them. And
[0:14:37] SPEAKER_01: then I got the urgent message in my system for lack of better way of describing it of like,
[0:14:43] Unknown: you have to cancel out your last clients and go home. And I did. It wasn't optional.
[0:14:50] SPEAKER_01: Even though when you're self-employed, you always think about the money part. When you're self-employed
[0:14:54] SPEAKER_01: and you have money stories. But I was like, it's just not optional. So I went home. I was home
[0:15:02] SPEAKER_01: alone because my son was still where he was supposed to be for the next three hours of
[0:15:06] SPEAKER_01: childcare. And I was told to lay down on the floor, told, you know, internal information was
[0:15:12] Unknown: provided. And I laid down and then I was taken through this video tour. I often get video tours.
[0:15:22] SPEAKER_01: All of these words are so imperfect for what I'm trying to describe. But if I could put words to
[0:15:28] Unknown: what I saw, it was that it was almost like God was the needle and I was the thread.
[0:15:37] SPEAKER_01: So I was threaded through this sewing needle of God. And it was showing me stitching through the
[0:15:44] SPEAKER_01: tapestry of my last six years or something. And it was showing me all the hard parts,
[0:15:51] SPEAKER_01: which had involved a lot of hard parts, like a business that failed, real financial hardship,
[0:15:56] SPEAKER_01: like maybe facing bankruptcy, divorce, becoming a new parent, not coping particularly well with that,
[0:16:03] SPEAKER_01: an abusive relationship after my divorce. You know, and it just showed me all of these. It was a
[0:16:07] Unknown: very painful period of my life. And what it was showing, what it was conveying, this movie was,
[0:16:16] SPEAKER_01: I could see how the needle would go up and through. So God and me going up and through very
[0:16:22] SPEAKER_01: painful experience. And then it would sew down next to the fabric. And I could see how I was
[0:16:29] SPEAKER_01: beautifully and profoundly transformed by each of those experiences. That first of all,
[0:16:34] Unknown: I survived them. They're not still happening. Like in this moment laying on the floor, that's not
[0:16:42] SPEAKER_01: happening. Actually, the reality of my actual life, other than the fact that I'm in this dark night,
[0:16:47] SPEAKER_01: is that it's pretty content. Like it's really set up in a very supportive, contented way.
[0:16:54] Unknown: There's a lot of health, robust health in my life. And then it would show me how it would go up
[0:17:01] SPEAKER_01: through another one of those very painful experiences and then go back down in the sense
[0:17:05] SPEAKER_01: that I saw that I deepened into an even much more rich version of myself. And it's kind of like if
[0:17:12] SPEAKER_01: you are an auntie or an uncle and you don't see your niece or nephew except like once or
[0:17:17] SPEAKER_01: twice a year. And when you see them, you're like, oh my God, you've grown so much. And the parents
[0:17:22] SPEAKER_01: don't notice because the parents are with them every day. So it was kind of showing me this like,
[0:17:28] Unknown: you're with yourself every moment of every day. It's like, let's take a little bit of a pause
[0:17:34] SPEAKER_01: while you're still alive and have a little life review moment. And I could see how
[0:17:39] SPEAKER_01: immature, how selfish, and I don't mean these things in self-deprecating way. Actually, there
[0:17:46] SPEAKER_01: was so much love and affection for that person too. It wasn't like, I'm not like her anymore. It was
[0:17:50] SPEAKER_01: like so much love and affection for her, but man, was she sleepwalking. And then with each piercing
[0:17:56] SPEAKER_01: through this painful experience, I would go down and deepen and I just wasn't as shallow. I wasn't
[0:18:03] SPEAKER_01: as unconscious. I was just a much richer, more mature version of myself. And like,
[0:18:10] SPEAKER_01: in some ways we can describe these kinds of experiences and it's like, well, when's God
[0:18:13] SPEAKER_01: going to give me my movie, you know, my life review showing when I'm in the midst of dark night.
[0:18:20] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, so I'm just a little hesitant to point out I had this profound moment of grace,
[0:18:25] SPEAKER_01: but at the same time that was given to me and I choose to do public facing work about this process.
[0:18:32] SPEAKER_01: So I'm passing it on because it was this really beautiful screening of life review of a period
[0:18:40] Unknown: of very painful years. And that was, I was kind of reminded of it in this moment in this week as like,
[0:18:50] SPEAKER_01: oh, oh, right. Like that's basic trust because there's such a persistent
[0:18:57] SPEAKER_01: drive in us when we're ego identified, which most of us are most of the time, and we're,
[0:19:03] SPEAKER_01: you know, maturing and evolving out of that at different rates. But there's such a persistent
[0:19:07] SPEAKER_01: belief that we should like what's happening in our lives all the time, or what's happening in
[0:19:12] Unknown: the world all the time. And that things should go the way we want them to go. Or think they should
[0:19:20] Unknown: go. Or think they should go. And that we can kind of outsmart God and like plan this journey in the
[0:19:29] SPEAKER_01: way that like, can't can I just feel awesome all the time? Or can I? And so basic trust isn't
[0:19:36] Unknown: basic trust that at some point, I will have improved myself enough that that God will only
[0:19:43] SPEAKER_01: give me the treats. That's not basic trust. Basic trust is. And man, like it just I feel like this
[0:19:49] SPEAKER_01: one, the bottom keeps dropping out of it. And it keeps the depth that I can go with this. It,
[0:19:54] SPEAKER_01: I think is just eternal that it's going to keep showing me just how much it's like,
[0:20:00] Unknown: wow, it's all really, really, really deepening. And I don't have to like it. And I don't have to
[0:20:08] SPEAKER_01: agree with it. And I don't have to lie back and take it. None of those things are true.
[0:20:13] SPEAKER_01: But sometimes, or for some people, frequently, you can really see
[0:20:21] SPEAKER_01: that there is an intelligence and a force of love moving through your life, sewing the needle
[0:20:27] SPEAKER_01: through the, you know, needle and thread through the fabric of your life, in a way that provides,
[0:20:33] Unknown: provides, I mean, my access now to love and contentment and fulfillment are things that I
[0:20:44] Unknown: just didn't have before. And so I don't mean it in this cheery story of like,
[0:20:50] SPEAKER_01: isn't it awesome that we suffer? No, it's it hurts that we suffer. Also, it just seems to be what
[0:20:56] SPEAKER_01: we're doing here. Like, I can't argue with that. It just seems to be what's happening.
[0:21:01] SPEAKER_01: And so is it possible? Can we live the inquiry? Is it possible to trust?
[0:21:08] SPEAKER_01: Not just that, not just the pain, but also the goodness and exactly how it's delivered exactly
[0:21:14] SPEAKER_01: the rhythms of it, the precision of it, the targeted nature exactly to what each of us needs
[0:21:21] Unknown: to be more conscious. And that is, that's a profound letting go. That's a profound surrender,
[0:21:30] Unknown: because it basically says, it basically experiences. It's even when it's horrific.
[0:21:41] Unknown: It's all good here. There is a deepening. Right. I mean, it's huge, though. That's why I think,
[0:21:50] SPEAKER_00: I mean, you said so much, that was good. There's so many things we can touch on. But
[0:21:54] SPEAKER_00: that's why I think the context of holding this in the ultimate dimension of reality
[0:22:00] SPEAKER_00: is very important. I mean, the way that H almost is bringing forward this topic is that basic
[0:22:07] Unknown: trust is an aspect of the soul. It's what the soul does. And I want to read a quote after about ego,
[0:22:15] SPEAKER_00: but he goes ultimately develop in reaction to this loss of trust. Right. So when you put it in the
[0:22:23] Unknown: ultimate dimension of reality, we're trusting that there's a rhyme or reason in a very different way,
[0:22:31] Unknown: because it's not based on time. It's not linear. It's not just based on this body and what it's
[0:22:38] SPEAKER_00: endured. It's not just based on this personality structure of Vanessa and what she's endured.
[0:22:45] Unknown: So it's this extremely large view. Now, the moments like that moment you had,
[0:22:52] SPEAKER_00: where that large view comes into the foreground of your experience as of course, this is life,
[0:23:01] SPEAKER_00: the naturally basic trust has a different way of taking shape.
[0:23:05] SPEAKER_00: But when we're in the confines of our ego structure, which as you said, for most of us is day to day,
[0:23:12] Unknown: it almost makes no sense. It totally makes no sense. And it's infuriating. Yeah, it's fucking,
[0:23:18] SPEAKER_00: it's just painful. It just doesn't make sense. And I think we can talk more about that. So
[0:23:25] Unknown: I used to have a way of saying, you know, I'd work with clients. So I'm always exploring human nature.
[0:23:32] SPEAKER_00: And I had a wish I had a wish that if people had a really tough childhood, like they went through
[0:23:38] SPEAKER_00: whatever really tough experiences they went through, whatever was creating their own version
[0:23:43] Unknown: of suffering, my wish was like on the other end, it got easier. You know, like, okay, like you did
[0:23:49] SPEAKER_00: the hard stuff. Now it gets easy. And it's a naive wish, but a wish nonetheless, because it's not what
[0:23:55] SPEAKER_00: you saw to be true. But a lot of times if people endured a certain level of suffering, a certain
[0:24:01] SPEAKER_00: kind of suffering, especially it seems the kind of suffering that turns you against yourself,
[0:24:07] Unknown: consciously or unconsciously, that if you endured a certain kind of suffering, as you went through
[0:24:13] SPEAKER_00: your adulthood, that suffering still seemed to be there in some form, whether it was lack of trust
[0:24:18] SPEAKER_00: in loving relationships, or whether it was a lack of belief in your gifts, or a lack of self love,
[0:24:25] SPEAKER_00: or a lack of belief in abundance, you know, whatever it was, it was still showing up in
[0:24:30] Unknown: this mirror of life. And I thought, how profoundly unfair, right, how profoundly unfair that people
[0:24:37] Unknown: suffer so much. And then they go on to suffer so much. Now, of course, that's only one view of
[0:24:45] SPEAKER_00: reality. It supposes that there are a bunch of people out there not suffering and had it easy
[0:24:50] Unknown: and good. And on a relative spectrum, it is true. Though I know people in very privileged positions
[0:24:57] SPEAKER_00: who seem to be suffering quite a bit inside of their own being, regardless, but still relatively,
[0:25:02] SPEAKER_00: it is true. But this concept sort of wove that all together for me, like, of course,
[0:25:09] Unknown: because the way that basic trust is formed, at least we're working with this one teacher's teaching,
[0:25:17] Unknown: is by being held in a good, supportive, beautiful environment. When you were raised in your earliest
[0:25:26] Unknown: most formative phase of life, environment mostly implies your immediate family. But not only,
[0:25:35] Unknown: it's your culture, it's the ecosystem that you're raised in. So of course, if you had a difficult
[0:25:43] Unknown: entry into this life, this trust gets ruptured. And a lot of what we then experience as internal
[0:25:52] SPEAKER_00: difficulty is a reflection of this rupture with the trust in life and also with ourselves.
[0:25:59] SPEAKER_00: Because the more that that trust is ruptured, ultimately, the farther we move from ourselves.
[0:26:05] SPEAKER_00: If we can't trust that life is unfolding perfectly, then we think we better do something,
[0:26:12] SPEAKER_00: right? Like then the pressure is on me. So I got to figure it out. So then I try to figure it out,
[0:26:18] SPEAKER_00: but I'm figuring it out from this perspective of having ruptured with myself and with life itself
[0:26:23] SPEAKER_00: from my ultimate reality. So of course, things start to go haywire. So to me, I think this was,
[0:26:32] SPEAKER_00: understanding this helped me understand a little more of my journey.
[0:26:38] SPEAKER_00: And it gave me more love and compassion as understanding ultimately does for why this
[0:26:43] SPEAKER_00: can feel so difficult for so many of us like surrender, fucking surrender, like that shit.
[0:26:50] SPEAKER_00: To this shit show?
[0:26:51] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Like, there's no intelligence here. I mean, if this is intelligence, I don't want it,
[0:26:56] SPEAKER_01: right? That's how it feels from the perspective of ego.
[0:26:59] SPEAKER_01: Many conversations on the phone, we basically just called each other to say,
[0:27:03] SPEAKER_01: if this is loving intelligence, fuck this place.
[0:27:06] SPEAKER_00: Bullshit, right? I'm going to create a different universe then because this is totally
[0:27:12] Unknown: intelligent as far as I can tell, right? From that perspective. So maybe we can get a little bit into
[0:27:22] Unknown: ego and trust just to shed some further light on this and then ultimately into
[0:27:29] Unknown: his experience of how basic trust is formed. Yeah. And it's cool. I hope I
[0:27:36] SPEAKER_00: remember at some point to Mark how the healing happens. So make sure we talk about
[0:27:42] SPEAKER_00: how one goes about healing basic trust.
[0:27:44] SPEAKER_00: You mean repairing the capacity for it.
[0:27:46] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. Repairing that just so we don't forget, because that seems to be real important.
[0:27:50] SPEAKER_01: It would be nice to have a little touch in on that.
[0:27:53] Unknown: Yeah. So it's not just a bummer. Okay. So the disturbance of basic trust is a significant
[0:28:01] SPEAKER_00: factor in ego development because the perspective of ego is diametrically opposed to the sense of
[0:28:08] Unknown: basic trust. The ego's perspective arises out of a lack of this trust. It is based on distrust,
[0:28:17] SPEAKER_00: on paranoia, on fear, on the conviction that you're not going to be adequately taken care of
[0:28:24] SPEAKER_00: and that the universe is not there to hold and take care of you in the ways you need.
[0:28:29] SPEAKER_00: This conviction causes you to believe that you have to engage in all kinds of manipulations and
[0:28:35] Unknown: games to get your needs met and to make things work out. Basic trust is the implicit confidence
[0:28:44] SPEAKER_00: in reality that results from experiencing this dimension of being this goodness, this light of
[0:28:51] SPEAKER_00: the soul. It is the trust that even if you fall, you will be held. If you let go, things will be
[0:28:57] SPEAKER_00: okay. If you let yourself not know, you will be guided. If you do not manipulate, you will be
[0:29:02] Unknown: taken care of in a way that's appropriate for you. So basically, and there's so much more we can say,
[0:29:10] SPEAKER_00: the ego structures based on these experiences in early childhood that leave an imprint on the soul
[0:29:17] SPEAKER_00: of a lack of holding, leading to a loss of contact with the loving and supportive dimension of being,
[0:29:25] SPEAKER_00: repeated experiences of physical and or emotional pain, as well as impingements from or neglect by
[0:29:32] Unknown: the environment, lead the soul to react in an attempt to bring the holding about. The soul
[0:29:39] SPEAKER_00: experiences itself as cut off, alone, separate, isolated, and it feels that it has to fend for
[0:29:46] Unknown: itself and help itself in order to survive. The distrust that is fundamental to the ego perspective
[0:29:55] Unknown: is based on not experiencing the goodness of the universe. So ultimately,
[0:30:08] SPEAKER_00: a good holding environment, that's what he's talking about, which is a psychological concept
[0:30:12] SPEAKER_00: as well. They talk about a kind of good enough mother, a good enough environment, or they talk
[0:30:17] SPEAKER_00: about a holding environment. There's an environment that's needed for the human soul to grow and
[0:30:24] SPEAKER_00: develop into what she can become. It needs to provide a sense of safety and security,
[0:30:30] SPEAKER_00: the sense that you are and can count on being taken care of. Your soul needs an environment that
[0:30:36] SPEAKER_00: is dependable, consistent, attuned to your needs, and that provides for you in a way that is empathic
[0:30:43] Unknown: to those needs. Okay. Bummer'sville has arrived. Right. How many of us had a holding environment?
[0:30:51] SPEAKER_00: I think what's really interesting about the way that he describes it is we understand there's
[0:30:58] SPEAKER_00: like capital T trauma. Okay. So capital T trauma, whether we're talking about different forms of
[0:31:04] SPEAKER_00: abuse that can take place in your early childhood, different forms of violation by your culture,
[0:31:11] SPEAKER_00: by your family, right? If we're talking about racism or misogynism, or we're talking about
[0:31:18] Unknown: actual violations by people who are close to you, we know capital T trauma does not serve as a good
[0:31:25] SPEAKER_00: holding environment for the development and unfolding of safety, security, the sense that
[0:31:32] SPEAKER_00: everything's okay. But for many people who are listening and are sensitive souls, our empaths,
[0:31:42] SPEAKER_00: it really just takes someone not being dependable, consistent, attuned to your needs,
[0:31:48] SPEAKER_00: and providing for you in a way that's empathic to those needs for you to experience this rupture,
[0:31:54] SPEAKER_00: which is important to say because I remember when I first went into therapy,
[0:31:59] SPEAKER_00: and my childhood was no fucking picnic, no doubt. There is a lot of ancestral lineage
[0:32:07] Unknown: trauma being passed down and passed down, but it certainly wasn't the worst on a spectrum.
[0:32:13] Unknown: When I first started going to therapy, I thought, okay, big baby, what are you crying about? Your
[0:32:19] SPEAKER_00: life is so, you shouldn't complain. You weren't locked in a closet. That was my perspective.
[0:32:26] SPEAKER_00: I think in part it's because of this lack of understanding about what a human needs to
[0:32:31] SPEAKER_00: flourish in their soul and how very painful it can be just simply not to have empathic
[0:32:36] SPEAKER_00: attunements to who you really are. Then the result of that being, you think you have to
[0:32:43] SPEAKER_00: do something to get it. You start to move away from your spontaneous nature in an attempt to
[0:32:50] Unknown: perform, manipulate, strategize, do, strive, get. It's ultimately the moving away from trust in
[0:32:59] SPEAKER_00: yourself and a sense of love and a sense of connectivity to everything to becoming this
[0:33:04] Unknown: isolated identity that is alone against the universe, trying desperately to figure out how
[0:33:11] SPEAKER_00: to get all of your basic needs met like love and validation and kindness. That alone, this kind of
[0:33:19] SPEAKER_00: rupture is agony. The more aware you are of it, the more you're aware of the agony of it,
[0:33:28] SPEAKER_00: which is what I think happens to a lot of empathic sensitive souls is they're just so aware.
[0:33:35] Unknown: It only takes a little bit of movement away from your natural self for you to feel the splintering
[0:33:44] Unknown: and the pain of the splintering. I don't suppose we're meant to be away from our natural selves,
[0:33:50] SPEAKER_00: even though it seems like the whole game of life because even he acknowledges we all have an ego.
[0:33:55] Unknown: It happens to all of us. There's some rupture of basic trust for all of us. There's also some
[0:34:01] SPEAKER_00: sense of basic trust for all of us. He says if you're on the spiritual path, you already have it to
[0:34:05] SPEAKER_00: a certain degree, maybe more than the average person, maybe. If you wake up in the morning,
[0:34:11] SPEAKER_00: you already have some sense of basic trust. Everyone's got some sense of basic trust
[0:34:15] SPEAKER_00: and everyone's got some ego. How crystallized it is into your identity and how crystallized it is
[0:34:23] Unknown: into your sense of this is how life works. This is the universe for you. That depends on this
[0:34:29] Unknown: earliest phase of your holding environment. I think that's huge for me to understand in
[0:34:37] Unknown: terms of bringing compassion and love and patience into the journey and also to pointing me towards
[0:34:48] Unknown: how to heal in a way that's a little clearer. A lot of times we can notice,
[0:34:56] Unknown: for lack of a better way of saying it, what the problem is, but we can't sense the way through.
[0:35:02] SPEAKER_00: We keep saying, okay, why can't I just surrender by now? What's up? I have moments of it. I do it
[0:35:08] SPEAKER_00: 5% of the time. This, I think, gives us something to point ourselves towards.
[0:35:14] Unknown: Yeah, because the ego pattern is, why can't I? I guess I'll try to, or I should X better,
[0:35:22] SPEAKER_01: or I shouldn't do so much of whatever. We can, of course, do that with this process as well,
[0:35:29] SPEAKER_01: which is exactly what holds the inability to trust life and to surrender in place.
[0:35:36] SPEAKER_00: It's the original pain. It reminds me of what La Kelly spoke about or Matt Conn in his own
[0:35:43] SPEAKER_00: language spoke about. But La Kelly, looking at the ego or the awake awareness, what they're
[0:35:49] SPEAKER_00: basically saying is the ego can't surrender. The ego can't trust because it's formed based on this
[0:35:55] Unknown: idea that one can't trust. We're not going to get it by trying to muscle ourselves into
[0:36:04] SPEAKER_00: a certain experience. We're going to get it by bringing awareness to the whole pattern,
[0:36:09] SPEAKER_00: and we can talk more about this as we go, and then allowing the soul to come into the foreground.
[0:36:15] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and I can't emphasize enough how funny over and over and over again it is when
[0:36:24] Unknown: experiences of genuine surrender and genuine trust arise. There's always right on its heels
[0:36:33] Unknown: this sensation of like, oh, I guess there's nothing for me to do here.
[0:36:43] Unknown: Because if the ego is always manhandling its way through life
[0:36:50] SPEAKER_01: and you have these moments of it just not being at all relevant to the experience you're having in
[0:36:55] SPEAKER_01: that moment, I can't tell you how endlessly shocking and surprising it always feels to me
[0:37:02] Unknown: to be like, oh, the name of the game is just like contentment, and the name of the game is just
[0:37:13] SPEAKER_01: I experience whatever I'm actually experiencing in the moment it's happening, whether that's grief,
[0:37:19] SPEAKER_01: joy, whatever it is. And there's always this feeling, it's totally like you took the ball
[0:37:26] Unknown: away from the ego on the playground and it's like, but what do I do? Just sit here in the grass?
[0:37:33] Unknown: And it's like, yeah, kind of. Well, because it means like no hope. Like to that particular
[0:37:42] SPEAKER_00: operating system, if I say to you, there's nothing for you to do here, it's like so that it's hopeless.
[0:37:48] SPEAKER_01: Right. Which I think is why Pema Chodron and many other people and Buddhist teachers in particular
[0:37:53] SPEAKER_01: point to the wisdom and the joy, the joy of hopelessness. But of course, that gets confused
[0:37:59] SPEAKER_01: and contorted. And it's like, you see a lot of your Buddhist practitioners walking around like,
[0:38:04] SPEAKER_01: yeah, it just feels good to feel like this. And it's like, I don't think it does. But it is there
[0:38:09] Unknown: is that sensation of like nothing to do. And I just want to point out, because this is something
[0:38:17] SPEAKER_01: I know a lot about, so I might as well actually bring it into the conversation.
[0:38:22] SPEAKER_01: And it's a percolating passion project of mine, I don't know where it will lead.
[0:38:28] SPEAKER_01: But so if nothing is separate, our psychological histories, our physiology,
[0:38:36] Unknown: and our spiritual path are all the same thing. And so we have done entire episodes on the nervous
[0:38:43] Unknown: system and the awakening nervous system. But I think it's important to say because it's exciting
[0:38:50] SPEAKER_01: that the fields that pay attention to the responsiveness, the adaptability, the health,
[0:38:56] SPEAKER_01: the flexibility of our autonomic nervous system, basically our nervous system's ability to even
[0:39:02] Unknown: experience safety and basic trust, that the ways that we access that, first of all, that that's a
[0:39:10] SPEAKER_01: conversation at all in our culture is amazing. It really speaks volumes about the evolution of our
[0:39:15] SPEAKER_01: species. And then that we're finding ways to repair the fact that for many of us, our nervous
[0:39:22] Unknown: system experiences harm, or no safety, no hope all the time, both in the face of grave threat,
[0:39:31] SPEAKER_01: and no threat, that there are ways that we can rehabilitate the adaptability of our autonomic
[0:39:39] SPEAKER_01: nervous system. And so I don't need to like take us all the way down that road, I would say, listen
[0:39:44] Unknown: to our awakening nervous system episode. And if you go to the show notes, I'll put in, you know,
[0:39:50] SPEAKER_01: some important resources, particularly the work of Dr. Stephen Porges. So I don't want to make this
[0:39:54] SPEAKER_01: overly cognitive. But all this is to say that this that conversation, like how do we repair
[0:40:00] SPEAKER_01: our nervous system's ability to feel safe, is an important part of this. And that that can be
[0:40:06] SPEAKER_01: really relieving, because like you were saying, it's like, oh, in some ways, just going, Oh,
[0:40:12] SPEAKER_01: I can't do this, because I can't do this. Because I don't know how because I don't have an experience
[0:40:18] Unknown: of it, or have very limited experiences of it. And there is assistance for this journey on a
[0:40:28] SPEAKER_01: nervous system level, on a psychological level, and on a spiritual level, and on a physical level,
[0:40:34] SPEAKER_01: and that when all these things come and play together, that's when we really get to feel
[0:40:39] SPEAKER_01: held in a pretty robust container of support. So I want to bring up the nervous system piece,
[0:40:48] Unknown: because for those of us who, so many of us, right, who have experienced significant ruptures,
[0:40:57] SPEAKER_01: in that capacity, we will wind up at a place in our spiritual path where awareness is really online,
[0:41:05] SPEAKER_01: and we're really aware, we're aware of the stories that the world holds, and the stories that we hold,
[0:41:12] SPEAKER_01: we're aware that we're operating through our conditioning and old ego patterns, we're aware
[0:41:16] SPEAKER_01: of the lineage that we keep playing out. And we can't seem to stop, we can't seem to not keep
[0:41:21] Unknown: doing it. So it's like we're watching the train wreck in slow motion all the time. And it's just
[0:41:29] Unknown: like, well, this does not feel good to just keep watching it. And we will wind up at a place in our
[0:41:36] SPEAKER_01: journey where, you know, we could call that dark night of the soul. And where we just are circling,
[0:41:41] SPEAKER_01: circling, circling, how do I get out of this? How do I experience trust? How do I experience safety?
[0:41:46] SPEAKER_01: And it just is like a constant gnawing terror or despair in the system. So if you are one of those
[0:41:54] Unknown: people who's going through that, there is assistance for this spiritually. You know, we talk about it
[0:42:02] SPEAKER_01: all the time here. And there's some teachers, all teachers are very adept at this, some point directly
[0:42:07] SPEAKER_01: at it, people like Jeannie Zandi. And then there's help for healthy nervous systems so that we we
[0:42:13] SPEAKER_01: don't keep it's it's like looking for something that is so in a blind spot. And you're like, I
[0:42:19] SPEAKER_01: know it's there. I know the the ability to trust and surrender has got to be there somewhere.
[0:42:26] SPEAKER_01: But if you have a big gaping blind spot in your system's ability to even see that it can be pretty,
[0:42:32] SPEAKER_01: pretty maddening.
[0:42:34] Unknown: Well, you haven't been on social media for the last month. So you wouldn't have seen this yet.
[0:42:39] SPEAKER_00: But what's funny is I posted something about basic trust, I can't remember what I posted.
[0:42:44] SPEAKER_00: And on Facebook, one of our listeners was like, and I think this may relate to the nervous system.
[0:42:49] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, Yay, listeners, genius. So we do like I hadn't been thinking of it in that moment. And
[0:42:56] Unknown: let's bring that into the conversation. And I would dare say everyone, you know, so okay,
[0:43:03] SPEAKER_00: if you had big T trauma, your nervous system may really get inflamed into unsafety.
[0:43:09] SPEAKER_00: But I would say anyone who's had a rupture has a nervous system that doesn't know how to rest.
[0:43:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, anyone who's living in a culture of dualism, which is all of right, right, you think you have
[0:43:21] Unknown: to do I mean, as soon as ego thinks that has to do something, then it's already got the nervous
[0:43:26] SPEAKER_00: system activity in a different way. And I remember a moda Ma saying, an abuda at the gas pump video,
[0:43:33] Unknown: something to I'm sorry, interview something to the effect of awakening implies a nervous system
[0:43:39] SPEAKER_00: completely at rest. Yeah. And so if we're not awake, our nervous system is not completely at
[0:43:45] SPEAKER_00: rest. That feels experientially true to me. And the more my nervous system has found safety,
[0:43:51] SPEAKER_00: the more I'm with myself, the more I'm realized, the more I feel the benevolence and the love
[0:43:55] SPEAKER_00: everywhere. And the further my nervous systems moved for that, the more I felt isolated, in pain,
[0:44:01] SPEAKER_00: in agony and cut off from everything. So clearly, the nervous system is relevant,
[0:44:07] SPEAKER_00: and can be supported and shouldn't really be left out. Because why would we, you know,
[0:44:13] SPEAKER_00: we're here to awaken in these human bodies, and the bodies seem to have a relevancy around this.
[0:44:19] SPEAKER_00: So I think it is a really good conversation. And I think ultimately, most of us could use to
[0:44:24] Unknown: rehabilitate it because to me, trust has multiple angles. Like, I've had a few people say to me,
[0:44:30] SPEAKER_00: I think I have this kind of trust. And like, Oh, this basic trust he's talking about, he's
[0:44:35] SPEAKER_00: talking about is like, it's of yourselves. He said, if you have basic trust, you don't even
[0:44:39] SPEAKER_00: know you have basic trust, because you didn't even know it was a thing. Yes, like, you never
[0:44:42] Unknown: even thought about trust. Like, right, it's so cellular and ingrained. And most of us are kind
[0:44:49] SPEAKER_00: of clying at it. And then we may have trust in different things like trust in our own ability,
[0:44:56] Unknown: we may have trust in the fact that things seem to work out pretty good for us. But most of the
[0:45:02] SPEAKER_00: time, that's conditional. So that if something was to happen that doesn't fit into that vision
[0:45:10] SPEAKER_00: of how life operates, it can have our trust come crashing down. This kind of trust that we're
[0:45:15] Unknown: referring to in this conversation is implicit, and it's unconditional, which is why he can say,
[0:45:21] SPEAKER_00: even when horrific things are happening, right, you've said there's some kind of rhyme or reason
[0:45:27] Unknown: to things. I mean, you can almost think about, you know, the story of Christ in the Bible,
[0:45:33] SPEAKER_00: like about to get crucified. And he didn't want it. He was like, Hey, he wasn't feeling great about
[0:45:40] SPEAKER_00: it. No, like, hey, you know, God, you could take this shit from me. I'd be super appreciative.
[0:45:47] SPEAKER_00: But even with that, he had, or exemplified in these stories, a sense that, okay, this is what's
[0:45:54] Unknown: meant to be right now he was in touch with his soul. He was in touch with the larger intelligence.
[0:46:02] Unknown: It's part of why we call it Christ consciousness. So I thought, let's talk a little bit about how he
[0:46:10] SPEAKER_00: thinks repair happens as well. And, and maybe we'll get to what stands in the way of it. Or
[0:46:16] SPEAKER_00: maybe that will be another conversation. We could always do a part two. Yeah, maybe that'll be this
[0:46:21] SPEAKER_00: is deep, good, juicy stuff. So yeah, really is. I feel like we could explore it for a while in
[0:46:26] Unknown: ourselves. So so I'm going to paraphrase here how he thinks the path of repair can happen. And he
[0:46:36] SPEAKER_00: didn't mention the nervous system. So we're adding that we're adding that he didn't mention
[0:46:41] SPEAKER_00: that, though, of course, he thinks meditation and things like that, that could support the nervous
[0:46:46] SPEAKER_00: system are really useful, but he didn't bring the body into it. So we can add that in our community.
[0:46:52] Unknown: But what he did say, ultimately, as I got it anyway, was two things. So one was that you have
[0:47:02] SPEAKER_00: to be aware of this lack of basic trust and the pain that it costs you. So that ultimately,
[0:47:08] SPEAKER_00: this lack of basic trust shows up in each of us in our own individual ways. Like, what does that
[0:47:13] Unknown: mean that we do? Maybe we avoid conflict the rest of our lives, maybe we identify as, you know,
[0:47:21] SPEAKER_00: the person who's in agony, maybe we try to become the person who always pleases and gives to people,
[0:47:27] SPEAKER_00: like, there's all these manifestations of basic trust, and underneath a loss of basic trust,
[0:47:33] SPEAKER_00: and underneath it, he calls them holes. And I don't know all of that information,
[0:47:37] Unknown: y'all can read him if you're interested in him, but that ultimately, there's this pain and this
[0:47:42] Unknown: longing for the kind of holding environment that you never got. Now, I remember being in therapy.
[0:47:51] SPEAKER_00: And it was always easy to point the finger at my father for creating a lot of my distress,
[0:47:58] SPEAKER_00: because he was the outwardly difficult one. He was angry, he was rageful, you know, so it was
[0:48:04] SPEAKER_00: always easy to say, Oh, my dad and to process through some of that early pain. And it was a
[0:48:11] SPEAKER_00: while in before I even turned to look at my mother. And when I turned to look at my mother,
[0:48:18] Unknown: it was a little bit about what she did and didn't do. But really, what came up and it was so
[0:48:25] SPEAKER_00: vulnerable when it came up, was the desire for more from her. I could put the words more like
[0:48:33] Unknown: protection, love, being seen. It was actually, I think the way I experienced it was just a yearning
[0:48:42] SPEAKER_00: for her. That yearning for her was the most vulnerable thing I think I let myself experience
[0:48:48] SPEAKER_00: in therapy, which is interesting. So longing, when you get to these fundamental places, like
[0:48:56] Unknown: the longing for the holding container we didn't get, can feel to some of our minds useless. It
[0:49:05] Unknown: can feel like a dead end road because there's no hope there. And so, you know, I think that's
[0:49:12] SPEAKER_00: it can feel too painful to touch. I mean, and not all of this is conscious, we just won't even let
[0:49:17] SPEAKER_00: ourselves acknowledge it. So one of the big things he says is, you have to sooner or later,
[0:49:24] SPEAKER_00: through the depth of your meditation and self inquiry and, and processes, allow yourself to
[0:49:31] SPEAKER_00: really acknowledge this deep, painful longing for what you didn't receive.
[0:49:36] SPEAKER_00: Mm hmm. Yeah.
[0:49:39] Unknown: Right. So that's, that's a big. That shit is deep.
[0:49:44] Unknown: Yeah, that's deep. But it's in his perspective, and he's worked with thousands of people,
[0:49:50] Unknown: and he's a pretty awake guy, really interesting one too, because he's very cognitive. So he
[0:49:57] Unknown: really likes to explore theory quite a bit. But in his view of working with thousands of people,
[0:50:04] SPEAKER_00: if you can acknowledge that, you'll never get at that core thing that's driving your
[0:50:10] Unknown: identity project and your fixations and your rupture from connectivity. Yeah. Okay, so that's
[0:50:18] SPEAKER_00: one piece. The second piece, which is a little more tangible and workable, is we become aware
[0:50:26] SPEAKER_00: of when the universe does have our back. And if when things unfold for our benefit, so
[0:50:34] Unknown: Brooke, the story you shared to me had many elements of that. So part one is the obvious
[0:50:41] SPEAKER_00: level. As you were getting this visual, as you were on this journey, you saw, oh, these things
[0:50:49] SPEAKER_00: that were so painful that were experienced as a rupture with the universe or a rupture with God,
[0:50:54] SPEAKER_00: whatever your word is, these things were bringing me closer to myself, closer to my soul, closer to
[0:51:00] Unknown: feeling real and whole and deep and at one. So that's one way that trust repairs is we start
[0:51:09] SPEAKER_00: to experience the benevolence and all of these different forms and we bring our awareness to it.
[0:51:15] Unknown: Oh, so I thought, you know, then the other thing is like, I thought this was going to go bad and
[0:51:21] Unknown: it didn't, right? Like I thought that person who didn't return my text hated me. I was wrong. They
[0:51:29] SPEAKER_00: love me. And so that reminds us, it gets, starts to plant a little seed, like, oh, maybe I can trust
[0:51:36] SPEAKER_00: other people. Right. And that's relative, but it's important. Even these relative moments are
[0:51:41] Unknown: important. Or like your story, my intuition told me, go home, cancel your clients, lay down. My
[0:51:52] SPEAKER_00: fear told me, don't go canceling your clients. That's irresponsible as a business owner. You're
[0:51:57] SPEAKER_00: going to lose all of your clients. You're going to be totally poor and you're just going to be in
[0:52:00] Unknown: a hole when you get to your house. Don't do it. Right. I trusted my intuition. I went home. I laid
[0:52:08] SPEAKER_00: down. I had this beautiful, profound moment of grace. My client stayed with me. I didn't go to
[0:52:13] Unknown: the poor house. Everything turned out okay. Right. And so as we keep tracking these moments, like I
[0:52:20] SPEAKER_00: remember having many moments over the course of these years of meditating and being in psychotherapy,
[0:52:28] SPEAKER_00: where you go, Oh, I surrendered and it, and it was okay. Oh, I thought I was going to die when I got
[0:52:35] SPEAKER_00: a divorce. I literally thought I was going to die. My mind was telling me you're going to fall on the
[0:52:39] SPEAKER_00: floor and die. And I didn't. And actually I had quite a bit of resilience. I got through that
[0:52:45] SPEAKER_00: heartbreak. I can handle life. I can, I can be open because I can trust in my own resilience. And you
[0:52:51] SPEAKER_00: watch that you watch like, Oh, I am different now. It's almost like as you had that vision, you saw
[0:52:56] SPEAKER_00: like, Oh my God, I've changed so much. I've taken so much. Right. Like, Oh, change does happen. Oh,
[0:53:03] SPEAKER_00: maybe this was for my heart. Good. Like every time you mark that with your awareness,
[0:53:08] SPEAKER_00: it's like we're pairing trust with someone who betrayed you on some level. And this is the part
[0:53:12] SPEAKER_00: I think we can talk about next time. On some level, once there's that rupture, you feel betrayed by
[0:53:17] SPEAKER_01: life. And at war with God, furious with God, maybe furious with God's the title of our next episode,
[0:53:23] SPEAKER_01: which means now we'll never do it. Cause I said that. Yeah. Way to go. Damn it. The curse.
[0:53:29] SPEAKER_00: Heartbroken by God or despairing, however it is, but you experience this kind of betrayal of life
[0:53:36] SPEAKER_00: to you or betrayal of yourself to you, whichever one you're conscious of, whatever the case is,
[0:53:42] SPEAKER_00: if someone betrays you in real life, they break your trust. How do you repair it? Slowly, lovingly
[0:53:50] SPEAKER_00: for yourself and with mindfulness. They did it different. They seem different. It worked out.
[0:53:55] SPEAKER_00: Okay. This is different than it used to be. Right. And slowly over time, trust gets repaired. And
[0:54:02] SPEAKER_01: it's the same with us in this case. I just want to bring in one other category of thing, because one
[0:54:07] Unknown: of the things I've noticed in myself is a bias. I have such a strong bias towards not bypassing
[0:54:16] SPEAKER_01: and not being a bliss in any and not expecting God to act like Santa Claus. I have, and I love
[0:54:21] SPEAKER_01: those things about myself and I'm glad I get to be a voice for those, but I have such a strong bias
[0:54:26] SPEAKER_01: towards them that I can sometimes not at all bring in just the delicious little joyful treats. Like
[0:54:32] SPEAKER_01: there are treats, there are treats everywhere. And so there is also the category of you thought you
[0:54:39] Unknown: really wanted one thing. It didn't go that way. And you actually got something way better. You
[0:54:48] SPEAKER_01: mentioned your divorce. You're still very close friends with your ex-husband, Frank. Hi, Frank.
[0:54:53] SPEAKER_01: We love you. You thought this has to work out forever and ever and ever. It didn't. It didn't
[0:55:01] SPEAKER_01: go the way you really thought it has to be this way. And you were delivered a much more harmonious,
[0:55:08] SPEAKER_01: satisfying, nourishing marriage. It's like, you know, I had just recently an idea. I have to move
[0:55:14] SPEAKER_01: to this town. I have to buy a house in this town. This is how it has to go. And life just kept being
[0:55:19] SPEAKER_01: like, nope, nope. I was very persistent in not paying attention and being like, no, I'm going to
[0:55:23] SPEAKER_01: keep trying. No, I made up my mind. No, it's going to work out. And then it landed me in a completely
[0:55:28] SPEAKER_01: different town, different house, different neighborhood, way better. Just for whatever reason,
[0:55:33] SPEAKER_01: I couldn't see that that was in my best interest and my son's best interest and our lives best
[0:55:39] SPEAKER_01: interest. So there is a lot of that too, that we can see and also embrace that we do actually get
[0:55:47] SPEAKER_01: upgraded things from what our mind was so sure it needed to have happen. Well, even what you're
[0:55:54] SPEAKER_00: describing, I think relates to his discussion of trust and some of the things that are barriers to
[0:56:00] SPEAKER_00: it. Because, you know, like you said, I don't know why I wasn't listening, but well, of course,
[0:56:05] SPEAKER_00: you weren't because because my mind decided has to go this way, doing something wrong. It was like,
[0:56:10] Unknown: just not giving you a thing. Right. And as opposed to, oh, well, I can trust if things aren't working
[0:56:18] Unknown: in this way, it's for my highest good. It's like all it's all perfectly baked into that conversation.
[0:56:26] Unknown: And even when you were describing, feeling like, you know, you don't want to be a bliss in any and
[0:56:32] SPEAKER_00: all those things. Well, apparently, TB continued to be continued. Apparently, this teacher would say,
[0:56:40] SPEAKER_00: those are some of the barriers that develop from the rupture. Is that we're like, well, I mean,
[0:56:47] SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to just be a bliss in the name be happy all the time. Because, you know,
[0:56:51] SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to just receive joy. That seems disingenuous.
[0:56:55] SPEAKER_00: Just focus on the positive. That's for suckers. And that's going to get me killed. Right? Like,
[0:57:01] SPEAKER_00: that's going to go real bad. Right. So all of these different things that happen
[0:57:08] Unknown: in response to this rupture early on, are some of these barriers and thoughts that come to us like,
[0:57:14] SPEAKER_00: what am I dumb? Like, yeah, I'm going to surrender 10%. I'm not going to surrender 100% because I
[0:57:19] Unknown: will be poor. I will be on the street. Right. So bless us all. Let's evoke our wonderful friend,
[0:57:30] Unknown: Jeannie's Andy, mercy to the humans. This conversation is really meant to bring us all
[0:57:37] Unknown: some context so that we can all keep walking this path with more clarity. Right. It almost like
[0:57:44] Unknown: focuses us more on how we can heal and what it looks like. And I'm more understanding of why,
[0:57:54] SPEAKER_00: you know, sometimes when you listen to spiritual teachers these days, like a lot of modern teachers
[0:57:59] SPEAKER_00: will say, all of these aspirations they have, like in Buddhism or yoga, they have ways you should live
[0:58:06] SPEAKER_00: in like the modern non dual paradigm, they'll talk about surrender, they'll talk about trust.
[0:58:11] SPEAKER_00: So there's all these different aspirations that different spiritual traditions have provided us.
[0:58:17] SPEAKER_00: And modern teachers often say, no, those are a result of awakening, not the path to it.
[0:58:28] SPEAKER_00: That's really interesting. And it's not to say don't try to be a good person, don't have morals,
[0:58:34] SPEAKER_00: don't have a compass, but is to say don't confuse that. Because the ego thinks, oh, okay,
[0:58:40] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to have these 10 commandments, and I'm going to follow them. And then I'll have heaven.
[0:58:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if joyful for no reason is what awake looks like, I'm going to walk around with a big silly
[0:58:51] SPEAKER_01: grin on my face and be that really super enthusiastic person. Like, no, that's just another mass.
[0:58:58] Unknown: Yeah, it's joyful for no reason. Totally exists. Yeah. And it's not to say don't try and it's not
[0:59:04] SPEAKER_00: to say like, drop the effort to live in integrity, because these things have their place and they are
[0:59:10] SPEAKER_00: helpful. Like the more honest I am, the more I am being true to myself. And the more I'm observing
[0:59:16] SPEAKER_00: where I can't be, which helps me untie knots. It's it's I'm not trying to make any category,
[0:59:21] Unknown: I'll do or don't do statement. All I'm inviting into the end of this conversation is that we can
[0:59:28] SPEAKER_00: go easier on ourselves, because these things that we often aspire to, they are a result
[0:59:33] Unknown: of the reparation of this sense that we are cut off, isolated, not loved, not held, and not supported.
[0:59:44] SPEAKER_00: They're a result of that. And as that heals, and it does heal progressively and over time,
[0:59:50] SPEAKER_00: and if you're lucky enough for it to heal all in one shot, bless you. But usually gradually and as
[0:59:55] SPEAKER_00: it heals, we naturally recover this and you'll find yourself surrendering a little more, trusting
[1:00:01] SPEAKER_00: a little more, existing a little more, not striving a little more.
